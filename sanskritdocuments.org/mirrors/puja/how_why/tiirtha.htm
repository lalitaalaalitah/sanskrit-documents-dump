<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>By Prabhakar Prabhu</b> </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We often visit temples and after worshipping the Lord and offering our
prayers, we are given tiirtham or holy water and prasaad (food offered to the Lord). After
having that holy water and prasaad with great reverence &amp; devotion we feel great
happiness. This &quot;tiirtham&quot; is the holy water used for the Abhisheka(bath) of the
Idol of the temple. After doing the abhishekam that particular water becomes
&quot;tiirtham&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Srimad Bhaagavatham, there is a story of Lord Mahavishnu, in his
avatar of vamana. When he started measuring the BrahmaanDa (the universe), his toe reached
the Brahmaloka (the abode of Brahma). On seeing this toe of the Lord of Lords, the creator
of the universe, Brahma, took water and poured it on the Lord&#146;s feet for washing it.
This water that flows from the Brahmaloka became the holy river Ganges. The Bhagavatam
also talks about Bhageeratha who did a rigorous penance for the sake of salvation and
peace of his forefathers. Bhageeratha did a 1000 year penance and brought the river Ganges
to earth. The holy water of the Ganges is also called &quot;tiirtha&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;When devotees are given the holy water, the following Sloka is
often chanted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>akaala mR^ityu haraNaM, sarva vyaadhi nivaaraNaM<br>
  sarva dhuritopashamanaM vishhNu paadodakaM shubham.h</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prevention of untimely death, cure for all diseases, remedy for all miseries, are all
possible by this water that has washed Lord Vishnu&#146;s feet.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">akaala mR^ityu means untimely death. When a person dies before the
completion of an average life span, by causes such as road accidents, building collapse,
fire etc., it will be called akaala mR^ityu. This Sloka says that the holy water has the
power to destroy the akaala mR^ityu or untimely death and get rid of all miseries and
diseases.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>shariire jarjarii bhuute, vyaadhi graste kaLebhare<br>
  aushadaM jaahnavii toyaM vaidhyo naaraayaNo hariH</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this Sloka we say that this holy water is like medicine. When we
become old and have diseases due to old age, this holy water has the power to reenergize
us. Lord Narayana and Sree Hari are the doctors who protect us. This is the greatness of
the &quot;tiirtha.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bhagavatam, also tells the story of Devaahuti. Devaahuti is the
wife of Kardamamuni who is the father of Lord Kapiladeva and a great sage. In this story,
Devaahuti regains her beauty and youth by taking a bath in the Bindusaras, which is a part
of the river Sarasvati. The Bhagavatam also explains how the Bindusaras originated. The
word Bindu means a drop. The story goes that the lord was happy with his devotee in a
particular moment and in that place, a drop of water fell from his eye due to this
happiness and it became Bindusaras. Kardamamuni was performing a great penance near this
river, and due to the association with this great sage, the river is said to have attained
its power of purification. Even today, the river Sarasvati is greatly revered in India.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A pilgrimage or visit to holy places such as Kaashi, prayaag etc. in
India is called &quot;tiirtha yaatra&quot;. These places and rivers became holy only
because great saints have stayed in such places in days of yore and conducted penance and
puja to the Lord. When we visit such places, we feel the lord&#146;s presence there and we
get peace of mind and happiness.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we go on a pilgrimage to holy places, it is good to understand
the importance and holiness of that place, river or temple so that we can offer prayers
with a pure mind and be inspired to offer everything to the Lord with faith and devotion.
The great saints and sages have done many years of penance and have attained knowledge
from the Lord. From this knowledge all the sR^iti, smR^iti, shaastraas and puraaNas (all
the scriptural texts), have been given by these sages for the benefit of mankind. So when
we reach these holy places with the knowledge of the greatness of such places, it will
invoke greater reverence and devotion in our minds.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many great saints and sages are referred to by the name
&quot;tiirtha&quot;, such as Srimad madhavatiirtha. This is because of their great
penance, sacrifice and unflinching devotional service to the Lord and to mankind. These
saints are considered holy, because of the way they lead their lives and hence they are
referred to as &quot;tiirtha swamis&quot;. This can be explained by the following Sloka
from Srimad Bhagavatam</p>

<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <p><em>bhavadvidhaa bhaagavathaasthiirthaa bhuutaaH svayaM vibho<br>
  tiirti kurvanti tiirtaani svaanthaH stengathaadbhrataH</em></p>
<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="trebuchet ms, arial, helvetica">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">yudhishtra says to sage vidura, &quot;You are a great devotee of Lord
KrishhNa and you yourself represent all holiness. In your heart, the Lord is ever present.
When a person like you has a bath in rivers, ponds or lakes, they also become sacred or
holy. Thus, by your presence and companionship, we also become pure. When Ordinary people
who commit many sins take bath in rivers they become impure, but when great people such as
you take bath in such rivers, again these waters becomes pure and holy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people might not be able to visit holy places. The scriptures say
that for all people their parents and teachers are the sacred and holy places or rivers.
For a noble woman, her family is itself the holy place. The Bhagavatam and the Bhagavad
Gita also talk about the mental pilgrimages, which help to purify our hearts and minds.
When a pot is filled with liquor, cleaning it externally will not really cleanse it and it
will continue to be impure as long as it is filled with something impure. Similarly, when
a person visits the holy places with an impure mind, such a visit cannot cleanse him
thoroughly. Only when our hearts are pure, we can get mental peace and happiness while
visiting holy places.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 17<sup>th</sup> chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, the lord talks
about &quot;triimaana tapas&quot; (threeway penance of body, words and mind). An
intelligent and attentive person should control his desires and purify his mind by
removing the impurities and only then he will get the benefit of the pilgrimages. It is
said in the scriptures that wealth is lost in three ways. It is either used for worldly
enjoyments or for charitable and noble actions or taken/stolen by others or used for wrong
actions. Of these ways, when wealth is used for charitable and noble actions, it is the
best way and is called &quot;uttamaM&quot;. If it is used for worldly enjoyments, it is
&quot;madhyamaM&quot; or the middle way. The last category where it is used for wrong
actions is called &quot;adhamaM&quot; or the wrong way. Hence it is necessary to use
wealth in the right way, in charities and noble actions, because this is the way to reach
the lord.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Normally, we do actions with some selfish motive. Instead we should try
and dedicate all actions to the Lord and understand that we are only instruments and He is
the doer. Our long journey of life is a pilgrimage towards God. There is a confluence of
the three rivers (triveni sangamam) of yaGYa (noble actions), daana (charity) and tapas
(penance). When we offer all our actions to the Lord and pray only for his blessings, then
we can feel the happiness of God realization. This is the most ripened fruit of the
tiirtha yaatra (pilgrimage) of life. </font></p>
