 <h2><!--mstheme--><font face="comic sans ms, arial, helvetica" color="#339999"><u>INTRODUCTION</u><!--mstheme--></font></h2>
    <p>Lord Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita (Ch4.9) &quot; Janma Karma cha may divyam yevam yo
    veththi tha-thwathah....&quot; &quot; One who knows My divine birth and activities will
    not be born again&quot;. Sri Sathyanarayana katha is one such activity of the Lord, by
    studying which we have every chance of being liberated. Sri Sathyanarayana katha forms a
    vital and integral part of this pooja. Not listening to the katha will be a major loss.
    Repeatedly hearing this story and meditating on its different aspects will make us more
    and more interested in the Lord and His activities. As the Lord Himself says further in
    Gita (Ch9.14) &quot;Sathatham keerthayantho maam yathanthascha dradhavrathaah: &quot;The
    mahaatmaas among devotees, always speak and sing My glories, and try with determination,
    to realize Me&quot;</p>

    <p>OM SHRI SATHYANARAYANAYA NAMAH</p>
    <p>Shri Sathyanaranayana katha is from Skandha purana, Reva kaanda. Sutha Puraanikji was
    the narrator of these stories, in Neimishaaranya to the rishis lead by Shounakji who were
    performing a 1000 year yajna for the benefit of mankind. </p>
    <p>Shounakaji and others now ask Suta Puranikji an important question. &quot;When a man
    has a desire, how can he fulfill that ethically sound desire? By worshipping whom, by what
    vrita, or tapas? Please let us know.</p>
    <p>Sutaji was pleased to know that this question they asked, was for the benefit of the
    mankind and not for their personal benefit, for, they had abandoned their homes and all
    desires. Sutaji said &quot; this question was also asked by Devarshi Naradaji once to Lord
    Narayana Himself; Let me tell you that story.</p>
    <p>Once Naradaji was traveling all over the worlds and finally came to Bhuloka, where he
    found almost everyone was suffering one or the other misery on account of their past
    Karmas and were not knowing how to extricate themselves from their untold miseries which
    were multiplying everyday on account of their ignorance. Being a Satjana his heart felt
    their agonies and immediately he reached Vaikunta, to Lord Narayana to find the right
    answer for getting the people out of their miseries. But when he sees the Lord, being a
    great devotee of the Lord, he forgets his purpose and starts praising the Lord. The Lord
    Narayana smiles at him and asks the purpose of his visit, knowing that normally Naradaji
    does not visit Him without a purpose. Naradaji tells Him what he saw and requests Him a
    panacea for all such miseries. The Lord is now happy at this question of Naradaji because
    of Naradaji&#146;s intention of benefiting the world by seeking the right answer. The Lord
    said:</p>
    <p>Yes, there is a vrita called Sri Satyanarayana vrita which is not known to the
    inhabitants of the Bhuloka. This is a secret and yet since your interest is the benefit of
    the mankind, I shall narrate to you this vrita. This can be performed by anyone (anyone
    means it does not need an expert or a priest to worship the Lord - ANYONE of any caste,
    community, creed can worship the Lord directly) and very easily. One who does this, will
    get all the benefits and the pleasures of this world and will eventually get Moksha too.
    Now Narada wants to know more details of this vrita. The Lord says, this can be done any
    day, in the evening. Gather friends and relatives and perform this vrita with faith and
    devotion. The prasad for this vrita is known as Sapaad which is prepared thus: Take an
    equal measure of rava, Milk, Ghee, Banana, Sugar ( the measure should be 1 1/4 or
    multiples thereof ) cook it till all mix into a paste. The night should be spent in
    Bhajans and praise of the Lord. All those attending Pooja should be given food and
    respect. Thus the performer will get all his wishes fulfilled.</p>

    <p>Sri Lord Narayana tells Narada the further story: </p>
    <p>There was an old and poor Brahmin in the city of Kashi. He was a man of virtue and yet
    extremely poor and was always begging for the next meal. Since the Lord is Viprapriya-
    (Brahmana priya means Lover of Brahmana- Brahmana means anyone on the devotional path ) -
    He came in the guise of an old Brahmin and accosted him &quot; Tell me my friend, what
    ails you?&quot;. The brahmin replied &quot;I am an old and very poor man and I shall be
    grateful if you can tell me how to get rid of this poverty of mine which does not seem to
    leave me&quot;. The Lord replied &quot;Why don&#146;t you perform Sri Satyanarayana
    Vrita&quot;, and He told him how to perform the Vrita.</p>
    <p>The poor man now desires to do this vrita and thinking over these thoughts of the Lord
    he goes to bed. He could not sleep on account of these thoughts. Again in the morning he
    had same thoughts and he says to himself, &quot;whatever I earn today by begging I shall
    use it to perform the vrita&quot;. Since the Lord likes such feelings, (Bhavena Devam -
    Lord does not want our material possessions, he is won by the genuineness of our feelings)
    that day, he got plenty of money while begging and thus pleased, he took the necessary
    articles and performed the vrita.</p>
    <p>Very soon he became rich and had all the things of the world and thereafter he started
    performing the vrita every month and thus he enjoyed all the pleasures of the world and
    finally reached the Moksha too.</p>
    <p>Now Shaunakji and other rishis want to know how this vrita spread in the world. Also
    those who have heard the story, what benefits they got. Sutaji replies:</p>
    <p>Once when this brahmin was performing the Sri Satyanarayana Pooja there came to his
    house a woodcutter. He saw the pooja and wanted to know what it is and what are its
    fruits. The brahmin said, &quot;This is Sri Satyanarayana Pooja. Whatever desires you have
    in your mind will be fulfilled by performing this vrita. My own poverty and troubles all
    ended by my very decision to perform this vrita&quot;. On hearing this, the woodcutter
    prostrates to the Lord, takes prasad, and decides to perform this pooja next day. He
    thought in his mind, &quot;Whatever amount I get from the sale of the wood tomorrow, I
    will use it for the performance of the vrita.&quot; That day he sold the wood for twice
    the price. Happily thinking of the Lord Satyanarayana he proceeds to do this pooja,
    inviting his friends and relatives. Thus performing regularly he became rich and happy and
    finally reached Satyaloka.</p>

    <h2><!--mstheme--><font face="comic sans ms, arial, helvetica" color="#339999"><u>CHAPTER III</u><!--mstheme--></font></h2>
    <p>Suta Puranikji continues the story:</p>
    <p>Once there was a good king called Ulkamukha. He was wedded to truth and sense- control.
    Everyday he used to go to the temple, worship the Lord, distribute alms to the needy. Once
    he was performing Sri Satyanarayana Vrita on the banks of a river. At that time there came
    a merchant in a ship loaded with precious goods. He approached the king and wanted to know
    the details of the pooja and also its fruits. The king said, &quot;My friend, what we are
    doing is a vrita called Sri Satyanarayana Pooja. This is done with a desire to have
    progeny, wealth, property, etc. By this, we are worshipping Lord Narayana or
    Mahavishnu&quot;.</p>
    <p>The merchant said, &quot;Please tell me the details as to how to perform this vrita,
    because I would like to have children whom I have not been fortunate to have till
    now.&quot; The king tells him the details of the vrita and the merchant returns home. He
    tells the details to his wife and they decide to perform this vrita if they get a child.
    Sometime later his wife Lilavathi became pregnant and delivered a girl who was named
    Kalavathi. Lilavathi reminded her husband about the vrita and he kept postponing it, till
    his daughter grew of age and was ready to be married. The father finds a suitable groom
    and marries her off and again forgot to perform the vrita although he had decided to do so
    at the time of marriage of his daughtier. The Lord now wanted to remind him.</p>
    <p>The merchant and his son-in-law were in a city called Ratnasara where king Chandrakethu
    was ruling. There was a theft at the palace and the burglars were chased by the police.
    The running burglar saw these two merchants resting near a tree and they left the booty
    with them and ran off. The police caught the two merchants with the stolen goods and they
    were straight away sent to the prison. The king himself overlooked to investigate. It is
    this time the merchant suddenly realized that this was all on account of his forgetting
    the promise to the Lord. At about this time, back home both Lilavathi and her daughter
    Kalavathi lost all their belongings due to thefts at home and were rendered beggars.
    During one such wandering trying to find some food Kalavathi sees Sri Satyanarayana Pooja
    being performed at one house. She goes in, hears the story and details and returns to tell
    her mother what had taken place. Lilavathi now knows that it is their forgetting to do the
    Pooja that had created all these problems. Next day she calls her relatives and friends
    and performs the Pooja, begs for forgiveness. Accordingly, the king had a dream that the
    merchants were innocent and he releases them on inquiry and gives them lot<font face="wealth"> wealth.</font></p>

    <p>Suta Puranik continues the story: </p>
    <p>Thus released from the custody the merchants were returning home. They reached the
    outskirts of their town in their ship. The Lord in order to test them again comes in the
    form of an old Sanyasi and inquires as to what the load in the ship is. The merchant
    bluffs and says that it contains dried leaves. The sanyasi says &quot;Tathasthu&quot;.
    When the merchant returns to the ship he finds that it does contain now dried leaves only.
    He swoons and when he regains his consciousness he realizes that these are doings of the
    Sanyasi whom he had cursorily dismissed earlier. He seeks him out and begs for
    forgiveness. The ever-merciful Lord again forgives him. Now that the merchant was near the
    town, he sends a messenger in advance to Lilavathi to let her know that they are on their
    way home. Lilavathi. tells her daughter to complete the Satyanarayana poola they were
    performing and goes ahead to meet her husband. Kalavathi does the pooja, but in a hurry to
    meet her husband, she neglects to take the prasad; and when she nears the anchorage, she
    does not find the ship nor her husband! It looked to her that they both sank/drowned. She
    swoons and now she decides to die.</p>
    <p>The merchant thinks that this must be on account of some fault on their part in
    ignoring the Lord and then and there he decides to do the pooja as a part of expiation
    from his side for mistakes of omission or commission. The Lord now pleased makes him
    realize that it is the daughter&#146;s oversight in not accepting the prasad that has
    created this problem and now if she goes and takes the prasad, everything would be all
    right.</p>
    <p>Kalavathi returned to the altar and took prasad with all faith and reverence. And her
    husband returned and from then onwards, they all performed Sri Sathyanarayana Pooja
    regularly till the end of their life and finally after death, they reached Satyaloka.</p>

    <p>{ 5th chapter is important to us as we too tend to behave like the King in this story,
    in respect of other peoples&#146; pooja/worship/religion }</p>
    <p>In the woods of Nemisharanya Suta Puranikji continued the story narrating the greatness
    of this Vrita to Shounaka and other Rishies:</p>
    <p>In ancient times, there was a King called Angadwaja. He was good and righteous king
    {like all of us, good and righteous}; and yet once he ignored the prasad of Sri
    Satyanarayana Pooja and had to suffer very dearly to that.</p>
    <p>Once this king was returning from hunting the wild animals in the forests. He rested
    under a tree for a while. A few yards away a small group of cowherd boys had gathered to
    perform Sri Satyanarayana Pooja. They did not have anything except their daily bread they
    were carrying and a talkative among them became their priest and they played the game of
    doing a pooja. At the end of the pooja, they offered the prasad to the king who, out of
    contempt and pride, left it untouched. </p>
    <p>Pretty soon all his wealth was lost; his hundred children died and he now knew, being a
    good king that this was all on account of his contempt for those children&#146;s pooja.
    Without any delay the king goes to that very spot where the cowherd boys had done the
    pooja earlier, gathers them all around him performs the Satyanarayana Pooja with all
    shraddha and bhakthi. </p>
    <p>Thus the king again got all his wealth and kingdom and kins.</p>
    <p>Suta now tells the Rishis that this Vrita is specially effective in Kaliyuga. This Lord
    of Lord is called Ishwara, Satyadeva, Sri Satyanarayana and by many other names. He alone
    has taken names and forms. </p>
    <p>One who reads this story and one who hears it will be rid of all woes and difficulties.</p>
