  <p>Congratulations and goodwishes for the noble and essential project of Gyan<br>
  Bharati classes. A most wonderful and meaningful question/quest indeed.<br>
  As desired we endeavour to discuss this Mahamantra at two levels based on<br>
  audiance receptivity:</p>
  <h3><!--mstheme--><font face="comic sans ms, arial, helvetica" color="#339966">Bala (young) satsanghees:<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p>The founder of this mahamantra (invocation to the Lord or meaningful prayer<br>
  to the Lord) is sage Vishwaamitra Rishi. He was born a king, and after<br>
  loosing battles after battles with sage Vasistha by using various arms and<br>
  ammunition, he prayed to the Lord for many many years and attained a higher<br>
  degree of knowledge with the title &quot;Rajarshi&quot; meaning, even being a king,<br>
  he also attained a high level of knowledge of the Lord; but he wanted to<br>
  attain the same level as Vasistha, that is to become a &quot;Brahmarshi&quot; &quot;<br>
  knowler of Brahma&quot;, ie, the one who sees in everybody else the same Lord;<br>
  simply put, the one who loves everybody equally and acknowledges that the<br>
  Great universal power called by different names is ONE SINGLE ENTITY.<br>
  After lot more study, practise, he finally attains that knowledge and is<br>
  one among the &quot;Saptharshis&quot; &quot;7 great knowledgeable and realised
  teachers&quot;<br>
  <br>
  The prayer &quot;Gayatri Mantra&quot; is addressed to the Lord Sooryanarayana, or<br>
  &quot;Sun God&quot;; Sun is the everyday visible (exception North/South poles!) power<br>
  of that Universal Power/Lord and is the LIFE SUSTAINING POWER FOR ALL,<br>
  PLANT, ANIMAL AND HUMAN LIVES.<br>
  <br>
  You all know that early morning without fail everyday He rises and if we<br>
  have slept well in time in the previous night, we too automatically get up<br>
  or our sleepy nature quickly departs, and we are &quot;up and about&quot;
  &quot;fresh&quot;;<br>
  when your parents ask you to do some ticklish maths or science study just<br>
  before bed-time, you would say &quot; I will do it tomorrow morning when I am<br>
  fresh or my brain is clear!&quot;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>1. So we pray to Him &quot;I pray for clear and steady mind, without doubts<br>
    about what my teachers and parents teach&quot;</p>
    <p>2. I pray that I do not unnecessarily get angry just because something<br>
    being told is not agreeable to me at my present state of knowledge; I will<br>
    analyse it without passion( impartially) and accept it.</p>
    <p>3. Just as the brilliant rays of sunshine/sunrays brighten up the whole<br>
    world/universe, I pray the Lord expands my knowledge base and fills any<br>
    vacuums (dark spots) of &quot;ignorance&quot; with the Light of Knowledge, through my<br>
    teachers and parents/friends teachings, by observing good practice, etc.<br>
    A room may be in total darkness for 100 years, but the instant a candle or<br>
    a lamp is lit in that room, it does not take 100 years for the &quot;darkness&quot;<br>
    to leave the room, it is &quot;dispelled&quot; instantly. Similarly, Oh Lord, is the<br>
    Power of Your rays of bright knowledge -Let that shine one me..</p>
    <p>4.I pray that You enhance my undrstanding of how to live in this world in<br>
    harmony with the nature and the beings (animals,human beings included!)</p>
    <p>5. I pray that by listening to such teachings and practising good conduct,<br>
    I be made aware quickly whenever I am not on the right path, so that I can<br>
    correct my course quickly and get back into the RIGHT TRACK, in my studies,<br>
    in my relationships, in my workplace, in my society and World at large.</p>
    <p>6. I pray that the Lord gives me such clear and right judgement power over<br>
    my own anticipated action-plan or impulsive actions/decisions I take,<br>
    without having to deliberate for long on &quot;what is right action and what is<br>
    not-right action&quot;(Dharma-Adharma)</p>
    <p>7. I pray that the Lord grants me the power to undrstand various<br>
    simple/complex situations in the life, and how to appropriately and<br>
    correctly conduct myself in my meeting and associations with people of<br>
    different personalities/traits, and Oh Lord, pray that by Your Grace let my<br>
    actions be always Right.</p>

  <p>SUN is our greatest benefactor. Sun is the source of energy to plant<br>
  life, He evaporates the seawater and thus enable us to get sweet rain-water<br>
  which is the source of all rivers and our only source of water (even the<br>
  desalinated water supply is also possible only because the seawater in the<br>
  ocean is constantly replenished by Him by rains in one part of the world or<br>
  the other, or through the Greenhouse effect, accumulated 'storage of sweet<br>
  water&quot; ice/snow melts to supplement the source of water!.) He gives us<br>
  light, He gives us heat, He gives coolness (Moon is the reflection of<br>
  sunlight as you know); he is the processor of all food (plant life<br>
  germinates, grows, flowers, bears fruits/vegetables, fruits ripe and<br>
  vegetables grow to the required consumuable state, and old plants/dead<br>
  animals etc dry up and merge back with the mother earth thus cleansing the<br>
  Environment); He ensures that the plant life/trees produce oxygen for us.<br>
  And above all, he is TIME, we count yesterday,today,tomorrow everything on<br>
  the basis of HIS MOVEMENT. So to that Lord of UTMOST POWER AND GREATNESS<br>
  AND KINDNESS WE BOW DOWN AND PRAY ALL THE TIME.<br>
  <br>
  SUN never fails and does His Duty EVERYDAY AT ALL TIMES. Once Anjaneya<br>
  (Maruthi,Hanumanji) approached SUN UNIVERSITY (Sun God) and requested him<br>
  to teach him ALL KNOWLEDGE. The Sun Lord said &quot;I cannot stop and teach,<br>
  if you are prepared to follow me day and night, I will continue my daily<br>
  duties to the World and at the same time teach you too. The great and<br>
  gallant Hanumanji (He was only 10 year old at that time) not only agreed to<br>
  learn whilst travelling, but with utmost humility and respect to his<br>
  Teacher the Sun Lord, learnt ALL KNOWLEDGE in 60 days by traversing<br>
  backwards (facing the Lord all the time) at equal speed!<br>
  Now don't you want to say &quot;Three cheers to Lord Sun&quot; (and Shri Ramadasa<br>
  Hanumanji)?<br>
  <br>
  That is what we do in the above Great prayer Shri Gayatri Mahamantra in<br>
  &quot;Sanskrit&quot; language.</p>
  <h3><!--mstheme--><font face="comic sans ms, arial, helvetica" color="#339966">ALL SATSANGHEES:<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
  <p>Above discussion has extended beyond the normal &quot;one page rule&quot; set by<br>
  our Guruji for cyber satsangh contributions. Fortunately, I have the<br>
  plausible excuse &quot;you have asked the Mother of All Questions!&quot; As you know<br>
  the 4th Ch B.G. Lord Krishna starts saying that originally he gave the<br>
  &quot;Knowledge&quot; to Vivaswaan (Sun Lord); even the summary/ 1st dhyana sloka of<br>
  Shrimad Bhagavata &quot;Janmaadhysya yatoo...... Satyam Param Dheemahi&quot; is<br>
  considered by Great Acharyas as explanation of this Great Mahamantra - in<br>
  other words the Lord is this Mantra and the total connotation, so far<br>
  fathomed by Great Rishis or &quot;unfathomable&quot;(Achinthya) KNOWLEDGE IS THIS<br>
  SOOYAPRAKASHA, &quot;Knowledge Light&quot;.<br>
  <br>
