<p>Ramaayana is one of the two itihaasa [historical account] scriptures of Sanathana Hindu
Dharma. It contains the story of Lord Raama the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu in the
tretaa yuga - referred to as the silver age among the four ages in a Mahaayuga. Ramayana
along with Mahaabharaatha is the most popular amongst the Hindus all around the world
today and in fact is even considered by many as a fifth veda.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original Ramaayana was authored by Rishi Valmiki in Sanskrit.
However, it has been written in most of the Indian languages, a few of them being Sant
Tulsidas&#146; Ram Charitramanas in avadhi and Kambar&#146;s Kambaraamayanam in Tamil. The
Interesting thing about Ramaayana is that it unfolded after it was written. The incidents
that were to happen around the seventh avataar of Lord Vishnu were revealed to sage
Valmiki before they even took place. Once Sage Valmiki watched two Krauncha birds sitting
on a tree. Suddenly one of the Krauncha bird fell down after being hit by a hunter&#146;s
arrow. Seeing this incident, Valmiki was so overcome with pain and compassion for the bird
on one hand and on the other, he was very angry with the hunter that he cursed him that he
will not attain bliss for eternity. It is said that the oyster breeds the pearl in a
moment of irritation. This incident spurred Rishi Valmiki to compose this Adi Kavya. There
is also a belief amongst certain circles that Lord Vishnu played out the role of Lord
Raama as dictated in the Raamayana.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The entire Raamayana is like a game of chess. The scene set is kind of
a battlefield where the forces of right and wrong are waging war. Rama represents
righteousness and Ravana represents unrighteousness. Some might ask, Is it not the same
theme as in Mahabhaaratha? However there are some interesting differences between Lord
Raama and Lord Krishna - the avataars of Lord Vishnu. Raama was born as a prince and died
as a king but lived as an ascetic. Krishna, on the other hand was born in a prison, and
died to a wound caused by a hunter&#146;s arrow but lived as a king all his life. In the
form of Raama, Lord Vishnu plays a role of an <i><b>ideal human being</b></i> whereas as
Krishna, He reveals that He is God incarnate.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the sacred epic of Raamayana, many profound secrets and truths are
hidden. Lord Raama, however, did not impart these secrets to anyone at anytime. Just as a
ripened fruit falls to the ground, so also people with ripened hearts alone will realise
the truth. Whatever stage we are in, let us try to listen carefully and contemplate upon
the various khandaas which are being summarised so that we would understand the greatness
of this epic. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raamayana stresses on bhakthi- yoga - the yoga of devotional love. Lord
Raama represents the ideal man, Sitaadevi, the ideal woman and Hanumanji is the epitome of
a bhaktha. In fact some people refer to Raama as Rama, meaning a woman. Raamayana also
means that it is a story of Sitadevi.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raamayana represents the best of relationship among humans whether it
is between father and son or between husband and wife or between brothers or between a
disciple and his master. Even the raakhshasas followed a strict code of conduct in their
relationships. The story of Lord Raama is not that of a single towering personality . All
other characters in Raamayana whether it is Sitadevi or Lakshmana or Bharata, shine in
their own greatness. All of them are so closely interwoven in Lord Raama&#146;s life that
it is difficult to think of anyone without the other. In fact it is Lord Raama who is
always the first to appreciate the unique and noble qualities in other&#146;s character.</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where in lay the secret of this unique greatness in Raama&#146;s
personality</b></i>? He is called Maryadha Purushottama- the great one who never deviated
from the norms of Dharma. In the eyes of a Hindu, the touchstone of human excellence is
Dharma. Devotion to Dharma came first in Raama&#146;s life. It was his supreme commitment
to putra-dharma that made Raama smilingly depart to the forest for fourteen years. Again
He did not budge from the path of Dharma when he was made the future emperor of Bharat.
Don&#146;t we recite in Vishnu Sahasranama that Raama is Dharma himself :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Ramo Viramo Viraj, Marg Neyo Neyonayah<br>
  Veera Shakthimathan Shresta, Dharmo Dharmavidhutamma</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lord Raama was ready to forsake everything else to uphold his kingly
duties - Rajdharma and take care of his countrymen. In fact he once told Sitadevi that he
would not hesitate to sacrifice even her if the welfare of the people of Ayodhya required
it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Sneham dayaam cha soukhyam cha, yadi vaa jaanakimapi<br>
  Aaraadhanaaya lokasya, munchate naasti me vyatha. </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the most crucial test came when Lakshmana violated the orders of Lord Raama
and admitted Durvasa&#146;s presence with a view to averting the destruction of Ayodhya by
Durvasa&#146;s curse. Raama stuck to the Law of the land and awarded death sentence to
Lakshmana- one whom he loved dearer than his own life. Such was Lord Raama&#146;s intense
adoration and love for the motherland and this is revealed in the following legendary
couplet </p>

<blockquote>
  <i><b><p>Janani Janmabhoomischa Swargaadapi Garreyasi </b></i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that the mother and motherland are greater to me than the heavens
themselves.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sri Raama&#146;s role as one of the first and foremost national
unifiers of Bharat is also unique and extraordinary. He embraced Guha, the boatman and
also enjoyed the fruit offered with devotion by Shabari, a tribal lady without any
hesitation. Lord Raama has become so much identified with all the good, great and virile
qualities of a human being that expressions such as &quot;Us me Ram nahi Hai&quot; have
become common usage.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What have we to learn from Raamayana</b> ?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world today is in dire need of the message of the Raamayana.
Jealousy, Hatred, disobedience, selfishness - all these evils has had bad influence on the
society. Raama preached to the world the basic truth that the world is one family besides
teaching the duties one should perform in everyday life in a society and towards a family.
This triple stream of duties is the message of Raamayana. We need to perform our duty in
the best possible manner like Lord Raama did.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Raama dwells in the heart of everyone. He is the indwelling spirit.
When we sing &quot; Atmaraama&quot; week after week, this is exactly what we mean.
Ayodhya, where Raama resides, symbolises our heart. Only if we keep our heart pure and
firm, there will be room for Raama to stay forever. Among the many avataars of the Lord,
the avataar of Lord Raama is also unique in the sense that the word &quot;Raama&quot; is
not only a name but also a mantra in itself. Has not the Phalasruti we say in Vishnu
Sahasranamam - Sri Raama Raama Ramethi&#133;.. been equated to reciting the entire
sahasranamam ?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lord Raama taught us how to remain unruffled in the presence of
difficulties or joys, in pain or pleasure. A good man by his good conduct achieves
greatness. These are the qualities, which everyone should cultivate. In fact the
comparison of Sri Raama&#146;s fortitude and strength to the Himalayas and the grace of
his personality to the ocean- <b>Samudra iva Gambheerye, dhairye Cha Himavaan iva</b>
portrays how his personality has been blended with the entire country.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a Hindu&#146;s acting in this world comes to an end, he is bid
Raam Naam Satya Hai. Before we are bid such a farewell, let us atleast put into practice
the teachings of Lord Raama. Vishnu Sahasranamam gives an assurance by saying <b>Priyakrut
Pritivardhana</b> meaning when we stay in his path namely Dharma and Satya, he not only
bestows all the desires but also takes the responsibility of keeping the devotee steadfast
in his love and devotion towards him. Again the last reference to Sri Raama in the Vishnu
Sahasranama is the word &quot;Kshitisham&quot; &quot;Kshitisham&quot; means a king. The
Sahasranamam confirms Lord Ramaa to be our king and urges everyone to take the guidance of
Ramaayana. </p>
