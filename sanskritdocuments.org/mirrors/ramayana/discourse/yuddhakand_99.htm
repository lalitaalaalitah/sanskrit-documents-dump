<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">After Hanuman returned to lord Rama&#146;s
camp after completing his mission of finding the whereabouts of sita, Lord Rama and
Sugriva marched with their Vanara army towards the southern sea. When the Vanara army
reached the Mahendra mountains they rested for a while. The spread of the Vanara army on
the hill tops was a glorious sight though fiery.&nbsp; It appeared as if the whole earth
was covered with monkeys, monkeys and more monkeys.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In Lanka, Ravana, who learnt through his
spies about the Vanara army camping on the other side was very much worried. He summoned
his ministers for advice. All of them praised Ravana to the sky declaring that he was
unconquerable . These words comforted him and boosted his pride. Ravana also consulted his
brothers Vibishana and Kumbhakarna . Vibishana advised Ravana to return Sita to Rama and
make peace with him but Ravana would not listen to him. Vibishana and his 4 friends left
Lanka and took refuge in Rama. However Kumbha karna agreed to fight for his brother
Ravana.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Back in Rama&#146;s camp, Sugriva, Lakshmana
and Vibishana discussed the ways and means to cross the sea. Rama prayed to the Lord of
the Ocean for a passage for which Samudra raja appeared before him and suggested that they
build a bridge with the help of the architect Nala who was in the Vanara army. The bridge
was completed in 5 days using stones and boulders. The entire Vanara army then crossed the
sea and reached Lanka.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In the meantime, Ravavna thought of a
devious plan to make Sita yield to him, which he hoped would make Rama go back disgraced
and broken hearted. With the help of a magician Vidhudjihva, a head resembling that of
Rama was produced before Sita. Ravana with all his pride now announced to Sita that he had
killed Rama. Just then, due to an emergency, Ravana had to rush back to the Council Hall
to meet his Generals. When he left, the illusory head of Rama also vanished leaving Sita
totally perplexed. Sarama, one of the rakshasis who cared for Sita comforted her, saying
that Rama was alive and safe in Lanka, and that she was now only deceived by Ravana&#146;s
magic.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The Vanara army was now getting ready to
fight &#150; only waiting for the green signal form Lord Rama. However,&nbsp; Lord Rama
had different ideas. True to his noble character, Dharmatma Rama tried now to avert the
war by sending Angada to Ravana as a messenger of peace, but Ravana did not want this
peace. On the contrary he tried to kill Angada, who however managed to escape.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">At this stage, Rama declares a full fledged
war on Lanka.&nbsp; He ordered his Vanara army to attack.&nbsp; The Vanara&#146;s used
uprooted trees &amp; boulders to attack the Rakshasas. Thousands were killed on either
side and the battle field was soaked in blood.&nbsp; It appeared as if Rama&#146;s army
was gaining the upper hand. At this time, Indrajit adopted his Maya tactics and shot the
Nagapasa at Rama &amp; Lakshmana.&nbsp; The Serpants from the arrow hit them, and soon
Rama &amp; Lakshmana both fell to the ground, bound hand and foot.&nbsp; Seeing their
Masters down, the Vanaras panicked.&nbsp; Indrajit thought that Rama &amp; lakshmana were
dead, and soon this message was conveyed to Ravana.&nbsp; Ravana now instructed one of the
Rakshasis Trijatha to take Sita to the battle field on the Pushpaka Vimana to show her the
dead bodies of Rama &amp; Lakshmana. Though initially Sita lost her balance, she was soon
consoled by the friendly Trijatha that both Rama &amp; lakshmana were alive.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, the celestial eagle Garuda came
into view at the battle field.&nbsp; At his sight, the serpants binding the two brothers
fled away. Garuda now stroked the faces of Rama &amp; Lakshmana with his wings and their
wounds were healed.&nbsp; Both Rama &amp; lakshmana rose refreshed as if from a long
sleep. Garuda then flew away.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The joy which Rama&#146;s army experienced
on seeing their Masters fully recovered was indescribable.&nbsp; The sounds of their drums
and bugles filled the air. They resumed their attack with greater vigour.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ravana sent many great Generals to the battle front but they were all killed.&nbsp; At
last Ravana himself&nbsp; mounted his chariot&nbsp; and came to the battle field. A fierce
battle took place.&nbsp; Ravana shot the powerful Brahmasthra at Lakshmana and made him
unconscious.&nbsp; Hanuman hit Ravana with his feet, and then quickly carried away
Lakshmana to Lord Rama to review him.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Now it was the turn of Rama to fight Ravana
one to one. Ravana could not stand the mighty power of Lord Rama. Ravana was deeply
wounded, his bow fell down from his hands, his chariot was smashed, and he stood
helplessly before Rama.&nbsp; Lord Rama now showed once again how noble he was. He took
pity on Ravana and asked him to come the next day to fight in a new chariot with fresh
weapons.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Ravana was devastated. He was not only
ashamed, but his pride was humbled. He ordered Kumbakarna to be woken up from his sleep
and to take part in the battle. However Kumbhakarna was defeated by Rama. Similarly, the
other sons of Ravana too were wiped out by the Vanara army.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">On hearing the news, Ravana sat dejected in
his palace. Seeing his plight, Indrajit vowed to finish off once and for all, Rama &amp;
Lakshmana at once. He used his Maya tactics and becoming invisible, he showered powerful
arrows on the Vanaras.&nbsp; They became totally powerless against an enemy they could not
see. Finally, Indrajit discharged the sacred Brahmasthra which made Rama, lakshmana and
the Vanaras unconscious. Jambhavan then instructed Hanuman to go to the Sanjeevini Parvat
and get the four wonderful herbs which alone could bring the dead back to life.&nbsp;
Hanuman, on reaching the Sanjivini Parvat could not make out which were the specific
herbs, and so he uprooted the entire mountain and flew back to Lanka. At the very smell of
the herbs, Rama, Lakshmana &amp; the Vanaras leapt to life with their wounds healed.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>In modern times, success is measured by
the skill and personality of a person, but though skill and personality are needed to
achieve success, it can never guarantee happiness and fulfillment. These can come only
from developing character.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to conclude by saying that
Ravana&#146;s life is an ideal example of the Greek<b> </b>proverb<b> &#147;character is
destiny&#148;. </b>Ravana, no doubt was a very great person, but inspite of being
repeatedly advised by wise men to return Sita&nbsp; back to Rama, he refused to do so.
Thus his <b>pride, and passion for Sita overpowered him, and he was destined to
destruction.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Jai Sri Ram</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#009900" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Ms. Usha Satyan</u></i></b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">After the death of Kumba karna, his sons
Kumba and Nikumba accompanied by several warriors came to destroy vanaras.&nbsp; Sugriva
with a powerful hit of his mighty fist felled Kumba to the ground and he died.&nbsp;
Hanuman pushed Nikumba to the ground and sat on his chest.&nbsp; Nikumba was strangled to
death and his head was wrenched off his body.&nbsp; Then Indrajit, son of Ravana, who is
his greatest strength rose up into the sky and hiding himself behind the clouds, he began
to harass the brothers.&nbsp; Many vanaras were killed and Rama made up his mind to kill
the son of Ravana.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Lakshmana used the astra &quot;AINDRA&quot;
which traveled like a streak of lightning and it severed the beautiful head of Indrajit
from his body and it fell to the ground.&nbsp; Indrajit who had captured Indra and brought
him to his fathers city as a captive was killed by the astra which was ironically enough,
presided over by Indra.&nbsp; Rama was very happy and thrilled at the achievement of his
beloved Lakshmana.&nbsp; Ravana could not believe that his Indrajit could die.&nbsp;
Ravana was inconsolable and his grief turned into anger.&nbsp; Ravana attacked the vanaras
with all his pent up fury and hatred.&nbsp; Lakshmana and Vibheeshana tried to bar
Ravana's way but they were not successful. When he saw Vibheeshana, Ravana's fury doubled
and he shot a blazing arrow at him but Lakshman stopped it midway.&nbsp; Ravana shot
another blazing brand at Lakshmana who fell down unconscious.&nbsp; Hanuman again fetched
the hill of herbs to revive Lakshmana.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Ravana is known for his wisdom as well as
for his weakness for woman which may explain why he is pictured as very brainy (ten heads)</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Rama confronts ten-headed Ravana.&nbsp; A
terrible battle ensued between Rama and Ravana.&nbsp; The devas and gandharvas watched
with beating hearts and bated breath.&nbsp; Rama and Ravana let go divine astras, one more
potent than&nbsp; the other.&nbsp; Rama cut off one head of Ravana's after the
other.&nbsp; As he cut off one head, another would rise to take its place and each
succeeding head more efficient than the previous one.&nbsp; Rama was baffled.&nbsp; Ravana
only let out his most hideous laughter as he watched Rama's growing confusion.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Indra sensed Rama's distress and sent down
his own divine chariot and charioteer, Maatali to help him&nbsp; The battle grew more
fierce.&nbsp; Rama and Ravana were both wounded.&nbsp; Rama wounded every limb of Ravana
but he still fought bravely.&nbsp; Streams of blood flowed from his body.&nbsp; In his
last moment he looked proud, haughty and majestic.&nbsp; Maatali whispered in Rama's ear
to use &quot;Agastya's astra&quot; as Ravana's time is up.&nbsp; Rama took the brahmastra
invoked it in the manner which had been prescribed and placed it on the string.&nbsp; When
he did it the earth trembled with fear and all the animals and birds made frightened
noises.&nbsp; Rama pulled the string to his ear and released the great Brahmastra.&nbsp;
With a snake like hiss the astra darted forth and pierced the magnificent wide chest of
Ravana.&nbsp; This was the seat of all his power and strength and is now destroyed by
Rama's burning shaft.&nbsp; Ravana's bow slithered from his dying hands.&nbsp; With a
crash that shook the three worlds he fell down.&nbsp; He face glowed in death.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The vanaras shouted and danced with
joy.&nbsp; The remaing rakshasas were frightened and scattered like scared mice.&nbsp; The
devas showered flowers from heaven and the Sun smiled his warm blessings.&nbsp;
Vibheeshana was moved to tears by the pity he felt for his brother.&nbsp; Rama comforted
him by saying &quot;<b> A hero who dies in the battlefield should not be mourned. He died
a brave death and now shines bright as the Sun in the warriors heaven&quot;&nbsp; </b>Vibheeshana
refused to perform the last rites for Ravana. Rama, the noble, the valiant tells him that,</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>&quot;All enmity ends with death&quot;</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">and that he should perform the funeral rites
for his brother to help him to reach the loka of his pitru's - Lanka mourned and
Vibheeshana was crowned the King of Lanka.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Mandodari, the queen of Ravana the mother of
Indrajit came to the battle field and spoke in a pained voice - &quot;It is not possible
for a man to kill my Lord.&nbsp; I am sure it is Lord Narayana who has killed you.&nbsp;
Because of the blindness of lust, you desired Sita and the death came in the shape of Sita
and she became the cause of your death.&nbsp; You were not defeated by Rama in war but it
was your own sinfulness which has killed you.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Rama sent Hanuman to fetch Sita.&nbsp; Sita
was so happy with relief at the victory of her beloved Lord Rama and wanted to see Rama as
soon as possible.&nbsp; Hanuman wanted to kill all the wicked rakshasis who guarded Sita
but Sita says not to harm them.&nbsp; They are not to blame.&nbsp; They were only obeying
their king.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>One's mercy and compassion should be
available to all. Such is the mark of a noble soul.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">After Sita proves her purity- Rama,
Lakshmana, Sita, Hanuman, Sugreeva &amp; Vibheeshana returned to Ayodhya in Pushpaka
Vimana.&nbsp; Ayodhya was in a frenzy of ecstatic joy.&nbsp; Rama and Bharata met as no
brothers had met before.&nbsp; Tears of happiness were in all eyes.&nbsp; The brothers
prostrated to their Guru Vasishta.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Bharata said to Rama, &quot;Brother, take
back now what always belonged to you-your crown, your people, your kingdom, your
throne.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have faithfully served your sandals these past fourteen years.&nbsp;
Now relieve me of my responsibility.&nbsp; Rama donned the coronation robes.&nbsp; Mother
Sita was dressed beautifully in proper queenly style.&nbsp; She was more beautiful than
ever now, after having endured all the hardships of the forest and suffering at Ravana's
hands (lanka).</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Rama and Sita were seated on the
thrones.&nbsp; Lakshmana was near by.&nbsp; Bharata &amp; Satrugna held the royal white
umbrella behind Rama.&nbsp; Sugreeva &amp; Vibheeshana gently waved the fans.&nbsp; Rama
was crowned king by sage Vasishta.&nbsp; The dream of his Guru, of the queen mothers, of
the loving and devoted brothers and of doting Ayodhyavasis was now fulfilled.&nbsp; Sita
took a pearl necklace and placed it around Hanuman's neck.&nbsp; The humble and devoted
Hanuman clasped the feet of his divine Lord and Lady and in hushed tones of respect he
said,</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;<b>Grant that I shall live down the
ages to listen to your divine story, wherever it is sung by loving and devoted
people.&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Rama smiled and blessed him.&nbsp; Goodness
and virtue had regained their lost crowns.&nbsp; Rama rajya -&nbsp; &quot;an ideal time
when everyone does his or her dharma, an age of supreme contentment, joy and goodness and
where fathers never have to light the funeral pyres for their sons&quot; had taken birth.</font>
