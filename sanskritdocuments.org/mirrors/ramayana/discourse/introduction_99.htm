<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">My pranams to Lord Ramachandra,&nbsp; Guruji
and My dear Satsanghiis,</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">There are 5 accepted philosophies on the
Lord, which are shruti, smruti, puranas, santavani and ithihas.&nbsp; Ramayana and Maha
Bharatha are the ithihasas.&nbsp; This ithihasa is not an imagination of a poet.&nbsp;
Ithi- ha- aasa means, &#147;thus existed once upon a time&#148;, which in this context,
refers to Rama-yana which can be traced back to the 3rd century B.C.&nbsp; Ramayana in
Sanskrit means the &#147;Story of Rama.&#148;&nbsp; It is the first ornate poem of
Valmiki, a contemporary of Lord Rama.&nbsp; It comprises of 7 books and 24,000 shlokas.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">This Rama&#146;s story, is a stream of
sacred sweetness &amp; has been for centuries the perennial source of solace during
sorrow, inspiration in moments of dejection, and guidance while caught in
di-lemma.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is, an intense human drama, where-in god impersonates as man and
gathers around him, on the vast world stage, the perfect and the imperfect, the human and
the sub-human, the beast and the demon, to teach us all by his own example the importance
of this divine human life. It is a story that plays its tender fingers on the heart
strings of man evoking responses of pathos, pity, exultation, adoration, ecstasy and
surrender transforming us from the animal and the human into the divine, which is in our
very core.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Sant Valmiki has given titles to each kanto
as Kaanda.&nbsp; Kaanda means sugarcane. However, crooked the sugarcane maybe, when we
chew on any section, the sweetness is uniform.&nbsp; Similarly Rama&#146;s story, the
stream with many curves and twists flows through sadness, wonder, ridicule, awe, terror,
love, and despair.&nbsp; But the main undercurrent is Dharma:&nbsp; Righteousness.&nbsp;
Here Valmiki by his sheer devotion to the lord and his incomparable poetic imagination
brings into life, Rama, not merely as Dasharatha&#146;s son but as a qualified incarnation
of Vishnu and also as Brahman Him-self. &#147; Yes&#148; The same Brahman, which the vedas
and the upanishads struggle to comprehend and define. And resort to negations &#147;Neti,
Neti&#148;. &#147; Not this, Not this&#148;. .</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The epic play Ramayana opens with
&#147;Balakanda&#148;, wherein childless king Dasharatha performs the Putrakamesti Yagna
and begets 4 children. The day on which Rama, the first child, manifested himself was the
9th day of the shukla paksha of Chaithra masa. Hence this day is celebrated as
&#147;Ramanavami&#148;.&nbsp; Bala Kanda. takes us through different scenes depicting
Dasharatha and his subjects attachment to Rama and his Bala-leelas. Lord Ram shows us
here, of his divine prowess when he weds Sitadevi at the swayamvara, performing a
superhuman feat.&nbsp; This, kaanda will be explained in detail by Vidyaji and Priyaji.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The Balance kaandas are well explained by
the following Shloka, which gives the picture of Ramayana in a nutshell.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>&#147;Aadau Rama Tapovanadi&nbsp; gamanam
, hathva mrugam kaanchanam</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Vaidehi haranam Jatayu maranam Sugreeva
Sambhashanam,</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Vali nirdalanam, samudra taranam lanka puri
daahanam</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Pashchad Ravana Kumbakarna hananam Yettaddi
Ramayanam</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">In the 2nd kaanda, i.e., the
Ayodhyakaanda, we see&nbsp; </font><b><font color="#CC0000">&#147;Aadau Rama Tapovanadi
gamanam&#148;, </font></b><font color="#000000">Rama leaving to the forest on 14 years
exile accompanied by Sita and laxmana, to honor his father&#146;s boon to Kaikeyi. Unable
to bear this separation, the king reaches the heavenly abode.&nbsp; Bharatha on hearing
the events is heartbroken.&nbsp; He rushes to Chitrakuta to placate Rama to return to
Ayodhya.&nbsp; But disappointed, he returns to Ayodhya alone with lord Rama&#146;s
padukas.&nbsp; We shall hear the story in detail from Jaishreeji and Sureshji.</font></font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">In the Aranyakaanda, we see
Shurpanaka&#146;s humiliation &amp; </font><b><font color="#CC0000">&#147;hatva mrugam
kanchanam&#148; </font></b><font color="#000000">the slaying of the illusive golden deer,
followed by &#145;Vaidehi haranam&#148; abduction of sita by Ravana, &amp; </font><b><font
color="#CC0000">&#147;Jatayu maranam&#147; </font></b><font color="#000000">the death of
Jatayu at Ravana&#146;s hands. Rama laments for Sita and is extremely grieved.&nbsp; Here
ends Aranyakaanda,, which will be taken up in detail by Ushaji and Padmaji.</font></font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font color="#000000">Kishkinda Kanda starts with&nbsp; </font><b><font
color="#CC0000">&#147;Sugreeva Sambhashanam,Vali nirdalanam&#148;</font></b><font
color="#000000">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here Rama meets Sugreeva, forges a friendship
with him &amp;&nbsp; kills his brother Vali.&nbsp; Hanuman finds out the location of Sita,
and prepares to take a gigantic leap to Lanka, wherein she is being kept as a prisoner.
This is the gist of Kish Kintha, which will be explained in detail by Devarajanji and
Laxmiji.</font></font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><font color="#CC0000">&#147;Samudra Taranam, Lanka puri
Dahanam&#148;</font></b><font color="#000000">.&nbsp;&nbsp; This forms one of the most
beautiful kaandas, of Ramayana,the Sundara kaanda.&nbsp; Here we get to see the prowess of
Lord Hanuman who takes a mighty leap to Lanka, conveys Lord Rama&#146;s message to Sita
and sets fire to the city of Lanka.&nbsp; He then returns to Rama and narrates the
incidents occurring at Lanka, setting an end to Sundara kaanda which will be dealt by
Soniaji.</font></font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b><font color="#CC0000">&#147;Pashchaad Ravana Kumbarkarana
hananam yettaddi Ramayanam&#148;</font></b><font color="#000000">.&nbsp; We see now the
onset of the last kaanda wherein Lord crosses the ocean, slays Ravana, Kumbakarna and
rescues Sita.&nbsp; Then he returns to Ayodhya after the 14 years and is coronated as the
king.&nbsp; Yuddha kaanda will be dealt by Anandiji and Usha Satyanji.</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Ramayana imparts two lessons:</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>The value of detachment, and the need to
    become aware of the divinity in every being.</b></font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Give up sense objects and you gain Rama.</b></font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">

<p>Sita, gave up the luxuries of Ayodhya and so she could be with Rama in the period
of&nbsp; &#147;exile&#148;.&nbsp; But the moment, she cast longing eyes on the golden deer
and craved for it, she lost the presence of Rama.&nbsp; This clearly depicts that
renunciation brings joy.&nbsp; But attachment brings grief.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Each character in this great epic is a
shining example with its own meaning. <b>Dasharatha </b>even-though is the conqueror of
the ten indriyas, during times of sorrow is swayed by emotions, as a normal man is
susceptible to.&nbsp; This represents being merely physical with the <b>ten senses.</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The <b>three gunas</b> are the <b>three
queens</b>.&nbsp; The <b>four goals</b> of life-the purusharthas are the <b>four sons</b>.&nbsp;
<b>Lakshmana</b> represents the <b>intellect</b>.&nbsp; Sugriva is viveka or
discrimination.&nbsp; <b>Vali is despair.</b> <b>Hanuman</b> is the embodiment of <b>courage
&amp; devotion</b>.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The bridge is built across the ocean of
delusion.&nbsp; The 3 rakhasa chiefs are the personifications of the 3 qualities. <b>Ravana
- Rajasic, Kumbakarna -Thamasic</b> and <b>Vibishana-Satwic</b> qualitiy.&nbsp; Sita is
the BrahmaGYnana or the awareness of the universal truth.&nbsp; The destruction of the <b>ten-headed
Ravana </b>signifies the annihilation of the <b>ten senses.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Devarishi Narada in his Bhakthi Sutras says,</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>&#147;Harer Nama Harer Nama Harer Namaiva
Kevalam Kalau nasthi,</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Yevanasthi Yevansthi,Yeva Gathir
Anyatha&quot;</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">He says that only the name Hari or Rama is
the ultimate refuge in this age of Kali.&nbsp; There is no other way, there is no other
way.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Valmiki , the once notorious bandit could
become a great poet and seer even though he wrongly chanted the name of Lord Rama as
&#147;Mara&#148;.&nbsp; So let us all chant the beautiful name of Srirama and try to cross
this ocean of samsara.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Jag mein sundar hein do naam</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Chaahe Krishna kaho yaa Raam</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Bolo Raam, Raam, Raam.</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Bolo Rama, Raam, Raam.</b></font> </p>
