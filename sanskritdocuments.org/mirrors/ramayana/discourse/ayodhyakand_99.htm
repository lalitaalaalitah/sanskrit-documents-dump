<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The &quot;Ayodhya Kanda&quot; which I will
be talking about is a very important chapter as its the turning point or the knot of&nbsp;
the Ramayana Epic.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Everything is going fine.&nbsp; All four
sons are very well educated, thanks to the two great rishis.&nbsp; Dasaratha, having a
great feeling of pride and happiness in seeing that all his four sons are like&nbsp; four
arms and he was more happy because all these children were born to him when he was no
longer young.&nbsp; Among all the four sons the eldest son Rama was his favorite.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Rama, the great Rama,&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Can we
describe his qualities in words, and that too within this ten minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ramachandra moorthi -&nbsp; Aajanu Baahum, Aravinda dalayata aksham&#133;long and
beautiful arms, handsome, very pleasing, with the face of the charming moon.&nbsp; <b>&quot;
Raakaa&nbsp; chandra samanana Ram&quot;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sri Rama has learnt from their
Kula Guru Vashishta and Viswamitra all the arts like archery, using weapons etc.,&nbsp; In
addition, they taught him all the Vedas and Dharmas.&nbsp; Not only that&#133;Both the
Brahma Rishis taught him the Brahma Vidya - so Sri Ramachandra moorthi is a realized
person - a Brahma vith.&nbsp; He is the one who talks the first - Talk softly - With a
pleasing voice and having never felt the pride of a successful warrior - would never tell
a lie-&nbsp; Help any one who is in need - never felt jealous - never selfish.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Spend his time with learned people and wise elders . Plays Veena -<b> &quot;Akanitha
gunaghana bhooshitha Ram&quot;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; IN SHORT - A PERSON OF ALL GOOD QUALITIES
AND ONLY GOOD OF EVERYTHING&#133; A character who is welcomed everywhere.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">King Dasaratha, who knows all these
qualities <b>(kalyana guna ganangal)</b> thought that Sri Rama is the best fit to rule the
kingdom which was unanimously decided by all his fellow country men and wise
men.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dasaratha thought about an auspicious day, and the very next day was
Pushya. He calls Rama &amp; tells him,&#148; Bharata is away to KaiKeya and this is the
right time for your coronation. I know he loves you &amp; is dedicated to you but</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><u>&nbsp;&quot;Even the minds of those who
follow no other path but that of Dharma, who have been taught all the rules of conduct;
even they, I say, are very rarely happy at the sight of the good fortune which has
befallen to others.&nbsp; The mind of the man is unsteady and so I have decided to hold
the coronation tomorrow&quot;.</u></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Rama spoke no words, but, stood still.&nbsp;
He prostrated once again to his father and left the court.&nbsp; All are happy and there
are joys in every ones heart in Ayodya&#133; Every ONE &#133; No! Except ONE..&nbsp; and
that is the maid Manthara.&nbsp; Being a truthful servant of Kaikeyie She&nbsp; says that
only Kaikeye 's son Bharatha is to be crowned as yuvaraja and to keep complications away
Rama has to be exiled to forest. She poisons the mind of Kaikeye &amp; Kaikeye acts
exactly as told by manthara.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Kaikeyee reminded Dasaratha of the two boons
- which she has earned for doing the service to Dasaratha - when he&nbsp; fought against
Sambara asura - on the request of Indra.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Dasaratha becomes helpless and bounded by
his promise.&nbsp; Rama, who does&nbsp; <b>&quot;pithurvakya paripalana says&quot;&nbsp;</b>
I have made up my mind to obey my father, since, to me, it is the ultimate Dharma&quot;.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Unperturbed as he always by pleasure or
pain, happiness or sorrow, by the sway of the opposites, Rama stood calm.&nbsp; There was
not even a trace of disappointment or anger in his face.&nbsp; Infact, Kambar in his
Ramayana describe the face of sri Rama as <b>&quot;andralanrnda Thamraiyai
Vendrathamma&quot;</b>,&nbsp; meaning that Sri Rama's face was beautiful, much beautiful
than a fresh lotus flower which was blossomed on that day.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">It was decided after great debate, Lakshmana
and Sita devi would accompany him to the forest.&nbsp; It was Sita who convinced Rama that
she should accompany him.&nbsp; &quot;A Pativratha, if she is separated from her husband,
is not fit to be alive&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In the case of Lakshmana Mentally Rama had
already decided to take Lakshmana with him as both of them were inseperable from
childhood.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In this important Kanda, we learn many
things.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Firstly the picture of a perfect
person</u></i></b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Sri Rama, having born as a human being, has
lived an example life by demonstrating the way to live - as it was mentioned in Sri Bagwad
Gita, where God says &quot; that &quot; Naran&quot; who treats the honor and dishonour,
cold and heat, pleasure and pain and who is free from attachments, is very dearer to
me&quot; <b>(tulya ninda stutor mouni, santhushto yena kena chit!! Aniketha Siramathi
Bhaktimanyo Prio Naraha!!).</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In the present world we only come across&nbsp;
JACK OF ALL TRADES BUT &#133;,</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Secondly moha is the cause of all
grief</u></i></b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">King Dasaratha, loved his youngest queen
Kaikeyee, until the time she was doing things which were pleasing to him.&nbsp; But, once
she mentioned something against him, then, he started hating her totally.&nbsp; This mind
of Dasaratha reflects that even though he has learnt Dharma and others, he is not able to
practice, when it comes to his own actions.&nbsp; Love - Too&nbsp; much love on
everything-causes great grief --.&nbsp; <b>(Aasaithaan Azivirku Kaaranam.....?)</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Thirdly about Prarabhda.</u></i></b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Prarabdha meaning - the fruits of the
actions of the past.&nbsp; King Dasratha had a curse that he has to suffer the separation
of his son, since, he by mistake killed the one &amp; only son of an aged and disabled
parents. So, it is evident that the past actions will have some effect in the current
birth, and one must have to undergo the results of the past actions.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Fourthly the lesson from Sumithra ,
Lakshmana's mother.</u></i></b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Sumithra blesses Lakshmana&nbsp; and asks
him to always serve his elder brother. This reminds us of the ancient rule: Serving those
who are elders is the surest path to heaven.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Fifthly the lesson of Universal
brotherhood&nbsp; and acceptability of individual human</u></i></b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Rama always considered all his four brothers
to be equal. He had a very broad minded outlook that gained him very good friends.&nbsp;
No. More than friends.. Good brothers&#133; When he met Guhan who helps him crossing the
Ganga river&nbsp; Kambar mentions that <b>&quot;Guganodu Aivaranoom&quot;&nbsp;</b>
meaning,&nbsp; with the introduction of Guha, the four brothers became five brothers. This
is a good example of how successful a person can become if he accepts his brothers and
united they be, unlike Mahabaratha where king Duriodana loses all his brothers since he
fought against his own cousin brothers.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Finally we learn that never a
person should never act against his or her true nature.</u></i></b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">If only Kaikeye&nbsp; never got influenced
by the wrong preaching of manthara, if she had acted as per her inner self she would have
never become a sinner.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">I end my speech here and suresh will tell us
about the other chapters of Ayodhya kanta.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Sri Rama Jayam</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#009900" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Mr.Suresh</u></i></b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Rama is extremely grieved at the calamities that have struck
in short period of time.&nbsp; &#147;I feel that Kama is more powerful than Dharma, Artha
and Moksha.&nbsp; Otherwise how could the king have banished me to the forest.&nbsp; Rama
expresses fear that the king who has sacrificed his Dharma and Artha because of his Kama
may leave them soon.&nbsp; Rama expresses&nbsp; that it may be due to the karma of
Kausalya in her previous births that she is suffering separation from his son at her old
age.&nbsp; Rama was shedding tears at the thought of his father and mother and the
happenings in Ayodhya.&nbsp; He also suggests Lakshmana that he should return back to
Ayodhya and take care of the mothers and the king from any more evil that may be caused by
kaikeyi.&nbsp; Lakshmana declares that he cannot live without Rama for a single amount and
says he doesn&#146;t even wish that heaven which doesn&#146;t have Rama there.&nbsp; Rama
is pleased and he says that Lakshmana I need you&nbsp; by my side in the same way as you
need me.&nbsp; Thus they spend the night.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the morning they continue their journey into the Dandaka
Forest and reach the Ashrama of sage Bharadwaja.&nbsp; Sage Bharadwaja is able to
recognise with his inner eye who Rama actually is.&nbsp; Rama briefly narrates to the sage
about the incidents that had happened and the need for his Vanavasa.&nbsp; The sage is
pleased with Rama&#146;s visit.&nbsp; He offers to Rama to spend his Vanavasa in the Sages
Ashrama itself.&nbsp; Rama humbly denies stating that since the Ashrama is very near to
the city lot of people from the city may come to see them which would disturb the serenity
and peace of the Ashrama.&nbsp; Bharadwaja realises this and directs Rama to a hill called
Chitrakuta to spend his Vanavasa.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Rama starts on his trip to Chitrakuta.&nbsp; The forest is
extremely beautiful with variety of flowers, the fragrances generated by them, pleasant
sounds from the running of the river and the noises made by various birds and
animals.&nbsp; They reach Chitrakuta and Rama locates a place in the hill for them to
build their hermitage.&nbsp; Lakshmana builds a beautiful hut for them and Rama performs
the Vastu Shanti rites for entering into a new house by offering the flesh of deer to the
god of Fire.&nbsp; The place had abundant food, the river Malyavati was flowing near their
Ashrama the natural beauty wad heart rending and they were enjoying their time in the
forest not even a trace of sorrow in them of sacrificing the pleasures in the city.&nbsp;
Such was the beauty of Chitrakuta.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sumantra returns back to Ayodhya to see the city in a sorrow
struck state.&nbsp; He rushes to see the King who is waiting for Sumantra to return.&nbsp;
Sumantra explains to the King in detail about the incidents till he left Rama.&nbsp;
Dasarata faints in between and asks Sumantra various questions about How Rama walked on
the hard ground , What did he tell me before he left and a series of questions.&nbsp; He
asks to Sumantra to talk about Rama which could only bring a semblance of peace to
him.&nbsp; The King is broken and his queen Kausalya tries to console him.&nbsp; There is
no enemy worse than sorrow since it has the power to completely destroy all the good
qualities in a man.&nbsp; When your enemies hurt you can show your valour by fighting back
with them.&nbsp; But when the gods will that certain events should take place one cannot
alter the course of fate.&nbsp; Saying thus Kausalya tries to console the King.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The king now tells the queen of an incident where by he
unknowingly killed an young ascetic boy whose parents were blind.&nbsp; Then the parents
curse the king that his death would come as a result of separation from his son.&nbsp;
That night Dasaratha dies in his sleep.&nbsp; The king lived for five nights after Rama
left and when he learnt that Rama would now return only after a long span of fourteen
years his heart cracked and unknowingly he died.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ministers and the Guru Vasishta decide upon the next
course of action, which is to bring Bharata and Shatrughna from their vacation to their
Grandfather&#146;s home in the country Kekaya. Vashishta advises the messengers that they
should not utter anything regarding the happenings in the country, since the death of the
King was not officially declared then.&nbsp; Hence they go along with the routine gifts
that are take to greet a king by another.&nbsp; The messengers go and submit to Bharata
about the summon from the Guru Vashishta.&nbsp; Bharata who is scared of the bad dreams
that he had , enquires about the welfare of each and every one of his kins in Ayodhya to
which the messengers tactfully answer without disclosing anything.&nbsp; Bharata starts to
Ayodhya and is deeply concerned of the bad omens that he comes across during his trip.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As soon as he reaches Ayodhya he runs to the Kings palace to
meet his father.&nbsp; The king is absent in his palace.&nbsp; He immediately thinks that
the king must be in the palace of Kaikeyi.&nbsp; Such was the love the king had for
Kaikeyi.&nbsp; Without a second thought he rushes to Kaikeyis palace.&nbsp; He is even
more concerned there by noticing his mothers palace which is without its usual
decorations.&nbsp; He enquires his mother about the whereabouts of his father.&nbsp;
Kaikeyi declares to Bharata that the king has attained that state which all living beings
should attain one day.&nbsp; Bharata is shocked by the suddenness with which it was told
and he recovers after a while and starts grieving about his misfortune to have missed his
father during his end.&nbsp; He says Rama is the most fortunate one who must have stayed
near the king at the time of his death.&nbsp; Now he asks what did my father spoke before
he died what was he thinking.&nbsp; Kaiakeyi replies that the king spoke three names Rama
Lakshmana and Sita.&nbsp; He uttered only one sentence.&nbsp; Fortunate will be the people
who will see Rama that Handsome son of mine with Sita and Lakshmana returning&nbsp; to
Ayodhya.&nbsp; Bharata is surprised to see that Rama was not there when the king
died.&nbsp; Also he feels strange about the absence of Sita even if Lakshmana had gone
along with Rama.&nbsp; He is asking Kaikeyi about this, when Kaikeyi without realising the
misfortune that had fallen on her explains to him in detail about what happened in his
absence that lead to the death of the King.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bharata is not able to grasp the what Kaikeyi had told
him.&nbsp; He is not able to withstand the shock and faints.&nbsp; It is said here that
the Nature which is ever kind allowed him a respite of few moments by letting him
faint.&nbsp; When he recovers he is so angry and the hatred he has towards Kaikeyi is
explained by the way he addresses her.&nbsp; He addresses her as woman instead of calling
her mother.&nbsp; I will willingly kill you myself and the reason why I am not doing it is
because then Rama will not look at me and would attribute to me the sin of killing ones
mother.&nbsp; He asks Kaikeyi what wrong did I do to you for you to have brought such an
infamy to you.&nbsp; How could you do this to Rama who loved you so much Mother Kausalya
was treating you as her loving sister.&nbsp; How could you do this to her.&nbsp; How could
you think even for a moment that I would accept the kingdom, with my father dead and
brother banished to forest did you think I would dare to sit on the throne that was graced
by my father.&nbsp; I would rather die than contemplate such s sinful act.&nbsp; Your
father is such a noble man.&nbsp; Flawless is your ancestry ?&nbsp; How could such a
daughter be born to that Great man.&nbsp; I will this very moment go to the forest and
bring back my beloved brother and make him the king and serve him for my rest of the life.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bharata then goes to see the ministers and the queens
explains and pleads them of his innocence.&nbsp; He declares to them his intentions of
going into the forest to bring back Rama and asks the necessary arrangements to be
made.&nbsp; He performs the last rites for his father and he broke down while performing
the rituals.&nbsp; Guru Vasishta now explains to Bharata about the nature of this
life.&nbsp; Three pairs visit every man they are hunger and thirst, sorrow and delusion,
birth and death.&nbsp; A man cannot escape unless he realises that these are transient and
inevitable.&nbsp; If a man is prepared for them and tackle them properly then they will
fail to take firm hold of his power of thinking.&nbsp; Man should realise that the world
is characteristic of these and similar opposites and life is an eternal warfare between
these and intelligence which should be prepared to subdue whenever they threaten to gain
ascendancy.&nbsp; A man who is born has to die and that is the law of nature.&nbsp; It is
true that the king died under tragic circumstances but no one can alter the course of
fate.&nbsp; Then Bharata performs the last rites for the father.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bharata and Shatrughna come across Manthra and she is
pointed out to the princes as the root cause of all the calamities.&nbsp; Shatrughna
decides to treat her royally.&nbsp; However Bharata intervenes and saves Mantara by saying
that we should what Rama would have done now.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now all the ministers gather and they explain to Bharata the
dangers for a kingdom without the King and since Bharata is the heir apparent now he has
to take up the kingdom.&nbsp; Bharata firmly refuses I do not approve of this sinful act
of my mother and states his decision to go into the forest and try to bring Rama if
possible otherwise I will replace Rama in the forest instead and Rama will comeback to
rule the country.&nbsp; Vashishta admires his young pupil who seemed as great as if not
greater than Rama in adhering to Dharma.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bharata with all his mothers and the entire army proceed to
the forest.&nbsp; They meet Guha on the Way.&nbsp; Guha is concerned about the intentions
of Bharata only to know the greatness of Bharata and helps him to cross the river
Ganges.&nbsp; Bharata now reaches the Ashrama of Bharadwaja.&nbsp; The sage is delighted
by the Dharma these noble men are following.&nbsp; He the directs Bharata to Chitrakuta as
he did for Rama.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Rama and his team is having a pleasant stay in&nbsp;
Chitrakuta.&nbsp; Suddenly they are amused by the panic created among the animals and the
shock felt in the ground.&nbsp; Rama thinks that some prince is coming into the forest for
hunting.&nbsp; He asks Lakshmana to find out what is happening.&nbsp; Lakshmana is angry
at seeing the army that is coming under the flag of Ayodhya.&nbsp; He thinks that Bharata
is coming to destroy them.&nbsp; Hearing this Rama becomes extremely happy and explains
Lakshmana about the greatness of Bharata.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bharata finally reaches the residence of Rama in
Chitrakuta.&nbsp; He is not able to express his feelings&nbsp; and falls in the feet of
Rama.&nbsp; Rama is also taken aback by the sight of Bharata dressed in treebark with
matted hair and had grown thin beyond recognition.&nbsp; Bharata tells Rama about the
happenings after he left.&nbsp; Rama is sorrow struck knowing the death of
Dasaratha.&nbsp; Rama performs the final rituals for the deceased king.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Bharata appeals to Rama to come back to the country.&nbsp;
You have always granted the wishes of every one.&nbsp; It is up to you keep up your
reputation.&nbsp; Rama says fathers have every right to command their sons to act
according to their wish and this applies to their wives also.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bharatha
now recasts his words and ofofers the kingdom at the feet of Rama and pleads him to take
it.&nbsp; Rama is unmoved and he has no intentions of returning back.&nbsp; Barata reminds
of the duty of Kshatriya to protect his subjects.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">He gives a lenghty talk to Bharata about the impermanence of
life limitied by space and time.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Man delights at the sight of sun rise and again when the sun
sets Seldom he realises that it has eaten away a day of his life.&nbsp; There are various
seasons in a year, which frequently change.&nbsp; Each season has its own
speciality.&nbsp; Whilst these seasons are enjoyable in a variety of ways one has to
realise that these take away large slices of one's life.&nbsp; The night which passes will
never come back.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Men become old, their skin gets wrinkled and they lose their
power of thinking and death claims them.&nbsp; Death walks with us in the longest journey
of&nbsp; life which we undertake.&nbsp; Your life and mine are eaten away by time.&nbsp;
So do not waste your time by contemplating on anothers life.&nbsp; Think of the
Lord.&nbsp; Our father has shed his old and serene body and is now in the
Brahmaloka.&nbsp; It is not correct for us to grieve over his death.&nbsp; It is our duty
to fulfill his last words and save him from not becoming an Adharmi.&nbsp; Saying thus
Rama tries to console Bharata and also firmly reiterates his stand that he will not return
before the end of his vanavasa.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The ministers and the Guru try to persuade Rama and they all
realise that it is impossible to do that. They also convince Bharata.&nbsp; Bharata then
says &quot; you have commandned me.&nbsp; You are my father now and I should do what you
ask me to do.&nbsp; But one thing is certain I will not accept the kingdom for
myself.&nbsp; Then Bharata takes Rama's Sandals and says, &quot;These sandals will take
the burden of ruling the world.&nbsp; They will rule the kingdom as your symbols and I
will by your representative.&nbsp; Till you come back I will live thus wearing tree bark
and deer skin living outside Ayodhya eating fruits and roots.&nbsp; Then after the
vanavasa is over if I don't see you then I will ennter the fire and end my life&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then they all return back to Ayodhya and Bharata starts
residing in a place outside Ayodhya called Nandhigrama and starts ruling as a
representative of Rama.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Here ends Ayodhya Kanda.</font> </p>
