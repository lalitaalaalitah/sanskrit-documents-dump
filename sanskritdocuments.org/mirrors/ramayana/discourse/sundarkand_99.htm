<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">My obesciences to the Master, to the guru,
and to all of you,&nbsp; fortunate, blessed devotees assembled here this
evening.&nbsp; From time&nbsp; immemorial, the Lord has descended in various
forms, to uphold dharma,&nbsp; and set things right. From amongst these
innumerable avatars, one of the&nbsp; most well known, and best loved,
is the Ramayanam. Last Thursday and&nbsp; Saturday, we have listened to
a lot about the Ramayana, today, we will&nbsp; listen to the Sundarakandam,
which is the crust of the Ramayana, it is&nbsp; the ornament of the entire
epic, it is a mine of spiritual inspiration.&nbsp; We have already been
introduced to the monkey bhakta, Hanumanji, today&nbsp; we will listen
to how he croses the ocean, and reached Lanka.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">So the task of reaching Lanka and finding
out if Sita was captured&nbsp; there, was finally given to our Hanumanji.&nbsp;
He was on a mountain top, he&nbsp; had to leap from there, across the ocean,
and reached&nbsp; Lanka. He looked&nbsp; like a wild bull, he was enormous,
and all the creatures on the mountain&nbsp; were absolutely petrified,
they shuddered under him. Hanumanji, on the&nbsp; mountain top, saluted
to all the Gods, he turned to the east and saluted to his father Vayu,
and paid obeisciences to his master, Rama, and&nbsp; Lakshmana, and then
to the seas and rivers.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">He then further enlarged in size, to the
maximum, and he had made up&nbsp; his mind, he will get Sita by hook or
crook, some how or the other, if&nbsp; he couldn&#146;t find her, he would get
the entire city of Lanka with him. He&nbsp; was so determined, because
it was his master&#146;s command that he go in the&nbsp; quest of Sitaji and
succeed.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Praphupad, the founder acharya of ISKCON&nbsp;
was told by his guru, only once, &#145;Abhay, if you ever get money, publish&nbsp;
books&#146;.&nbsp;&nbsp; In his late 60s, with Rs.40 in his pocket, he decided
to leave&nbsp; to the US and fulfill this command of the Guru. This is
how it should be, the Guru&#146;s wish should be our command.</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">So our hanumanji, then confidently leapt,
he looked like the moon in a clouded sky, and he was flying the king of
the ocean told the mountain Mainaka to grow larger, so that hanumanji could
rest on him. And the mountain grew. Hanumanji first thought the mountain
to be an obstacle, but then when he found out why it had risen, he said,
kindly,&nbsp; &#145;No. Thanks a lot for your affection for Ramji, but I can
not rest till I&nbsp; have accomplished what I have undertaken.&#146; So he
went on , and all the devas in the sky wanted to see how strong he was
in his will, so they told the mother of serpents to assume the shape of
a big rakshasi, and&nbsp; she did. She wouldn&#146;t let Hanumanji go, and said,&nbsp;
&#145;If you want to go, you have to enter my month and be my khaanna.&#146;&nbsp;
And Hanumanji said I am going on a very important mission, please could
I be your food on the way back, and she refused. So our Hanumanji&nbsp;
said alright, open your mouth wide enough to accommodate me, and he grew
and grew and grew in size, and her mouth&nbsp; widened and widened and
widened in size. Then he shrunk to the size of a&nbsp; thumb, entered and
came out in a moment. And the mother was happy, she said,&nbsp; &quot; may you
succeed my child .&quot;&nbsp; He faced more obstacles, but there was the grace
of the guru, there was the love for the Lord, there was the determination,
there was the shraddha, and who can stop such a person?&nbsp; So he went
on covered the 100 yojanas, and reached the other shore.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hanuman
had achieved that which had seemed impossible. He could see Lanka now.&nbsp;
It was a beautiful city, lovely mansions, beautiful gardens every where,
everything decorated with the most precious of jewels, but unfortunately,
the city was guarded by Ravana&#146;s demons, and now Hanumanji&nbsp; had to
think of a plan. How could he cross them? If he tried to get into a fight,
and if he lost, then his whole travel would be futile, and Ramji would
have to return to Ayodhya without Sita.&nbsp; So he waited till it was
dark.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The entire city was protected by a very high
wall.&nbsp; He was trying to enter the city when the guardian of the city,
a goddess, came to him.&nbsp; She asked him,&nbsp; &#145;What do you want, haan?&nbsp;
You seem to be a monkey! Tell me&nbsp; the truth, or I&#146;m going to kill
you.&#146;&nbsp; Hanumanji tried to talk humbly, &#145;I&#146;ve&nbsp; come to admire
this lovely city&#146;, but this Lankini, as was her name,&nbsp; would now come
down to earth, &#145;You stupid monkey&#146;, she said. Now our Hanumanji&nbsp; also
got angry, so he punched her hard, and she fell, but not that hard,&nbsp;
because she was a woman.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">5000 yrs back they had regard for woman,
but&nbsp; anyone, you can&#146;t expect traditions and values to last that long,
because we are now entering the 21st century.</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now Lankini was&nbsp; humiliated, and she
said, &#145;Brahmaji had given me a boon. He said when a&nbsp; monkey conquers
you, you must realize that the end of the Rakshasas has&nbsp; come. I always,
wanted to meet the Lord, but I was unfotunate enough to&nbsp; have taken
birth in the Rakshasa clan, but today, I have seen the Lord&#146;s&nbsp; direct
devotee, I am so immensely blessed, I need nothing more, I can&nbsp; now
happily breathe my end.&#146;, so she lets him enter, knowing that he had&nbsp;
come to rescue Sita.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotten rid of the angel guardian of Lanka,
Hanumanji jumped the high wall,&nbsp; and entered the city.&nbsp; It was
beautiful, decorated with pearls and&nbsp; flowers, soft music playing
in the background, beautiful to view, but it was amusing to watch the guards,
most of them totally intoxicated,&nbsp; drugged asleep, with gorgeous women
giving them company. Not very&nbsp; different from what we see nowadays.
He looked at all their faces, and&nbsp; he said, &#145;Oh God! These definitely
can&#146;t be Sitaji. She is the most&nbsp; beautiful of women, she must be
somewhere else.&#146; He then enters Ravana&#146;s&nbsp; palace, it seemed to be
the ornament of the entire city, shining&nbsp; brilliance, from the precious
stones and 24 carat gold that it was made&nbsp; out of. He was amazed at
the prosperity that he saw there, there were&nbsp; thousands of beautiful
women sleeping there, but he scanned their faces&nbsp; and he was sure
none of them was Sita.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a separate tejas, a glow&nbsp;
on a person who thinks of the Lord constantly. The person need not be&nbsp;
beautiful, but you can say from the very glimpse of the person&#146;s face &#150;&nbsp;
this person is a bhakta.</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">These were women all brought, or let say,
won&nbsp; by Ravana, in many of his fights, and all of them were really
light&nbsp; headed, so more than him, they were in love with all that he
offered&nbsp; them, so many women, yet Ravana had to bring his end closer
by capturing&nbsp; Sita.</font>
<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the height of foolishness, the
more we have the more we&nbsp; want, but this fool had gone upto the extent
of actually separating the&nbsp; Lord from his consort. You think of troubling
a Bhakta and the Lord gets&nbsp; furious, here this devil had captured
a Bhakta, was torturing a bhakta,&nbsp; so he definitely could not have
a very comfortable end.</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hanumanji goes wandering around, and he finally
sees an amazing cot, made of&nbsp; crystal, ivory, sandal and gold, unbelievably
beautiful, and in it slept&nbsp; Ravana, looking mighty, very handsome,
very healthy, arrogance and pride&nbsp; written and glued onto his face,
clad in the best of clothing, adorned&nbsp; in the best of jewelry. And
as he goes on, he sees another beautiful&nbsp; cot, separate from Ravana&#146;s
and the other womens&#146; and in it slept an&nbsp; amazing woman, so beautiful,
that there was no need of jewels to enhance&nbsp; her beauty. Hanumanji
thought he had found Sita, and he starting clapping and&nbsp; jumping in
joy, when it struck him, that how can this be sita? That&nbsp; noble lady
will not sleep, parted from her Lord, she will not eat, and&nbsp; yes,
that woman was not Sita.&nbsp; It was Mandodari, the wife of Ravana.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now Hanumanji wonders, where can she be? I HAVE to find her! Then he saw
an&nbsp; ashokavana nearby, and he thought he must go there and search.
It was a&nbsp; lovely garden, favourite of the king, because it was maintained
with&nbsp;&nbsp; great care. Trees, flowers, fruits, birds and delicate
animals of every&nbsp; kind, every breed, sheltered there. Rama had once
told Hanumanji that Sita was&nbsp; very fond of trees, so he was positive
to find her there. As he went on,&nbsp; he suddenly saw a woman was like
the thin crescent at the beginning of&nbsp; the brighter fortnight. She
was very thin, and it was&nbsp; conspicuous that&nbsp; she had been fasting
endlessly. She was amazingly gorgeous, draped in a&nbsp; crumpled piece
of silk, yellow in color, covered by dust, no jewellery,&nbsp; and she
looked very sad, and scarred.&nbsp; There were many Rakshasis around her,
and she was helpless and lonely, her hair twisted into a single&nbsp; strand,
very long like a black snake. It was Her, it was Sita.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">There was suddenly a lot of commotion, there
was the sound of powerful strides, and the magnificent Ravana made his
way to the spot where Sita was seated. Seeing him, the delicate lady started
shrinking into herself, unable to bear the piercing looks of the king,
who was drenched in greed, lust and every demonic quality one could think
of. And he started speaking to her, &#145;see, you are so beautiful, and I love
you so&nbsp; whole-heartedly, why don&#146;t you marry me?&nbsp; Why not become
mine? I love you so intensely, that I am not even forcing you to do anything,
I am giving you your own time. You can rule as my queen, you don&#146;t look
good like this, absolutely mariyal, I&#146;ll dress you in the best of clothing
you have ever seen! So what are you waiting for?&#146; Sita is distressed, shocked
to see such a person! And she tells him, &#145;See, go away! Don&#146;t&nbsp; think
of anything so sinful. You are only giving death a VIP inviting. You are
supposed to be a king, so protect the dharma handed down by your&nbsp;
elders, I am a married woman, I can not marry you. My Lord is ever&nbsp;
merciful, even now it is not too late, take me back to him, and he will&nbsp;
forgive you,&#146;</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Ravana&#146;s wild, he had to be pacified, and
he charged out of there. The Rakshasis then start harassing her, and she
is crying and crying and crying, not knowing what to do, and Hanumanji
is seeing all this.&nbsp; And he is wondering, now how do I go down and
talk to her, she&#146;ll&nbsp; probably start screaming at my very site. Hanumanji
was best known for his&nbsp; speech, so he decided to start reciting something
love, and he began, &#145;There was a great king known as Dhasharatha, who had
4 equally great sons, the eldest of whom was called Rama. Very dear to
the king, the protector of dharma, on being told by his old father, Rama
agreed to go to the forest, for 14 yrs. He was accompanied by his wife
and brother.&nbsp; Then Sita, his pious wife, got kidnapped by ravana,
and Ram made friends with a monkey king, who agreed to help find Sita.
He sent his monkeys all over, I am one of them. An eagle guided me to this
place, and I crossed the ocean, and came to Lanka. Sita who has been described
to me by Rama has been seen by me.&#146; And she felt scarred, who is this?
She looks up, and she sees the little Hamnumanji on the tree.&nbsp; She
agrees, &#145;yes, yes, you definitely must be my Lord&#146;s messenger&#146;, and&nbsp;
asks him to tell her about Rama. Picture it, pls, the Lord&#146;s consort, and
the Bhakta are talking about the Lord.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">What a site! Hanumanji tells her&nbsp; about
how they came, how they saw her jewels, and about his leaping&nbsp; across
the sea, and he stood, palms folded, and told her that Rama and&nbsp; Lakshmana
are well, and gave her Rama&#146;s ring. And then the mother looks&nbsp; at
the ring, and tears drip from her eyes at the thought of her beloved, and
she tells Hanumanji,&nbsp; &#145;You are so great, to have the grace of my Lord,
and&nbsp; cross the ocean. My Lord and Lakshmana are well, I am happy,
but have I not suffered enough? Why has he yet not come?&#146; and Hanumanji
says,&nbsp; &#145;If Rama knew where you were, he would have come immediately,
but he didn&#146;t!&nbsp; So he sent me to find out, but now he&#146;ll come.&#146;&nbsp;
Look at the tolerance of&nbsp; this bhakta. Sita is thrilled, but Hanumanji
can&#146;t bear the thought of leaving her in the Ashokavana all alone, so he
says, &#145;I can change my size to anything suitable.&nbsp; Would you like
me to carry you out of here, to Rama?&#146; And Sitaji says, &#145;No, that will
not be a credit to Rama.&nbsp; I will remain till he himself comes and
rescues me.&#146; Hanumanji is thrilled to see the courage of the woman enduring
such insufferable torture, and since he has to leave, he wants to know
if she has any message for Rama.&#146;</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And the mother spoke with tears in her eyes,
full of tears, she tells Hanuman to repeat just what she says to Rama.
And she says, &#145;Once, on the hill Chitrakuta, on the banks of the river
Mandakini, a crow came in our presence, you were lying down on my lap,
and the crow was bent on eating flesh and he kept piercing me with his
sharp beak. I got annoyed, and you looked at my face and laughed at me.
You slept on. Later, the crow came back from nowhere, and this time he
started piercing me more fiercely, and there were drops of blood falling
from my flesh. You got so annoyed, that you were about to kill the crow,
and you were about to invoke the Brahmastra.&nbsp; Lord, when you could
not bear a crow piercing me, how is it that you are bearing me being&nbsp;
captured and tortured by a demon? Am I such a sinner to stay away from
you for so long? Why don&#146;t you free me from here, Lord?&#146; And she tells
Hanumanji,&nbsp; &#145;Convey my prostrations to Rama, my blessings to Lakshmana.&#146;
Wiping her eyes, she then gives Hanumanji the chudamani jewel worn in her
hair, which she was given during her wedding, and tells him to give it
to Rama. She then tells Hanumanji to go safely, because her safety depends
on him, and she is still unwilling to let him go, because his coming was
source of comfort to her. She says, &#145;My Lord would be so heart broken to
stay away from me, how is he carrying on? Give him my jewel, it will make
him feel better, remind him of the playful moments we had together. Once
when my tilak was not perfectly in shape, he took the dust from the ground,
and he put it on my cheek.&nbsp; Remind him of that, he&#146;ll feel better.&#146;</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">And then Hanumanji takes her blessings, and
he is ready to leave, when he thinks, that it really is not right to leave,
without even meeting Ravana, talking to him, and getting him acquainted
to the power of Rama&nbsp; and his devotees. So he decides, &#145;How can I
fight with the Rakshasas?&#146;&nbsp; Then he decides to destroy the Ashokavana,
slowly, slowly, since that&nbsp; was Ravana&#146;s favorite garden. So he starts
uprooting trees, and slowly&nbsp; everything is gone, and there is chaos,
and Ravana is informed. He sends&nbsp; his entire army, they are defeated,
he sends his minister&#146;s son, he is killed, he then sends his own son, even
he is killed, then he decides to&nbsp; send Indrajit, his favourite, and
most valiant son. Indrajit is there, and the fight is really worth watching,
better than any WWF match you&nbsp; would have ever watched, both so mighty,
so powerful, none of Indrajit&#146;s&nbsp; most powerful arrows also hurt the
monkey, they all prove futile.&nbsp; Finally, he invoke the Brahmasthra,
which ties up Hanumanji, and Hanumanji can do&nbsp; anything, but he doesn&#146;t
want to get out of it, because he wants to meet&nbsp; Ravana, so he is
tied up tight, bound well, and taken to Ravana&#146;s court.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hanumanji is absolutely spell bound.&nbsp;
He sees the Rakshasa king very a&nbsp; beautifully made golden crown set
with gems and pearl. He was wearing&nbsp; ornaments made of gold, and was
wearing the softest of white silks. There was sandal wood smell in the
durbar, it was amazing, and Hanumanji was&nbsp; standing with his mouth
open at this great king. He looked so good, yet,&nbsp; it was a pity that
he had committed a sin of capturing the eternal consort of the Lord, because
the Lord is&nbsp; definitely not going to spare&nbsp; him for that. Finally
Ravana asks his manthri to ask Hanuman&nbsp; why he has come.&nbsp; Why
has he ruined the garden? What is his purpose? And Hanumanji talks directly
to the king, he says, I am Rama&#146;s messenger, and I&#146;ve come to&nbsp; talk
to you, to tell you to change your ways, do not even think of&nbsp; making
Sitaji yours, she&#146;s like a small flame, that can rise any time and destroy
your entire city.&nbsp; Ravana is furious, he says, &#145;Kill this&nbsp; monkey!&#146;
And his brother, Vibhishana, who happens to be a good and&nbsp; righteous,
unusual Rakshasa, he tells him, &#145;bhaiya, it is not right to kill a messenger.
If you want, kill the princes, Rama and Lakshmana, but&nbsp; killing a
messenger will be considered an act of cowards.&#146;&nbsp; Finally,&nbsp; Ravana
agrees, but he says, &#145;Now, I am not going to let this monkey&nbsp; escape
so easily. He has to suffer. The dearest possession of a monkey&nbsp; is
his tail, and I&#146;ll set fire to his tail, and teach a lesson to all&nbsp;
the other monkeys also.&#146;</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">So, there, the rakshasas has tied a cloth
around Hanumanjis tail, and they&nbsp; set fire to it. They then drag him
all around Lanka, and Hanumanjis very&nbsp; glad, because even he wants
to see this Lanka. And Sitaji hears of Hanumanjis fate, and she&#146;s in tears.
She invokes Agni bhagawan in her mind and&nbsp; tells him, &#145;If I am a pure
woman who has served my Lord faithfully, pls&nbsp; don&#146;t let Hanumanji
feel the heat&#146;, and not doubt, though his tail was&nbsp; burning, Hanumanji
felt a coolness, like sandal paste had been applied on it.&#146;&nbsp; Look
at the power of true prayer.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Finally Hanumanji decided that he had seen
enough of lanka, and he then&nbsp; started enlarging in size, he drove
away all the Rakshasas with his enormous tail, and he went about setting
fire to the whole city, and the Rakshasas are absolutely zapped. Hanumanji
then reached the sea shore, and he&nbsp; dipped his burning tail into the
water and extinguished the fire. He was&nbsp; positive that Sitaji was
safe, unhurt, and with confidence, he went to&nbsp; the top of the hill
Srishta, and leapt high. Again, he flew the&nbsp; distance, crossed the
ocean, and gave a very triumphant roar as he was&nbsp; landing, so all
the other vanaras also knew that their hero was back.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">All the vanaras are jumping, they are absolutely
delighted, giving Hanumanji&nbsp; an absolutely VVVVIP treatment. And he
tells them of his entire trip,&nbsp; all that has happened, all that he
saw, and the monkeys decide that they&nbsp; must definitely now go and
get Sita, but they decide that they must&nbsp; first go to Kishkinda, and
tell Rama about Hanumanjis trip, and that Sitaji&nbsp; has been found.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Each of them went, triumphant, to Sugriva&#146;s
court, absolutely&nbsp; delighted. And Rama and Lakshmana are mad with
joy, on hearing that&nbsp; Sitaji has been found. And Hanumanji conveys
Sitaji&#146;s message, &#145;Lord, only 1&nbsp; month more for me to survive, pls
come here and save me before that&nbsp; month expires!&#146;&nbsp; He sees the
chudamani jewel, and he is in tears, not&nbsp; able to believe that he
has stayed from so long without Sita. The vanaras then decide that we just
have to go to Lanka, and a bridge has&nbsp; to be built, across the ocean,
so that our entire army may reach Lanka.</font>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Although the Sundarakandam might sound like
a mere narrative, it is&nbsp; not! There is a lot of hidden meaning in
the entire story.</font>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is a&nbsp; reflection of the awakened
spiritual seeker, in search of the divinity within him.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hanumanji here portrays the awakened spiritual
seeker;</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The&nbsp; crossing of the ocean is the crossing
of the ocean of samsara, that is,the cycle of birth and death;</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The obstacles that Hanumanji faced on the
way, are the obstacles, that any endeavouring spiritual seaker is destined
to&nbsp; face;</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The various mansions and sense attractions
seen by Hanumanji in Lanka,and his crossing them with immense sense control,
are the various koshas, or the various layers of human personality, through
which we&nbsp; have to penetrate;</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Hanumanji's finding the mother,Sitaji, is
the seeker&#146;s&nbsp; success, in finding the perpetual, eternal spark of
divinity within him, which will take him to a world of total joy and bliss.</font></b></li>
</ul>
<b><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Sundarakandam is considered to be the
power house of the Ramayana.&nbsp; Who ever reads of listens to it with
total shraddha and bhakti, will&nbsp; soon be devoid of all physical ailments,
worries, poverty, etc. It rejuvenates a person, and more than anything,
take the person closer to&nbsp; the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</font></b>
<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thus ends the Sundarakandam, the beautiful
description of the obedience&nbsp; of a Bhakta,&nbsp; of his Master&#146;s wish,
his crossing the ocean of a 100&nbsp; yojanas, his emotional, beautiful
speech with the mother of the&nbsp; universe, his returning with victory,
and finally, his reuniting of two&nbsp; eternal lovers.</font>
