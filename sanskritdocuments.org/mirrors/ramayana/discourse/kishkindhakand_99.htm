<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Kishkinda was ruled by a monkey king Vali
who was renowned for his strength and valour.&nbsp; Once, an asura named Mayavi challenged
him for a duel.&nbsp; A fierce fight erupted between Mayavi and Vali in the outskirts of
Kishkinda, and Vali's brother Sugriva watched them praying that his brother should win the
duel.&nbsp; The two entered a cave and continued fighting in the cave for more than a
year.&nbsp; Sugriva who waited all this period, returned home in sorrow assuming his
brother was dead.&nbsp; The elders of Kishkinda appointed Sugriva as the king to succeed
Vali.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">After some years,&nbsp; Vali suddenly
returned to Kishkinda, and found that his country was now being ruled by his brother
Sugriva.&nbsp; He mistook that his brother usurped his kingdom and threw him out of the
Kishkinda and captured his wife.&nbsp; &quot;A wise
monkey&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the monkey that does not monkey with
another monkey's monkey &quot;&nbsp; Sugriva took refuge on a mountain named Rishyamooka
as he knew that his brother could not pursue him there because of a curse on him by a
sage.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">One day he noticed two young men who looked
like tapasvins wandering around his hiding place, searching for someone. He also noticed
that they had bows, arrows and swords.&nbsp; He was afraid that they were hitmen employed
by his brother to kill him.&nbsp; He sent his minister Hanuman to investigate.&nbsp;
Hanuman disguised himself as a brahmin and approached the two men and politely enquired
about their credentials.&nbsp; They introduced themselves as Dasarathaputras Rama and
Lakshmana and that they were in search of Rama's wife Sita who was abducted by a rakshasa.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">They also told Hanuman that they were on the
lookout for Sugriva for help.&nbsp; Convinced of their good intentions, Hanuman identified
himself and guided them to Sugriva.&nbsp; He introduced Rama and Lakshmana to Sugriva and
appraised Sugriva of Rama's need for help.&nbsp; Sugriva was pleased about the noble
stature of the brothers and greeted them.&nbsp; During the conversation that followed, he
narrated his sorrowful story of how he is being hounded by his own brother and pleaded
with Rama to put an end to his misery.&nbsp; Rama who always stood by Dharma promised to
kill Vali and redeem his kingdom.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Later Sugriva told them about an incident a
few days back when he saw a Rakshasa drag a beautiful princess like lady across the
sky.&nbsp; Sugriva heard her shout the names of Rama and Lakshmana and then saw her drop
her jewels tied in a piece of cloth she had torn from her mantle down to the place where
Sugriva was sitting.&nbsp; On hearing this Rama was anxious to see the bundle.&nbsp; On
seeing it, he immediately recognised the piece of silk yellow cloth as that of
Sita's.&nbsp; To be doubly sure, he then asked Lakshmana to identify the jewels.&nbsp;
Lakshmana replied that other than the anklets which he used to see every time he fell at
the lotus feet of Sita for her blessings, he had no idea of what other jewels she
wore.&nbsp; He confirmed that the anklets were that of Sita.&nbsp; Rama was very upset now
that Sita's abduction was confirmed, but revived himself after being consoled by Sugriva.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>A bond of friendship was forged, built on
mutual affection.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Though Rama had promised to kill Vali,
Sugriva had his doubts since he knew about Vali's valour and also since he had not yet
seen Rama's skills being displayed.&nbsp; With great hesitation, he asked Rama to prove
his mettle by successfully overcoming two challenges- one to lift the skeleton of the
asura named Dhundhubi and throw it to a distance of 100 bows and the other to pierce sala
tree with his arrow.&nbsp; Rama was unperturbed by the challenge and very soon, proved
himself to better than Sugriva's expectations.&nbsp; Sugriva, overcome joy, requested Rama
to kill Vali immediately.&nbsp; Accordingly, they went to the gates of Kishkindha and
Sugriva let out a roar signifying his intention to challenge Vali for a bout of fight.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Vali, on hearing this, became&nbsp; amused
rather than angry as he thought that Sugriva was no match for him.&nbsp; Nonetheless, as
is customary to honour such challenges, he set about for a duel with Sugriva.&nbsp; A
fierce duel ensued and the brothers fought valiantly.&nbsp; Sugriva was confident that
very soon Rama would keep up his promise and kill Vali.&nbsp; But then as time ;passed by,
Sugriva was slowly being overpowered by his elder brother and Rama did not keep up his
promise.&nbsp; He retreated hastily, thoroughly confused about Rama's lack of
response.&nbsp; When he met Rama later he expressed his disappointment at what had
happened.&nbsp; Rama explained to him that he could not kill Vali because he looked so
identical to Sugriva and there was a possibility that the wrong person would be
killed.&nbsp; To overcome this problem, a garland was placed on Sugriva's neck.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Once again, Sugriva challenged Vali, certain
that Rama would not fail this time.&nbsp; As the fight progressed, Rama waited for the
right opportunity to kill Vali and when such a moment came by, he shot an arrow which
pierced 6 sala trees and lodged itself straight into the heart of Vali.&nbsp; Vali fell to
the ground, hurt more by the fact that he was felled by a third person who was not part of
the fight than by the arrow itself.&nbsp; Vali accused Rama of being an adharmi who
attacked him unwarrantedly.&nbsp; With great distress he said that Rama lacked qualities
of truthfulness and valour.&nbsp; Vali asked &quot;what right did you have to interfere in
my personal fight with Sugriva? You are a Kshatriya and you are well versed in the nuances
of Dharma but then I was deceived by your reputation.&nbsp; You righteousness is just a
pretence.&nbsp; If you had challenged me and fought with me I would certainly have
defeated you.&nbsp; But you stealthily attacked me and killed me because you wanted to
please Sugriva so that he may help you finding Sita.&nbsp; Had you approached me first I
would have released Sita from the clutches of Ravana and brought her back to you in a
single day.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">On hearing all these accusations Rama
replied with great choice of words clarity of thought. He said, &quot; You don't seem to
know all about Dharma, Artha and Kama and yet you accuse me of having overstepped the
boundaries of Dharma.&nbsp; This world, this forest with its mountains, its rivers and
lakes, are all ruled by the Kings of Raghuvamsa and its well within their limits to punish
inmates of their cities or forests. You are an adharmi since you are sinful in behaviour
and lustful.&nbsp; You should have treated Sugriva like a son, but have wronged him by
ill-treating him and capturing his wife.&nbsp; You have transgressed the rules of Dharma
and I, as a representative of king Bharatha, have punished you for it.&nbsp; Moreover we
rajarishis will always kill wild animals by hiding and by various traps and snares.&nbsp;
I consider you a wild animal and hence am justified in treating you as such.&nbsp; I do
not think I acted wrongly.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">On hearing Rama's words Vali was now
convinced that Rama was flawless.&nbsp; He said, &quot; I abide by what you say.&nbsp; I
am convinced that you can do no wrong.&nbsp; Please bless me before I leave this
world.&nbsp; Please protect my wife and son and guide Sugriva in ruling Kishkindha from
now on.&quot;&nbsp; He then breathed his last.&nbsp; His wife Tara was grieved to learn
that her husband was dead.&nbsp; Hanuman tried to console Tara and said,</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>&quot; A man reaps the fruit of his
actions whether good or bad and death grants him these fruits.&nbsp; There is no cause for
grief in this world where everything is transient.&nbsp; Birth &amp; Death are inevitable
and life on earth is not permanent.&nbsp; That is the reason why a man should try to do as
many good things when he is alive. </b>As the wife of Vali, your duty to comfort your son
Angada and think of his welfare&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite this effort from Hanuman,
Tara was inconsolable.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">When Sugriva saw Vali's wife weeping
piteously, he was filled with a sense of remorse and guilt for having been the reason for
all this unhappiness fro a mere piece of land.&nbsp; Sensing the mood of unhappiness all
around him, Rama reminded everyone gently about the need to get on with life and perform
Vali's last rites.&nbsp; He spoke again about the power of fate over everyone and
everything.&nbsp; He said, &quot; No one can circumvent fate.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>In this world fate is the only cause for
every happening.&nbsp; No man does anything on his own; nor is he free to command anyone
to do anything.&nbsp; Fate is the sole power which rules the actions of man.&nbsp; No one
can escape the rulings of fate.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">How&nbsp; true !&nbsp; It is my fate that I
am here in front of you talking about a subject with minimal knowledge and it is your
cruel fate that you should be here listening&nbsp; to it.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Fate is neither partial nor has it any
personal gain or loss to sustain.&nbsp; Fate makes man suffer or enjoy pleasure and man is
helpless in the hands of fate.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Raise up yourselves from this despondency
and perform the last rites of Vali&quot;&nbsp; With this elaboration on fate by Rama, the
vanaras were convinced and proceeded to perform the last rites of Vali.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">After the last rites of Vali, everyone stood
silent, not knowing what to do next.&nbsp; Hanuman requested Rama to command them and lead
them to Kishkindha but Rama refused saying he had vowed never to step into any kingdom for
fourteen years.&nbsp; With the best wishes of Rama and Lakshmana, Sugriva was crowned as
the king and Vali's son Angada the yuvaraja.&nbsp; Sugriva was reunited with his wife and
spent many years ruling Kishkindha.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Shri RamajayaM</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#009900" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i><u>Ms. Lakshmi Varma</u></i></b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">From the earlier&nbsp; explanation&nbsp; we
understand how Lord Rama succeeds in returning Sugreeva his lost kingdom and glory and
crowns him King of Kishkinda. As it turns out to be the beginning of the rainy season,
he&nbsp; proceeds&nbsp; to the Prasravena mountains, eagerly waiting for the rainy season
to get over and for sugreeva to fulfill his&nbsp; promise to help him find&nbsp; Sita
Devi&nbsp; along with with the assistance of the mighty Hanuman and the other vanaras.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, Sugreeva gets so enthralled in
his worldly attachments that he had to be reminded by Hanuman&nbsp; of his present
position&nbsp; which was because of a favour from Lord Rama. Hanunam tells him in&nbsp; a
very subtle but emphatic way to awaken and not to forget the promise he had&nbsp; made to
Lord Rama.&nbsp; Hanuman&#146;s sincerity and devotion&nbsp; towards his master Lord Rama
cannot&nbsp; be surpassed by anyone , as he is so well aware of his responsibility and
needn&#146;t be reminded.&nbsp; His dedication is shown , when&nbsp; he takes the
responsibility&nbsp; to remind&nbsp; Sugriva&nbsp; how essential it is for one to keep his
word. On the other hand we&nbsp; have the short tempered Lakshmana&nbsp; whose life also
literally rotates around Sri Rama and whose anger knows no bounds and who has to be
finally pacified by Angada and Tara.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Even a noble soul like Sugreeva lapses into
failure of duty while living in the midst of luxury. What we need to understand is though
for a moment he had forgotten, but a good soul that&nbsp; he is, he corrects himself
immediately. A good soul is always&nbsp; amenable to correction.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Sugreeva then summons all the monkeys and
assigns each one different directions to pursue the search.&nbsp; For sometime it appeared
that their search was all in vain and all were totally dejected but they do not want to
face Lord Rama unsuccessful as they&nbsp; have seen how he missed his wife. It is there
that they come across&nbsp; Sampati brother of Jatayu&nbsp; who&nbsp; then&nbsp; directs
them&nbsp; to Lanka the abode of Ravana. The vanaras were filled with hope and started
planning as&nbsp; to how to&nbsp; reach their destination and finally come to a conclusion
that it is only Hanuman who is capable of completing this formidable task. Hanuman then
leaps into the sky towards Lanka.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Hanuman , known for his humility, though
aware of his strength, still silently waits for&nbsp; Jambavan&nbsp; to order him to go
ahead. He doesn&#146;t want to supersede anybody and this shows his respect and obedience
for&nbsp; the authority .&nbsp; These days we hear something called the generation gap.
We&nbsp; on the whole refuse to listen to what&nbsp; our elders have to say as we think
that they are not in tune&nbsp; with today&#146;s modern world and&nbsp; it is only when
our actions fail&nbsp; that we realise, Oh ! How I wish I could have obeyed my elders
advice.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Knowing one&#146;sstrengths and yet&nbsp;
learning&nbsp; to remain humble shows nobility of&nbsp; one&#146;s character.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In these chapters we see Lord Rama sitting
very patiently thinking about Sita Devi&nbsp; all the time hoping to see her soon and
wishing for her well being.&nbsp; One always wonders&nbsp; why Lord Rama who is an
incarnation of GOD himself had to go through all these travails. There is certainly a
hidden reason to this.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">It is a clear indication to us that every
human undergoes different emotions whether&nbsp; it is happiness or sorrow and during our
times of sorrow&nbsp; we have to wait patiently without losing our hope, and&nbsp; GOD
alone will set things right at the right time.&nbsp; <b>We have the misconcept that our
timings of our actions are perfect as we cannot see the future and that&#146;s where we go
wrong.</b> All of us are in a hurry to let things happen and the childlike impulse in each
one of us sometimes make us commit blunders.&nbsp; We forget the fact that everything is
ruled and controlled by the LORD and no matter how much anxiety we show&nbsp; we have to
wait&nbsp; for the time, when things are destined to happen . Large number of people turn
to GOD&nbsp; when they have lost everything and&nbsp; are&nbsp; weakest, and then
find&nbsp; that GOD was there all along and&nbsp; ever waiting&nbsp; to fill his strength
in&nbsp; them.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">It is very human to lose our mental
equipoise when our tensions are at its peak. It is at that time that our trust and faith
in&nbsp; GOD help us regain our normal self. And a sincere heartfelt word of encouragement
from someone who understands our situation helps us actually face it with more vigour.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>It is by the grace of GOD that we meet
the right people during our&nbsp; troubled times who really shower their love and support
us like a strong pillar.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is like Lakshmana&#146;s undaunted love and
support towards Rama&nbsp; at a time when he was separated from SitaDevi.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In life we come across instances&nbsp; where
we have been helped by strangers. We&nbsp; do owe them a lot for their&nbsp; timely help .</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>What we need to understand from Lord
Rama&#146;s gesture to help Sugreeva is that just as he didn&#146;t think twice before he
helped Sugreeva the king of Vanaras, we shouldn&#146;t discriminate while offering help
and&nbsp; should not expect anything in return.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Lord Rama had not hoped for anything when he
helped Sugreeva.&nbsp; It is after Sugreeva gained all that he lost, that he made a
promise to Lord Rama that he would help him find Sita Devi.&nbsp; Our help shouldn&#146;t
be business like with any ulterior motive, let us be genuine and sincere and have a
selfless attitude. Sometimes we may not be able to repay the person who has helped us ,
but we can always willingly help out someone else who seeks our help.&nbsp; And being able
to help someone&nbsp; keeping aside our own problems is&nbsp; total selflessness.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Man is what his mind is.&nbsp;</b>
Whatever he experiences in the world is according to his mind. <b>When our mind is happy
we find&nbsp; the whole world happy and when we are depressed we find the whole world
depressing. We have to control our thought process tune our mind&nbsp; and try and be a
better person.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Like Gurunanak has said he who has conquered
the mind has conquered the world.</font> </p>

<p align="center"><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Jai shree Ram.</b></font> </p>
