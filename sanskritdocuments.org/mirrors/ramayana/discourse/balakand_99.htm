<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the kingdom of Kosala ruled&nbsp; King Dasaratha of
Ishwaku dynasty.&nbsp; Ayodhya was its capital.&nbsp; Under the able stewardship of the
ruler the&nbsp; kingdom flourished and prospered. <b>The proof of the pudding is that he
managed to have three wives Kausalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitra and <u>keep them all happy too !</u></b></font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">In administering the country, he was ably assisted by a
council of 8 Ministers (too small by today's Indian Standards).&nbsp; Sage Vasishta and
Sage Vamadeva were there to guide the King and his Ministers.&nbsp; The people of Ayodhya
were very happy and contended and there were no hassles of inflation/taxes/savings/loan
burdens/subsidies, etc.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mean to say that the king and his subjects were
leading an utopian life?</font></b> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">No not really.&nbsp; The king had everything except off
springs.&nbsp; This worry increased as his age and it reached a flash point.&nbsp; The
king sought the advice of Sage Vasishta and his council of Ministers and decided to
perform the Aswamedha yaga.&nbsp; Meanwhile the Devas had a problem.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Comic Sans MS">Even Devas!!</font></b> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Yes. Devas historically have been running into problems
with rakshasas who are bestowed with boons from one of the Trimurhtys and when they cannot
handle on their own they escalate their problems to the Trimurthys.&nbsp; It is also&nbsp;
funny in a way as it is one of the Trimurthys who give away boons to the rakshasas and
enable them to harass the Devas.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming to the problem on hand, Ravana ten headed demon <b>(imagine
just a one headed human being is tough to handle) </b>was troubling the Devas.&nbsp; He
had a boon from Brahma&nbsp; that he cannot be harmed or killed by the Devas.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">So the Devas went to Brahma and told him that his boon to
Ravana has turned out to be a nightmare for them and cried for his help.&nbsp; Brahma told
them not to worry.&nbsp; God always thinks of the future when he acts.&nbsp; When he&nbsp;
granted the boon to Ravana, Brahma would have known of the repercussions and the thought
of the solution too.&nbsp; You see that is what we lesser mortals do not understand and
think that we are smart.&nbsp; In fact every one who asks a boon thinks that he/she is
smart.&nbsp; But God always wins.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me narrate an anecdote here.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">A mosquito went on a penance and God pleased with the
penance appeared before the mosquito and offered a boon.&nbsp; Mosquito thinking big of
itself wanted to ask the Lord that if it bites anyone they should die.&nbsp; But what it
asked the God was &quot;SHOULD DIE WHEN I BITE&quot;&nbsp; and the Lord said&nbsp; <b>&quot;thathasthu&quot;&nbsp;
</b>The mosquito meant that the target should die but failed to bring out clearly and
Lord's boon was that the mosquito would die whenever it bites anyone!!!!&nbsp; A
boomerang.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> <b>Now you know what happens to mosquitos when they bite.</b></i></font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Likewise, Ravana too had left some gaps in his
request.&nbsp; He did not include human beings <b>(Ha!!! You see those days how harmless
our forefathers were!)&nbsp; </b>and monkeys and bears as his enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp; So
Brahma suggested that they all would request Lord Vishnu to assume the form of human being
and do the needful.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to their request, Lord Vishnu launched&nbsp;<b>
&quot; Operation Destroy Ravana &quot; </b>and all the plans were clearly chalked out and
phase 1 of the operation is the Balakanda which is the birth of Rama and his brothers.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Back in Ayodhya king Dasaratha performed the Aswamedha yaga
followed by the Putra kameshti yaga.&nbsp; A divine form appepared and offered an urn
containing payasam and requested Dasaratha to give it to his wives upon which they would
conceive.&nbsp; It so happened that Kausalya and Kaikeyi each had one portion while
Sumitra had two portions.&nbsp; The king was happy and waited patiently for the birth of
children.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">12 months had passed since the queens had taken
payasa.&nbsp; According to Hindu Dharma before a child dwells 3 months in the father and 9
months in the mother's womb.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the month of Chaitra during Shuklapaksha and
Navami thithi the 3 planets were in a very auspicious position&nbsp; and the Lagna was
Karkata.&nbsp; The planet Guru was raising with the moon and the star was Punarvasu.&nbsp;
At this auspicious time the Lord was born to Kaushalya.&nbsp; The Lord had taken on the
form of a human to put an end to all evil and benefit mankind.&nbsp; When the next star
Pushya rose, Kaikeyi gave birth to a son and when the next star Ashlesha appeared Sumitra
gave birth to twins.&nbsp; King Dasaratha was overjoyed at the birth of his 4 sons, the
people of Ayodhya rejoiced at the birth of the princess and the Devas in Heaven rained
flowers <b>(probably the laser shows and fire works of those days) </b>At last the person
who would relieve them from the rakshasas had taken birth.&nbsp; The 4 sons of Dasharatha
were all the Lord of His amshas.&nbsp; Kaushalya's son&nbsp; RAMA was the Narayana
Himself, Kaikeyi's son&nbsp; BHARATH was the shanka of the Lord, Sumitra's son SHATRUGHNA
was the Chakra and the other son of Sumitra LAKSHMANA was Adhisesha.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">RAMA was the embodiment of all virtues and was like the
ocean calm and serene on the outside and deeply rich in knowledge inside.&nbsp; Lakshmana
was like the bubble on the water ever ready to burst; but he was Rama's second self who
lived his whole life for Rama.&nbsp; Even as infants , Rama and Lakshmana were
inseparable.&nbsp; It was as if there were 1 life in 2 bodies.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">BHARATHA was&nbsp; like a candle selfless, sacrificing in
nature and always obedient.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">SATRUGHNA was a very learned and a compassionate person <b>(Like
the ones you see today wearing specs and carrying books in hand where ever they go)</b></font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The children grew up right royally and were learning all the
tricks of the trade <b>( of the right kind)&nbsp;</b> They were all adept and skillful in
archery, etc.&nbsp; <b>If they were to be today they might have won some medals for India
in archery, fencing etc. in the Asiad and Olympics !!!</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As years passed by one fine day Sage Viswamitra came down to
Ayodhya to visit Dasaratha.&nbsp; Dasaratha with all humility welcomed the Sage to his
court, inquired about his work and gave his word that he will do anything to please the
Sage.&nbsp; <b>(This is where the difference between a human and the God's word comes in)</b>&nbsp;
Dasaratha realised this on more than one occasion as you will see in a short while.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sage Viswamitra said that he was performing a yaga at his
ashram and the demons were frustrating him by disturbing the yaga.&nbsp; So he requested
Dasaratha to let him take Rama and Lakshmana with him to guard the yagna and kill the
demons so that the yaga could be completed successfully.&nbsp; Dasaratha was
shocked.&nbsp; This was like a bolt from the blue. He told the Sage that Rama and
Lakshmana were too young to do such a work and he offered his own services and that of his
huge army.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">He tried to convince the Sage but Sage Viswamitra would not
let up.&nbsp; The sage was losing his patience and told Dasaratha that he was going back
on his word.&nbsp; Dasaratha was in really confused state ( the difference we were talking
about a few minutes ago)&nbsp; Dasaratha had never been away from his children and if Rama
and Lakshmana were to go with Sage Vishwamitra and that too to kill the demons in the
forest he cannot&nbsp; even talk to them <b>(if it were to be this age he might have given
them a mobile to carry with them!) </b>He was not sure how long the separation would be.</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sage&nbsp; Vasishta who knew too well about Vishwamitra's
hidden&nbsp; agenda asked Dasaratha to let the boys go along with the great sage.&nbsp;
Sage Vishwamitra,&nbsp; to start with,&nbsp; was a king and attained the status of Brahma
Rishi after going through trials and tribulations.&nbsp; He is credited with creating
Trishanku heaven and so on.&nbsp; The sage had the power to awaken the Lord.&nbsp; He
could see the past, present and the future.&nbsp; He initiated the Lord in his mission to
fight the evil and restore dharma.&nbsp; Even today in most of the temples in India, the
Lord is awakened through sage Vishwamitra's hymn - <b>Kaushalya Rama Poorva Sandhya
Pravarchathe ............</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The king realised the underlying truth apologized to the
sage and accepted to send Rama and Lakshmana with him.&nbsp; After seeking the blessings
of all elders the 2 brothers set out along with sage Vishwamitra to the rishi's
ashram.&nbsp; On their way to the ashram, the sage narrated stories of valour to Rama and
Lakshmana.&nbsp; It was at this time that the rishi taught them the powerful mantras Bala
and Atibala, the daughters of Brahma which would help them fight hunger, thirst and
fatigue in their long journey as well as when they would fight the demons.&nbsp; The
journey took them past many ashrams and the 2 princes took the blessings of all the
rishis.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">As they crossed river SARAYU, they entered a forest and
Rama's first encounter with a demoness occurred.&nbsp; A huge E.T. sized Tataka appeared
on the scene and tried to harm the 3 of them.&nbsp; Under Vishwamitra's instructions Rama
fired an arrow at the demonness and killed&nbsp; her.&nbsp; No sooner had Rama done this,
the devas rained blessings on him.&nbsp; Pleased with this success of Rama Sage
Vishwamitra promised Rama that he would give even greater weapons to defeat any enemy as
the rishi knew that Rama's work was far from complete and was still to deal with the
powerful Ravana and his demons <b>(obviously there were no restrictions on transfer of
military technology or arms control)</b></font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The 3 of them reached Siddhasharma --the place where Lord
Narayana had taken the Vamana Avatar.&nbsp; Since the yaga Vishwamitra was performing was
for the good of mankind, he chose this ashram as it was a place where everyone's wishes
were fulfilled.&nbsp; Sage&nbsp; Vishwamitra commenced the yaga.&nbsp; After 5 days of
quiet, suddenly on 6th day demons Maricha, Subhahu and their cronies appeared and
attempted to disrupt the proceedings.&nbsp; Rama used the Manav astra against Maricha
which carried him to a distance of 100 yojanas and threw him into the sea.&nbsp; But it
did not kill him.&nbsp; Then with the Ageney astra and the Vayav astra Rama put an end to
the other rakshasa Subhau and his battalion.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">The yaga was completed successfully and there was great joy
in the hearts of all the rishis.&nbsp; Sage Vishwamitra praised Rama for his display of
courage in killing the rakshasas who had always tried to interrupt this yaga.&nbsp; The
3&nbsp; finally left the forest and headed for Mithila.&nbsp; On the way they passed the
Gautama ashram, which was once occupied by the great rishi Gautama and his beautiful wife
Ahalya.&nbsp; Ahalya had once sinned and so Rishi Gautama had cursed her to remain a stone
unseen by anyone till Rama set foot in the ashram. the ashram would then&nbsp; be
sanctified and Ahalya would be cleansed of her sin and then regain her form.&nbsp; Thus
when Rama and Lakshmana entered the ashram, Ahalya was released from her curse.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Soon they reached Mithila where the King Janaka was
performing a yaga.&nbsp; He was pleased to see the rishi and welcomed him with great
honour.&nbsp; The king was curious to know who the 2 young men with were.&nbsp; The sage
introduced Rama and Lakshmana as the sons of King Dasaratha.&nbsp; The king stated that he
had a daughter Sita gifted to him by Bhoomadevi and he was on the lookout for an
alliance.&nbsp; To win her, all one had to do was to lift the bow of Mahadeva and string
it <b>(how things have changed!&nbsp; These days men dictate in the marriage market)&nbsp;
</b>The king also mentioned that no man had shown the strength even to lift this
bow.&nbsp; Everyone right from devas, asuras, yakshas, gandharvas, kinnaras and even
rakshasas were unable to lift the bow.&nbsp; Sage Vishwamitra asked Rama to attempt to
string the bow.&nbsp; Rama sought the blessings of the rishi and all elders and with no
effort whatsoever, hoisted the bow from its casing and started to string it.&nbsp; As he
did so the bow snapped into 2 and fell down. First,there was&nbsp; disbelief, then
everyone stood and praised Rama.&nbsp; King Janaka, overwhelmed at this sight, sought the
permission of the rishi and sent messengers to Ayodhya to inform the monarch about Rama's
deeds and as to how he had won the hand of his daughter Sita.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS">Dasaratha was happy beyond words and wasted no time and made
arrangements to leave for the wedding.&nbsp; On reaching Mithila, the kings- Dasaratha
and&nbsp; Janaka also decided the wedding of Lakshmana to Urmila the 2nd daughter of
Janaka;&nbsp; Bharatha and Shatrughna were to be married to Mandavi and Srutakiti--the 2
daughters of Janaka's brothers.&nbsp; The weddings took place on the Uttara Phalguni
nakshatra.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b><i>SITA KALYANAM VAI BHOGAME ; RAMA

with devotion and sincerity will be benefited.&nbsp; Unmarried girls will find no
obstacles in their marriage, childless people will be blessed with children and attain
heaven on mortality.</font></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">In conclusion let us repeat the name of Rama
thrice--with our minds filled with joy and love.&nbsp; By repeating His name, all our sins
are destroyed and miseries are terminated.&nbsp; The single name of Rama dries up the
whole ocean of the world process.</font> </p>
