<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">This Kanda describes about Thirteen years of
SriRama&#146;s exile.&nbsp; In a&nbsp; nutshell, this Kanda starts at Chitrakoota with the
departure of Bharata, describes the Satsangh of SriRama with an array of great Saints and
Sages, destruction of Rakshasas like Khara,Dushana, Maricha&nbsp; and a consequent
abduction of Sita by Ravana.&nbsp; The purpose of Rama Avatar was to liberate his devotees
and to protect Dharma.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sri Krishna in Gita retold the same philosophy,</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Parithranaya sadhunam, vinashayacha
dushkrutham</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Dharma samsthapanarthaya sambhavami yuge
yuge</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">And it in this Kanda, Lord starts his divine
mission by protecting the Good against the Evil.&nbsp; Sharanagathy and the uncompromising
fidelity to righteousness and the right way to lead a life i.e. upholding Dharma at any
cost&nbsp; are the key messages from this Kanda.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">This Kanda evolves beautifully in such a way
that Rama&#146;s each meeting with a Sage not only leads him to be in Satsangh with
another Sage but also enables him to fulfill his missions.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Now to the Aranya Kanda Sri Rama is&nbsp;
haunted by memories of Bharata and so&nbsp; Rama chooses to leave Chitrakoota and they
arrive at the hermitage of Sage Atri and Anusuya.&nbsp; Anusuya is a great tapasvini who
is pleased with humble Sita for her devotion to her husband and her fully contended life.
Then Anusuya gifts Sita with costly ornaments, Clothes and perfumes so as to please Rama
and intern Sita humbly accepts the gifts of this tapasvini.</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>We should note here and learn from Sita
    &#150; Never to say no, when someone gives something with love, even Karela Pickle.&nbsp;
    Though Sita was Mahalakshmi herself, yet she did not decline the devotee&#146;s gift given
    with love.</b></font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Well- like Anusuya, we should learn to
    detach ourselves from worldly things and also to part with our valuables.&nbsp; But we are
    all Anusuyas to the extent of parting with ice-cream boxes, Nido cans and other surplus
    items.&nbsp; We even seem to hold on to Mothercare/Sana bags.</b></font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">

<p>They now proceeded towards the Dandaka forest.&nbsp; And as they moved deeper into the
forest&nbsp; they noticed an unfriendly silence.&nbsp; They are caught by a terrible
rakshaka by name Viradha who threatened&nbsp; to eat up Sita.&nbsp; Rama and
Lakshmana&nbsp; chopped off the Rakhshasa&#146;s hands who assumes the form of a Gandarva
is liberated at the hands of Sri Rama.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Yet another mission of Rama&nbsp; i.e.&nbsp;
giving moksha to Viradha is accomplished here and he in turn guides them to the ashram of
Sage Sarabanga.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">As they reach Sage Sarabanga&#146;s ashram,
they see the Chariot of Indra. The Sage&nbsp; declines to join Indra&nbsp; who had come to
take him to come to Swargalog but instead chooses to serve Rama.&nbsp; When the Sage wants
to gift all his Tapas, Rama gently declines it saying that each person has to earn his
punya&nbsp; by his own conduct.&nbsp; The messages we carry home from this meeting,</font>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>From Tapasvis and Sajjanas like Sarabanga
    and others, we can learn that even Swargalog is not so attractive or important than being
    in Satsangh with a noble guest like Rama.&nbsp; Adi Shankara also reiterates the same
    concept in Bhaja Govindam in the verse,</b></font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>

<p>'Satsangatvae nissangatvam nissangatvae nirmohatvam</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Nirmohatvae nischalatatvam nischalatatvae
jeevanmuktihi&#146;</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>At least after knowing its essence, let
us not skip our Satsangh on Thursdays and Saturdays under any pretext!</b></font> 

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Secondly, spiritual uplift is something
    that can only be earned by Practice and it can neither be purchased nor accepted as a
    Gift.&nbsp; We fail to understand the divinity and the eternal bliss within us instead we
    seek the transient happiness in parties, movies, Seef Maal, Nallis etc.</b></font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">

<p>After leaving Sarabanga&#146;s place, Rama meets many others Rishis who surrender to
him and plead for his protection from himsa of Rakshasas like Khara and others.&nbsp; Rama
accepts the responsibility and offers protection for the Sages.&nbsp; They now proceed to
the ashram of Sage Sutheekshana.&nbsp; Rama declines a similar offer of&nbsp; the results
of tapas from Sage Sutheekshana.&nbsp; The Sage advises them to come back the ashram after
visiting the&nbsp; all the Sages in the Dandaka forest.&nbsp;&nbsp; As they move along,
Rama keeps entertaining Sita by talking to her sweetly and pleasantly so that she
overcomes the tiredness of the journey.&nbsp; During the period spent in Dandaka forest,
Rama, Sita and Lakshmana appear to enjoy the Fauna and Flora &#150; lead a a very peaceful
life - a life in perfect harmony with nature forgetting all their misfortune.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>We note here that even though they were
living in the forest, they were happy and contented.&nbsp; Though we have the best of
comforts, we still curse our fate and crave for those things that we don't have.&nbsp;
There is a saying,</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>&#145;There is enough in this world for
everyone's need but there is not enough in</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>the entire Universe to satisfy one's
greed&#146;.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">During their traverses, Sita asks the Lord
on three attitudes to Adarma - What are the 3 things considered as adharma?</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">a) Utterance of falsehood</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">b) Thinking of other man's wife</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">c) Hurting someone whom has not offended
you&nbsp; and seeks clarification i.e.,</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">She tells Rama,</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;I know that</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">a) You have never spoken untruth nor you never
will</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">b) You see your mother Kousalya in every woman
except your wife.</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (How we all wish to say the
same about our Spouses?)</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">c) But how, you could give a word to the Rishis
that you would destroy the Rakshasas when they have done you no harm?</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">The Lord clarifies Sita's doubt thus:</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot; As Kshattriya, it is my duty to
protect the&nbsp; Good and destroy the Evil even if I am in the grab of a tapasvi.&nbsp;
The uncompromising fidelity to righteousness is my Dharma.&nbsp; I will even give up my
life, or&nbsp; You or Lakshmana- but never sway from the Truth as it is my swadharma to
protect these rishis who have abandoned their homes and worldly pleasures to do
tapas.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Rama&#146;s mission was to uphold Dharma
at any cost whereas, we uphold everything else at the cost of Dharma.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Thus, they spent about Ten years in the
Dandaka forest moving from place to place and meeting various Saints and Sages.&nbsp; They
reach the ashram of Sage Agasthya.&nbsp; During the meeting, the famed Sage gave SriRama,
Vishnu&#146;s Dhanush, two inexhaustible quivers, a sword used by Lord Narayana himself
during a war in Heavens and an&nbsp; Armor that cannot be pierced.&nbsp; Also,
he&nbsp;&nbsp; told that Indra&#146;s Charioteer Matali would bring the Indra&#146;s
Chariot to him at an appropriate time.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>If you recall in Bala Kanda, Sage
Vishwamitra passes on all his knowledge of astras to Rama. This is yet another example of
our scriptural insistence that, knowledge and achievement of life&#146;s objectives can
only be acquired either through a Guru or in a Satsangh.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>In Bhaja Govindam, Adi Shankara says that
if we sit in the boat of Satsangh, we can sail across the ocean of samsara to the shore of
eternal bliss.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Now, the sage asks Rama to proceed to
Panchavati to spend the rest of the days waiting for the Great events to come.&nbsp; On
their way to Panchavati, they meet Jatayu, the Eagle - The son of Aruna, the Charioteer to
Sun, the brother of Sampati and&nbsp; a close friend of their father Dasaratha.&nbsp;
Jatayu offers to guide them to Panchavati and promises to stay close to them&nbsp; for
safety of Sita.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Panchavati, Lakshmana builds a beautiful ashram at the site
selected by Rama. (When Rama asks Lakshmana to choose a good location&nbsp; for the
ashram, Lakshmana declines to do so.&nbsp; The reason he gives is that he is only a
servant of Rama who takes orders and executes.&nbsp; At the same time, we find many
instances, When Rama is in deep anguish, he does not hesitate to speak the Satya boldly
and console Rama when he is in sorrow.&nbsp; In addition to being an excellent Devotee
Lakshmana shows us how a true companion should behave.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">During their stay in Panchavati, there comes
accidentally, Surpanaga, an ugly woman, a Kami and the Sister of Ravana.&nbsp; Being a
Kami, she immediately falls in love with Rama.&nbsp; Rama, in one of his rare lighter
moments, tells her to approach Lakshmana as he is single.&nbsp; Immediately she goes to
Lakshmana and expresses her love.&nbsp; Now it is Lakshmana&#146;s turn to send her back
to Rama saying that as a full time servant he has no time for woman. Frustrated by their
responses, she gets upset and decides to eat up Sita.&nbsp; Now Rama tells Lakshmana to
restrain Surpanaga from attacking Sita and he promptly maims her by chopping her ears and
nose.</font> 

<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Object of Lust-the word lust here
    symbolises our desires; keeps changing. Whereas object of Love never changes!</b></font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>We all behave like Surpanaka &#150; our
    desires continuously changing &amp; Never ending; misery being the end result!!</b></font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">

<p>Humiliated Surpanaga rushes to her brother Khara for help who promptly dispatches&nbsp;
14 valiant men to defeat Rama.&nbsp; On their destruction, he himself goes to attack Rama
with an army of 14,000 Rakshasas.&nbsp; Rama asks Lakshmana to take Sita away to safety
and faces the huge army alone.&nbsp; SriRama stood like MahaDeva and destroyed Khara and
his army to protect the Rishis of Dandakaranya.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">By slaying rakshasa Khara Rama upholds his
vow on<b> protection of Dharma-</b>by killing Khara.&nbsp; Now, Akampana, a Rakhshasa from
Janastana escapes alive and manages to reach Ravana&#146;s court and briefs him of the
misfortune to his brothers and other Rakshasas.&nbsp; Ravana decides to attack Rama in
retaliation.&nbsp; Akampana warns Ravana that Rama cannot be conquered and hence suggests
stealing Sita so that Rama will die of separation.&nbsp; Ravana arrives at the ashram of
Maricha, his uncle who is now an Ascetic and asks for his&nbsp; help&nbsp; in the
abduction of Sita.&nbsp; Maricha is scared as he has already experienced the power of
Rama&#146;s arrows when he tried to disturb Sage Vishwamitra&#146;s yagna in Bala
Kanda.&nbsp; Maricha managed to convince Ravana that getting on the wrong side of Rama is
not in the best interest of Ravana.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Although Ravana was not scared of ( the
valour as he is yet to be poisoned by Surpanaka) Rama, he respected his uncle&#146;s
judgement and goes back to Lanka.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile Surpanaga lands up in
Ravana&#146;s court and projects herself as a victim of Rama.&nbsp; She claimed that her
only sin was that she tried to abduct Sita, the beautiful woman in the Universe for
Ravana&#146;s sake, and in the bargain got maimed and insulted. Further, Rama has
eliminated his brothers and other Rakshasas in Janastana thereby&nbsp; Rishi&#146;s are
freely roaming around in the Dandaka forest.&nbsp; Hence, she said &#145;Kill Rama &amp;
Lakshmana, protect your race, possess Sita as your wife and avenge the death of Rakshasas
in Janastana&#146;.&nbsp; Ravana lands up in Maricha&#146;s ashram again with a firm
intention to abduct Sita and orders Maricha to accomplish his goal.&nbsp; Being pushed to
a corner, it is a no-win situation for Maricha.&nbsp; He agrees to lure Sita as a Golden
Deer and draw Rama and Lakshmana away from Sita so that Ravana can abduct Sita.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>&#145;Vaisebi marne ka hai, Bhagavan ke
haath se marenge na,</b></font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Ye Jungli ke haath se kai ko marne ka?&#146;
thought Maricha.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">It is better I get killed by the Lord rather
than by Ravana &#150; said Maricha.&nbsp; Sita falling for the Golden Deer symbolises
that,</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Even good people, in their bad times,
fail to see the truth as they are trapped by maya.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">That&#146;s why as&nbsp; Rama is drawn away
from Sita and as Maricha falls to the arrows of Lord and shouts for Sita and Lakshmana in
a fake&nbsp; RAMA'S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voice &#150; it is Sita who again makes the mistake
of insisting that Lakshmana leave immediately.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Lakshmana represents the
&#145;Viveka&#148; the alert &#147;Adisesha&#148;- he alerted Rama that Golden Deer is a
Mayavi.&nbsp; Lakshmana alerts Sita that the &#147;SOS&#148; heard are also from a
Mayavi.&nbsp; But, fate has it that Viveka has to leave the scene to be replaced by kama,
Lakshmana the viveki exits and Ravana the kami enters-all as per the master plane of the
Lord.</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Sita abuses Lakshmana, questioning his
integrity and warns to kill herself if he doesn&#146;t rush to Rama&#146;s help.&nbsp;
Lakshmana leaves the ashram unwillingly at the behest of Sita and Ravana abducts Sita in
the disguise of a Sanyasi.&nbsp; When she was being carried away, Jatayu heard her cry for
help and fought valiantly with Ravana until he was fatally injured in the unequal combat.</font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Look at the culture of Vulture. It&#146;s
time we checked our falling values.&nbsp; How many times, we have seen Adarma and quality
turned our eyes away?</b></font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">While Sita was being carried away, she saw
five monkeys sitting on a hillock.&nbsp; She bundled her jewels and threw at them as an
indication of the direction of her travel.</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">MahaLakhmi throwing a bundle of jewels&nbsp; at
Sugreeva&nbsp; is a sign of ensuing prosperity for him as he is going to meet the Lord
very soon.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Finally Ravana lands in Lanka, carrying his
own death warrant in Sita and gives her&nbsp; !2 months to consent to marry him.&nbsp;
Back in Panchavati, Rama questions Lakshmana the wisdom of leaving Sita alone.&nbsp; Rama
starts lamenting about the safety of Sita.&nbsp; When Rama finds Sita missing, he becomes
inconsolable in grief and Lakshmana assumes the role of&nbsp; Counselor and brings him
back to senses.&nbsp; They come across the dying Jatayu who brief&#146;s them on
Ravana&#146;s abduction of Sita.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord does last
rites of Jatayu with his own hands and gives him Moksha&nbsp; This shows how he had
compassion for even the birds &amp; beasts.</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We often heard
elders in the family say you can miss a wedding but never miss to comfort or do seva for
family that has lost a near or dear one.&nbsp; Never miss to do Seva in a family where
there is a death.</font> <br>
<font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never hesitate when
contributions are asked for performing&nbsp; &#145;Antim Samskara &#145;&nbsp; for
Helpless&nbsp; labourers or orphans.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">Back to Aranya Kanda, Rama tells Lakshmana
that&nbsp; death and sacrifice of Jatayu&nbsp; has driven the sorrow out of his
mind.&nbsp; As they proceeded in southern direction, Kabandha, a Gandarva in the form of
Rakhshasa by curse, captured them.&nbsp; Rama gave moksha to Kabandha and he guided them
to Rishyamukh Parvath&nbsp; and the ashram of&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabari.&nbsp; They arrive
in&nbsp; Mathangavana and meet Sabari.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabari, as a child gave up marriage,
when her mother told that all her pet birds would become feasts for guests.&nbsp; She
symbolizes the word &#145;Prateeksha &#150; patience in waiting&#146; &#150; Her Guru told
her that her Lord &#145;Rama will come, wait for Him&#146;.&nbsp; She waited for that day
and he did turn up.&nbsp; She served Rama and attained Brahmaloka.</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>The funny thing is we only want to wait
for Trains and Buses for tickets in queues for cinema halls and cricket matches.&nbsp; But
we don't wait for Lord.&nbsp; So how will he ever come, unless we genuinely wait for Him?</b></font>
</p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Comic Sans MS">This unique quality of Sabari made Rama feel
that meeting her was more important to him than meeting Sugreeva in the quest of
Sita.&nbsp; They start their journey towards Rishyamukha to meet the monkey King&nbsp;
Sugreeva that would bring in the great Rama Bakta - Shri Hanumanji who is a complete
person full of Wisdom, Valor, Viveka, Vinayam, Devotion, Courage and&nbsp; Seva into
Ramayana.</font> </p>
