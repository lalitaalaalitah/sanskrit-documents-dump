A short life sketch of Shri Appayya DikShita (1520-1593 AD)

Shrimad Appayya DikShita was born at Adayapalam village, very near
Arni, North Arcot District, Tamil Nadu in the year
1520 AD. His father Shri Rangarajadhari was the son of Shri Acharya
DikShita - also known as VakShasthalacharya who was in
the court of Shri Krishnadevaraya. ``Appayya'' was an
endearing form of his real name, Vinayaka Subramaniam.
``The 16th century AD, in South India was an age of confusion
when begotry and vigorous proselytism were rampant. Persecution 
of one sect by another with the help of the ruling dynasties
was quite common. In such an age, the need was felt for a
rare scholar with comprehensive vision and imagination, whose mission
in life would be the reconciliation of the various creeds,
cults and philosophies. Shri Appayya DikShita filled this essential
need. He was a peace maker who pleade for harmony, tolerance 
and mutual goodwill and understanding at a time when people were
quarrelling among themselves as to who was superior Vishnu or 
Shiva. (Dr. N. Ramesan IAS. Shri Appayya DikShita Page 3)
``DikShitar's culture was at once profound, libeal and wide. His
characteristic impartiality never failed him even in his out and
out militant works.'' (A. V. Gopalachariar. Introduction to
Varadarajastava 1927. P vI) DikShitar's learning, says Y. Mahalinga
Shastri, was in the truest sense of the word encyclopaedic. 

अप्पय्यदीक्षितेन्द्रा-नशेषविद्यागुरूनहं वन्दे । 
यत्कृतिबोधाबोधौ विद्वदविद्वद्विभाजकोपाधी ॥ (भट्टोजीदीक्षितः)

Shri DikShita is the author of not less than 104 works and had enjoyed
the patronage of King Chinna Bomma of Vellore. He
was offered ``kanakAbhiSheka'' by this king in 1582AD. He was
patronised by Chinna Thimma and Venkatapati also. He
lived upto the ripe age of 73 years and spent his last days in
Chidambaram.

Some of his most famous works are Shivarka maNidIpikA, NyAya
rakShAmaNI, siddhAnta lesha sa.ngraha, parimala, chAturmata
sArasa.ngraha, yAdavabhyudaya vyAkhyA, varadarAjastava and
kuvalayAnanda. His stotras are simple, popular and effective,
for example, mArgabandhu stotram, durgAchandrakalA stuti,
ApitakuchambA stava, hariharabheda stuti.

Margabandhu stotram: This small hymn is about Lord Marga sahaya or
Margabandhu of Virinchipuram, near Vellore,
NA Dt., the family deity of DikShita. It is very effective when
recited before and during journy to ward off accidents and
ensure success.
(The above life sketch is taken from the book Shrimad Appayya
DikShita, published by Shrimad Appayya DikShitendrar
Grantha Prakasana Samiti, Hyderabad.)

The following abbreviations are used in the commentary:  
(1) VS: Shri Vishnu Sahasranama stotram with Shri Shankara's bashyam. (2)
SS: Shiva Sahasranama stotram (called Vedasara
sahasram) from Padmapuranam with the commentary (published by Tanjore
Saraswati Mahal Library) of  HH Shri Paramasivendra Saraswati - 57th
pontiff of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam and the guru of the well known
saint composer Shri Sadasiva Brahmendra Saraswati . (3) BG: Bhagavat
Gita (4) BH: Shrimad Bhagavatam (5) KU: Kathopanishad. (6) MU:  
mundakopanishad (7)SVU: Svetasvatara upanishad. (8)TU:  
Taittriyopanishad. (9) SA: Shri Shivanama Ashtottara shata stotram from
Skandam with the commentary (called Shivatattva Rahasyam) of Shri
Neelakanta DikShita (grandson of Shri Appayya DikShita's younger
brother), a great scholar and poet in his own right.

मार्गः = a way, road, path; बन्धुः = relative or any one
associated, well wisher. So the word मार्गबन्धुः means one who
comes along with you giving company and protection स्तोत्रम् Stotram
is a hymn praising the Lord गुणसंकीर्तनात्मकं
स्तोत्रम् (VS681) It talks about His qualities.

Stotram: At this point it is relevant to say a few words about stotram. Our
scriptures are explicit in saying that the Supreme Being is one.
It is without name, form and any other attributes. It is called
brahman in our scriptures. This is not its name but one of its many
attributes बृहत्तमत्वात् That which is big is brahman. Since
the adjective `big' is used simply without a noun to be qualified it
implies that the bigness is unlimited. It is infinite and beyond
time, space etc., unlike the objects and beings we see in the
universe. The scriptures also aver that it is beyond our senses. The
famous mantra from the Taittiriyopanishad (Anu IV) says
that the brahman is beyond the reach of our mind and words यतो
वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह If so, how does a seeker
think of it or pray to it? This is where our scriptures come to our
help. They also describe the same God (who indeed is without a form
or name) as having many forms and names. This helps a seeker to
worship Him through prayers,  puja,
pilgrimages to holy places etc.. So we have gods like Rama, Shiva,
Durga etc.. The worship of the Lord with form and name is called
(सगुण उपासना ) saguna (sa = with; guna = attributes;
upAsanA = worship). The names and forms conceal the esoteric truths mentioned
in the upanishads. Thus they, like a map, give us some idea of
something which is very vast and cannot be grasped by our senses. The
Lord graciously accepts the worship offered to Him in any form one
may choose.
Krishna says
यो यो यां यां तनुं भक्तः श्रद्धयाऽर्चितुमिच्छति  ।
तस्य तस्याचलां श्रद्धां तामेव विदधाम्यहम् । BG.7-21 
He says that in whatever form a devotee seeks to worship Him with
faith He upholds that faith and makes it steady .
स तया श्रद्धया युक्तः तस्याराधनमीहते ।
लभते च ततः कामान् मयैव विहितान्हितान्। BG.7-22 .
He adds that the devotee engages himself with faith in the worship
(as said above)  and from that he obtains his
desires which are really conferred by Me alone. These statements of
the Lord lend validity and sanctity to the worship of God with name
and form who indeed is without any name, form or attributes. Later on
the Lord says
तेषां सततयुक्तानां भजतां प्रीतिपूर्वकम् ।
ददामि बुद्धिसंयोगं येन मामुपयान्ति ते। BG.10-10 .
He assures that to such devotees who worship Him with love He will
give the clear wisdom by which they will reach Him. In
this manner the saguna upAsana acts as a stepping stone to nirguna
upAsana and through that the realisation of God.

Prahlada, the gem among the devotees, mentions nine kinds of
devotion (BH .7-5-23).  The first two amongst these (viz.)
श्रवणम् listening to the Lord's names and stories which bring
out His glories and कीर्तनम् chanting them are the simplest and
easiest to practise. These can be done by anyone irrespective of age,
caste or gender. They are suitable for the
young and energetic as well as the old and decrepit, a pundit and
also the ignoramus. Thus they are suitable for all. It is possible that their very simplicity deceives one to imagine that they are
less potent than the other kinds of devotion. This is not so.
Our scriptures repeatedly assert that they can confer the highest
benefits on the devotee. The vedas contain stotras like the
Rudram, Shri suktam etc.. Our puranas contain many. In adddition our
acharyas like Shri Shankara and other saints have composed soul-stirring compositions in many languages. All these are
ideally suited for recitation.

One remarkable common feature to be found in these stotras is that
each one may be in praise of a differently named god like
Rama or Shiva. It will praise the attributes of that deity (in saguna
form). It will also refer to incidents to be found in the puranas.
The Bhagvat Gita says that the Lord incarnates Himself from time to
time to subdue the evil and protect the righteous people.
The puranas contain details of the incarnations and the deeds
performed by Him to fulfill His mission. Behind all the glorification they will refer to His nirguna (without attributes) aspect also.
The composition may be in praise of Shri Rama or Devi but it
will also talk of the God as the Supreme Being. This clearly shows
that the composer of the stotra was in fact praising the
formless reality using the form of Shri Rama or Devi as a front. We
can see this being done in this stotram also.

There is one more point to note regarding stotras. Poets have sung
praises of nobles and kings for pecuniary gains. But these men and
kings, howsoever great or rich they may be, are only human. They
have their limitations and weaknesses. In view of this a
poem in praise of a person has necessarily to overlook the subject's
foibles, exaggerate whatever virtues are to be found and if necessary
innovate virtues! Exactly opposite is the case with God. He is pure
and without limitations. As said earlier He is
beyond the reach of the mind and words. So those who have composed
stotrams in praise of the Lord have invariably felt
severely handicapped because of their own limitations. We find such
verses confessing the feelings of inadequacy even in the compositions
of great acharyas like Shri Shankara and Shri Vedanta Desika .

Now let us go to the Margabhandhu Stotram proper .
      शंभो महादेव देव शिव
      शंभो महादेव देवीश शंभो -
      शंभो महादेव देव ॥ 
The stotram begins with the recitation of the holy names of the Lord.
The recitation of the Lord's names purifies the mind,
makes it calm and fit for any serious undertaking. So they are
normally repeated before commencing any work like pooja,
religious discourse etc. Here one may recall the familiar verses
recited at the time of commencing puja or any religious ceremony .

अपवित्रः पवित्रो वा सर्वावस्थां गतोऽपि वा  ।
यः स्मरेत् पुण्डरीकाक्षं सः बाह्याभ्यन्तरः शुचिः । ।
मानसं वाचिकं पापं कर्मणा समुपार्जितम् ।
श्रीरामस्मरणेनैव व्यपोहति न संशयः । ।
श्री राम राम  राम ॥ 
These verses say ``Anyone - may be impure or pure or whatever
may be his condition - if just thinks of th lotus -eyed Lord is
certainly pure inside and out. Sins commited by mind, speech or
action go away by thinking of Shri Rama. This is
certain.''  Thus the chanting of the Lord's names flushes out the
impurities in the mind and invigorates it. The author can
then look to the successful completion of the work taken on hand - in
this case the composing of the hymn. Happily these
names may be taken to apply to both to Shiva and Vishnu. They may be
seen in the sahasranamams of both Shiva and Vishnu.

SHAMBHU शम्भुः । शं सुख़ं भावयतीति शंभुः (SS-74:  
VS-38) He blesses his devotees with happiness and prosperity शं
= happiness, prosperity. All being go through the repeated cycle of
birth and death. They experience varities of sufferings during each
life. During the dissolution of the universe He withdraws all beings
within Himself - out of mercy -  and after some time He releases them
again at the beginning of the next kalpa so that they get relief and
respite.

यतः सर्वाणि भूतानि भवन्त्यादियुगागमे। यस्मिंश्च
प्रलयं यान्ति पुनरेव युगक्षये। VS-11
``From whom all beings come at the beginning of the kalpa and
into whom they again merge at the end of the kalpa.'' This
implies that they are also sustained by Him during the period in
between. This is mentioned in the TU (3-1).

यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते येन जातानि जीवन्ति यत्
प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति 
``From whom all these beings emanate, by whom they stay alive and
into whom they merge after death.''

MAHADEVA महादेवः - महांश्चासौ देवश्च महादेवः । महत्वं
च सकलपूज्यत्वाद्वा विभुत्वेन प्रमाणतो महत्वाद्वा He is
worshipped by everyone. Also He is great because He pervades every
thing.(SS22) सर्वान् भावन् परित्यज्य आत्मज्ञानयोगैश्वर्ये महति
महीयते तस्मादुच्यते महादेवः (VS492)He is called Mahadeva
because of His superior knowledge and His greatness as the gretest of
the yogis. Shivarahasya says that the sound ``Mahadeva
Maha-deva'' is a divine medicine for those bitten by the serpent
called samsara महादेव महादेव महादेवेत्ययं ध्वनिः
संसारसर्प-दष्टानां दिव्यौषधमनुत्तमम्। 

DEVA देवः - स्वामिपर्यायो देवशब्दः, नरदेव इतिवत्।
अकुंचितस्वामित्वं च शिवस्यैव The word deva indicates
lordship. His lordship is unrestricted दिव्यतेर्देवः (SA93)
He is effulgent. Krishna says '' I am the splendour of those who
possess splendour,'' तेजस्तेजस्विनामहम् BG(10-36)
Accordingly, तमेव भान्तमनुभाति सर्वं तस्य भासा
सर्वमिदं विभाति KU(2-2-15). All these (the sun, the moon, the
stars, the lightning and fire) shine only after Him. It is with the
infinitesimal part of His luminosity that all these shine.

तेजोमूर्तिः SS413 and अमिततेजाः SS34 are His names. In the
course of teaching of Gita at KurukShetra, Arjuna requests Krishna  to
show him His cosmic form as Iswara. The gracious
Lord obliges and reveals His universal form. Arjuna is overwhelmed by
the splendour of the form he sees. He feels as though
a thousand suns had risen at once in the sky दिवि
सूर्यसहस्रस्य भवेद्युगपदुत्थिता। यदि भाः सदृशी सा
स्याद्भासस्तस्य महात्मनः । (BG 9-12). Here, as is usual with
the scriptures, thousand is only indicative and stands for many or
infinite. This is a popular verse and is said to have been quoted by
the scientist Oppenheimer to describe the explosion of the first atom
bomb which he witnessed.

Effulgence does not stand only for light. It also means wisdom. Shiva
stands for infinite knowledge यः सर्वज्ञः सर्ववित् MU(1-9)
One who is omniscient and knower of all द्युतिधरः  द्युतिं
ज्ञानलक्षणां दीप्तिं धारयतीति द्युतिधरः VS(275)He bears
the shine of knowledge दीप्तमूर्तिः दीप्ता ज्ञानमयी
मूर्तिर्यस्येति दीप्तमूर्तिः VS(719) He is of the form of shining
knowledge प्रकाशात्मा। प्रकाशस्वरूप आत्मा यस्य सः
प्रकाशात्मा VS(276) His form is effulgent knowledge.

SIVA शिवः - शिवः मङ्गलस्वरूपः ।
निर्मृष्ट निखिलदुःखानुषङ्गपरमानन्दरूप इत्यर्थः । 
Shiva is the personification of auspiciousness.
He is completely free from sorrows
that characterise all created beings including plants,
animals, birds, humans and devas like Indra and even Brahama the
creator. He is the embodiment of supreme bliss. (SS18)
Also निस्त्रैगुणतया शुद्धत्वात् शिवः (VS27)He is devoid of
the three qualities i.e. sattva(serenity), rajas(activity) and
tamas(inertia). These qualities constitute ignorance (of Brahman or
reality) and characterise all creation. So Shiva being free
from these is pure. Patanjali sums up all this in his Yogadarsana
(1-23) as क्लेशकर्मविपाकाशयैरपरामृष्टः
पुरुषविशेषः ईश्वरः । क्लेशाः, अविद्या, अस्मिता, राग,
द्वेष, अभिनिवेशा, कर्म धर्माधर्मौ, विपाकाः
कर्मफलानि - जन्मायुर्भोगाः, आशयो ज्ञानादि- वाशनाः,
एतैः कालत्रयेऽपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेषः ईश्वरः इत्यर्थः ॥

स्मृतिमात्रेण पावयन् शिवः He removes the sins of those who
just think of His name. DakShayani says this to her father
DakSha यद्व्यक्षरं नाम गिरेरितं नृणां सकृत्
प्रसंगादघमाशु हन्ति The celebrated two syllables SIVA
uttered with the tongue even once and that too casually, immediately
wipes off the sins of those (who utter them).(BH 4.4.13)
Shivarahasya says this about the sanctity of Lord Shiva's names:  

सर्वाणि शिवनामानि मोक्षदान्येव सर्वदा  ।
तेष्वप्यत्युत्तमं नाम शिवेति ब्रह्मसंज्ञितम्। All the
names of Shiva give mokSha no doubt. But amongst them the name
Shiva is the best and denominates brahman. The
name Shiva is considered as the best among the Lord's names .

विद्यासु श्रुतिरुत्कृष्टा रुद्रैकादशनी श्रुतौ ।
तत्र पञ्चाक्षरी तस्यां शिव इत्यक्षरद्वयम्। 
Of all the knowledge the vedas are superior. Among the vedas Shri
Rudram that consists of sixteen chapters is superior. In that
the PanchakShari is superior. In that also the two letters SIVA are
the best. The glory of the Lord's names is  dealt with in great
detail in Puranas and hymns of the saints.

DEVESHA देवेशः - प्राधान्येन देवानामीशः देवेशः He is
the foremost among the gods like Indra, Agni etc.. VS(492) सुरेशः
- सुराणां देवानामीशः सुरेशः He is the lord of the
devas. VS(85). He rules with a firm hand. None can dare to transgress
His commandments without facing serious consequences .

भीषास्मात् वातः पवते। भीषोदेति सूर्यः ।
भीषास्मादग्निश्चेन्द्रश्च । मृउत्युर्धावति पञ्चमः 
TU(VII-1) It is for fear of Him that the wind blows; the sun rises;
the fire and  Indra perform their duties. It is for fear of Him
that death the fifth runs about doing his work with diligence. The
same is said by none other than Yama, the lord of death:  

भयादस्याग्निस्तपति भयात् तपति सूर्यः  ।
भयादिन्द्रश्च वायुश्च मृत्युर्धावति पञ्चमः । KU(3-3).

Now let us go to the stotram proper. It consists of five verses and a
sixth one - called फलश्रुतिः that gives the benefit of
reciting the hymn. In this hymn Lord Margabandhu is described as the
God with form as Shiva  bearing weapons, as the
consort of Parvati. It refers to various incidents to be found in
puranas that reveal His unrivalled power and glory. He is also
praised in His aspect as the supreme reality, the attributeless
brahman whose nature is existence, wisdom and bliss .

      १. फालावनम्रत्किरीटं फालनेत्रार्चिषा दग्धपञ्चेषुकीटम्  ।
      शूलाहतारातिकूटं, शुद्धमर्धेन्दुचूडं भजे मार्गबन्धुम्॥

      शंभो ...
फालः - forehead; अवनम्र - descended or come down;
किरीटं - crown: indicates that Lord Shiva wears a crown on the
head किरीटी - किरीटमस्यास्तीति किरीटी (SS782). The crown implies
that Shiva wears other ornaments also हिरण्यः (SS273) and
हिरण्यबाहुः (SS387) सुवर्णवर्णः -सुवर्णस्येव वर्णोऽस्येति
सुवर्णवर्णः VS(737). One who is golden-hued and हेमाङ्गः -
हेमेवाङ्गं वपुरसेति हेमाङ्गः VS(738) One with body like gold
are also His names. Shri Rudram salutes Him saying नमो
हिरण्यबाहवे।
पादावनम्रत्किरीटं is another reading found in some
books पादः = foot; implies that when gods like Indra bow down
to salute Him their crowns touch His feet. The crown indicates
lordship. Please see the comments on DEVESHA above.  He demands
respect and in fact He is the only one to be respected पूज्यः ।
पूजायोग्यः पूज्यः सर्ववन्द्य: इत्यर्थः SS(70) He deserves to
be worshipped by all. There is none equal to or greater than Him says
Shri Suka while saluting Him before he begins to narrate Bhagavatam to
King ParikShit निरस्तसाम्यातिशयेन राधसा स्वधामनि
ब्रह्मणि रंस्यते नमः BH(2-4-14)अतुलः - तुलोपमानमस्य
न विद्यते इति अतुलः He has none equal to Him. VS(355)
अनुत्तमः - अविद्यमान उत्तमो यस्मात् सः अनुत्तमः There is
none greater than Him. VS (80). Further
there is none superior to Him. VS(626) अनीशः - न
विद्यतेऽस्येश इति अनीशः 
All other devas including Brahma the creator are limited by time and
are subject to sorrows प्रथमः - देवानां प्रधानभूत आद्यो
वा प्रथमः He is the first and foremost among the devas.
SS(111). Shri Rudram says He is the foremost and is the inner self of
the devas प्रथमो दैव्यः Such is His glory 

फालनेत्रार्चिषा दग्धपञ्चेषुकीटं - नेत्रं = eye:  
अर्चिस् = fire: दग्ध = burnt: इषुः = arrow: कीटः = a
worm, insect पञ्चेषुः is the name  Manmatha, the god of
love, because he has five arrows: they are अरविन्दं, अशोकं,
चूतं, नवमल्लिका and नीलोत्पलम्(lotus, ashoka, mango,
jasmine and blue lotus). The five arrows are also said to be
संमोहनः , उन्मादनः, शोषणः, तापनः and 
स्तम्भनः They are fascination, intoxication or extravagance of
love, emaciation, suffering pain and benumbing or stupifying
respectively. Kalidasa vividly narrates the story connected with Shiva
destroying the god of love in his mastepiece Kumarasambhavam.
Manmatha shot his arrow संमोहनं at Shiva who was deep in
meditation. He wanted to seduce Shiva's mind and make Him fall in love
with Parvati who was attending on Him, but failed in his attempt.
Shiva could sense that something was amiss and looked about. He saw
Manmatha cowering at a distnce. He just knit his brows in annoyance.
In that moment fire shot out of His third eye and
reduced the wretched Manmatha into a handful of ashes. Manmatha is
contemptuously termed a worm or insect as he
was foolish enough to try his tricks on none other than the great
Shiva. So Shiva is known as कामारिः - कामस्य मन्मथस्य अरिः
कामारिः SA(25)

Leaving the story apart, the implication is that there is no place
for carnal desires in the prescence of the Lord; just like there is
no place for darkness in the prescence of the sun. By the same
logic,there will be no place for evil tendencies in the heart of a
devotee who establishes the Lord therein.

Shiva's third eye is situated in His forehead. So Shiva is known as
फालनेत्रः SS(159) and ललाटाक्षः SA(28) It is to be
noted that the third eye is unique. None of the human beings and gods
including Indra and the creator Brahma possess such
an eye. So Shiva is also known as विरूपक्षः । विरूपाणि
विरुद्धस्वरूपाणि लोकविरुद्धत्रित्वविशिष्टानि अक्षीणि यस्य सः
विरूपाक्षः । SS(129).  He has an abnormal third eye. The third
eye situated in a high position (viz) forehead and stands for supreme
knowledge उन्नतस्थानवर्तिलोचनशालित्वकीर्तनेन
विश्वोत्तरज्ञानशालित्वं सूचितम् SA(28). With such an eye He
could easily look into the inmost recesses of anyone's heart and  see
the thoughts lurking there. So He could detect by a mere glance  that
the god of love has come to His prescence with an evil thought and
meted out severe punishment.

The Shiva-Mahimna stotram (15) says that for his foolishness Manmatha
paid a heavy price with his life and became an
object of memory स्मरः स्मर्तव्यात्मा न हि वशिषु पथ्यः
परिभवः । स्मर Smara is another name of Manmatha. His arrows
have not failed anywher in the world of gods, demons and men. So he
became conceited. Smara  became (स्मर्तव्यात्मा) an object of
memory. The moral of the story, says the poem, is that an insult to
the great will
produce serious consequences वन्हिनेत्रः - वन्हिनेत्रं ललाटे
यस्य सः वन्हिनेत्रः (SS131) is also one of Shiva's names.
Bhartrihari in his Vairagya Satakam refers to this incident thus:  
लीलादग्ध-विलूलकाम शलभः (i.e.) who effortlessly burnt
up the flippant god of love as a moth. A big fire instantly reduces
a moth into ashes.

शूलः = the Trident of Shiva; आहत = struck; अरातिः = enemy; 
कूटं = mass, heap: Shiva has destroyed His enemies with
His Trident. But Shiva has no enemies समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु न मे
द्वेष्योऽस्ति न प्रियः (BG9-29) ``I am the same to all beings.
There is none hateful or dear to me'' says the Lord in Gita. So
we have to take  ``enemies'' to mean the enemies of His
devotees. We find that during the Mahabharata war Lord involved
Himself to help His devotee Arjuna. During the KurukShetra war Arjuna
was struk with wonder to see a figure radiant like the sun  going
ahead of him. The figure destroyed
his enemies very easily with His trident. Arjuna tells this to sage
Vyasa and asks who that radiant figure was. He adds that
people think he has killed his enemies so valiantly though all the
work was done by that figure. Vyasa says ``You have seen
Lord Shiva.'' ईशानमीश्वरं देवं दृष्टवानसि
शङ्करम् Krishna confirms this and says ``Your enemies have
already been killed by Me. Be a mere instrument.'' BG(11-33)
मयैवैते निहिताः पूर्वमेव निमित्तमात्रं भव
सव्यसाचिन् 

The more dangerous ``enemies'' a devotee has to face are
internal such as desire, anger etc.. In reply to Arjuna's question as
to
what impels a person to commit sins even though he may be unwilling,
Krishna says काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भवः । महाशनो
महापाप्मा विद्ध्येनमिह वैरिणम्। BG(3-37) ``It is desire.
It is  anger. They are born out of rajo guna. It has huge appetite
and makes one to commit sins. Recognise it as your enemy.'' And
later on BG(16-21)
He describes these as open gateways to hell that will destroy the
self. He cautions Arjuna to be careful and avoid them. So a devotee  in order to avoid these internal enemies installs Him in his heart
and feels safe. Krishna tells Uddhava that once He
is established in the heart evil tendencies like desires get
destroyed कामा हृदय्या नश्यन्ति सर्वे मयि हृदि स्थिते BH(11-21-26).
They cannot live together like light and darkness.  He
is called कामहा - कामान् हन्ति मुमुक्षूणां भक्तानां
हिंसकानां चेति कामहा He destroys the desires of His
devoteees who seek liberation and the
intentions of those who trouble them. VS(294). Also कामनाशः ।
मुमुक्षूणां कामं नाशयतीति कामनाशः SS(126). Lord
Shiva is the आदि गुरुः the earliest or the first guru. He teaches
by demonstration. He shows He has destroyed His desires and wants His
devotee to do likewise. He is only too willing to help him provided he
makes his heart His temple. In view of this Bhartruhari describes a
sadhu whose heart is pure as having devotion to Shiva with trident
भक्तिः शूलिनि 

Unfortunately a devotee has to contend with one more
``enemy'' - more pernicious than the enemies mentioned in the
preceding
para. It is attachment. Desire is a longing to possess something
which we do not have and we feel that thing can give us satis faction or pleasure or security. We try to get that thing and when
someone or something thwarts the desire the desire turns into anger.
Thus desire precedes anger or anger is the result of frustrated
desire. Once the object of desire is got and is in our possession we
tend to hold on to it. This inclination to bind ourselves to objects
or people around us is known as attachment.
We look to those objects or people to give us pleasure or security.
Vedanta warns us to avoid getting attached to things or
people; because firstly the objects of attachment are perishable as
anything in the world is. If we develop strong attachment to
something, then parting with it can be a very painful experience and
we may sink under the load of the resultant grief. That was the case
with Dasaratha who was excessively attached to his son Rama. He could
not bear the pangs of separation from Rama
who had to leave for the forest for fourteen years. He died in agony.

Secondly it is wrong to look to such objects or people for security
as they are perishable and so are themselves insecure.
Hence they cannot confer security on us. We will be left in the
lurch. Attachment is called (ईषणा ) IshanA. Three types of
attachments are mentioned in our scriptures. They are attachment to
(1) the money (2) wife/husband and (3) children. Further
it is said that attachment, once developed to something, is very
difficult to get rid of. It is like a blob of coaltar that has some how got stuck to our body. It will take a long time and repeated
washing to get rid of it. So we are warned to be wary of
developing attachment to anything or any person. This does not
prevent us from showing love to others.

Prahlada gives a description of these attachments (BH .7-6) in his
advice to his friends. Talking about the attachment to money
he says को न्वर्थतृष्णां विसृजेत् प्राणेभ्योऽपि य ईप्सितः ।
यं क्रीणात्यसुभिः प्रेष्ठैस्तस्करः सेवको वणिक्। (BH
97-8-10) He says that money is valued higher than life itself and so
who can give up attachment to it? The thief, the soldier and the
merchant trade their dear life for money. In view of this he warns
all to stay away from the objects of attachment and seek the Lord.
The boy Nachiketa said न वित्तेन तर्पणीयो मनुष्यः He said
man can never get satiated with the wealth  when Yama offered him
immense wealth in exchange for the teaching about self.

Kunti, the mother of Pandavas, in her prayer to Krishna before He
leaves for Dwaraka says स्नेहपाशमिमं छिन्धि दृढं
पाण्डुषु वृष्णिषु। She prays to the Lord to cut her attachment
to her relatives so that her mind can think of Him without
distractions. BH(1-8-41)

The foregoing introduction is to explain the other implication of
shula or the trident of Shiva. The three sharp points of the trident
can destroy the three kinds of attachment that can assail a devotee
and hinder his progress.

The devotee shakes off his attachments to the worldly objects first.
This was what Vibhishana did before surrendering to
Rama. As the brother of Ravana and his minister he was very
powerful. He was immensely rich. He had palaces, loving wives
and children. But he gave up every thing and rushed to Rama without
even taking leave of his wife and children. He said त्यक्त्वा
पुत्रांश्च दारांश्च राघवं शरणं गतः Renouncing
my wives and children I have surrendered to Raghava and again 
परिक्त्यक्ता मया लङ्का मित्राणि च धनानि च Lanka,
friends and all wealth had been left behind by me.
(Ramayana-Yuddhakanda-17-16 and 19-6).
Then he transfers his  attachment to the Lord and enshrines Him in
his heart. Then the devotee ties His feet firmly with the cord
of love and so He becomes immobilised प्रणयरशनया
धृथाङ्घ्रिपद्मः BH(11-2-55). Thus firmly stationed in the
devotee's heart He destroys the evil tendencies therein
हृद्यन्तस्थो ह्यभद्राणि विधुनोति सुहृत्सताम् BH(1-2-17)
शूलहस्तः - शूलं हस्ते यस्य  सः (SS114): जितशत्रुः -
जिताः शत्रवः येन सः जितशत्रुः (SS211) and रिपुघ्नः -
सुररिपून् हन्तीति रिपुघ्नः (SS370) are Shiva's names.

Further it is said त्रैगुण्यं शूलमेतस्य - एवं भूतस्य
शूलस्य करस्थत्वोक्त्या त्रिगुणात्मिकाया मायाया
स्वाधीनत्वमुक्तं भवति SA(11) The trident represents the
three gunas (traits). Shiva holding it in His hand shows He is in
contol of maya of which they are the constituents.

शुद्धं = कालत्रयेऽपि परमार्थतः मायाऽविद्यादि
संबन्धरहितः शुद्धः । शुद्धमपापविद्धं इति
श्रुतिः (SS310) Forever He is free from maya (the illusion by which
one considers the unreal universe as really existent and as distinct
from the Supreme Spirit) and spiritual ignorance. This is made
explicit by what is said about the moon next.

अर्धेन्दुचूडं - अर्ध = half इन्दुः = the moon चूड = crest,
Shiva has partial moon on the crest सोमविभूषः -
विशिष्टा भूषा विभूषा, सोमः विभूषा भूषणं यस्य सः
सोमविभूषः चन्द्रधरः (SS32) and also शशिमौलिः = 
शशी चन्द्रः मौलौ यस्य सः शशिमौलिः (SS929)The moon
appears as a  special ornament to Shiva शशिशेखरः - अयं
चन्द्रः परमेश्वरस्य ज्ञानरूप इति शिवागमे
दर्शितम्।यतोक्तं `` ज्ञानचन्द्रकलाचूडं।'' SA(5).
The moon represents His infinite wisdom. Please see notes under Deva
above. It is to be noted that the crown  that Shiva wears does not
cover the moon. This implies that Shiva's lordship
over the universe - His omnipotence - does not veil His wisdom. The
shining moon announces to the world that one who
yearns for knowledge should come to Him. Shankaracharya says in his
Prasnottara ratnamalika को हि जगद्गुरुरुरुक्तः? शंभुः,
ज्ञानं कुतः? शिवादेव। Who is the universal teacher? Shambu.
From where  can one get wisdom? From Shiva only. So we have the saying
ज्ञानमिच्छेत् महेश्वरात् '' One should pray to Maheswara
for wisdom.''

भजे =  worship: मार्गबन्धुं = the Lord Margabandu.
I worship Lord Margabandu who wears a crown, who destroyed the insect
like god of love with the fire from His eye in His
forehead, who destroyed  the enemies (of gods) with His Trident, who
is pure(i.e.) beyond maya and ignorance and who
wears the moon on His head as an onament.

      २. अङ्गे विराजद्भुजङ्गं
      अभ्रगङ्गातरङ्गाभिरामोत्तमाङ्गं
      ओंकारवाटीकुरङ्गं सिद्धसंसेविताङ्घ्रिं
      भजे मार्गबन्धुम् । शंभो ...
अङ्गे विराजद्भुजङ्गं   -
अंगं = limb; may mean hand, or leg; विराजत् = shining or
appearing prominently; भुजंगः = serpent, snake;
Lord Shiva is decked with snakes सर्पभूषः - सर्पाः भुजगाः
भूषाः भूषणानि यस्य सः सर्पभूषः (SS43) His other names
are सर्पहारः: सर्पाः नागाः, ते हाराः यस्य सः (SS494)
and नागचूडः - नागो वासुकिः कोटीरबन्धनार्थं चूडायां
यस्य सः नागचूडः (SS736). Shiva wears a garland of snakes and
has tied Vasuki -the king of snakes - around His head to keep His
locks of hair in place.

Snakes:-
We fear snakes because we identify them with death. And everyone is
afraid of death कस्माद्भ्यमिह? मरणात् says
Sankaracharya in his Prasnottara ratnamalika. The symbolism is used
in our scriptures frequently. For example: ग्रस्तं
कालाहिनाऽऽत्मानं कोऽन्यस्त्रातुमधीश्वरः BH(11.8.41)
meaning ``who else, other than the Lord can save  one seized by
the serpent of Time ? When Gajendra, the lord of the elephants was
seized by a crocodile and found that he could
not extricate himself from its grip he called the Lord saying
यः कश्चनेशो बलिनोऽन्तकोरगात् प्रचण्डवेगादभिधावतो भृशम् ।
भीतं प्रपन्नं परिपाति यद्भयान्मृत्युः प्रधावत्यरणं तमीमहि। BH(8.2.33) 
He says ``Whosoever be the almighty God, who protects one, who has
surrendered to Him being very much afraid of  the
powerful snake in the form of Death - that is very fast and is after
him - and from fear of whom Death  himself runs hither and
thither, let us seek Him as our refuge.''

Kala means the Supreme principle which devours everything and Yama
the god of death who is also known by the names
Antaka and Mrutyu. So at level one He is Yama मृत्युः
सर्वहरश्चाहम् Krishna says ``I am Death who seizes all
life.'' BG(10.34)  He is Antaka अन्तकः - अन्तं करोति
भूतानामिति अन्तकः VS(520). He causes the end of all life.
At the higher level He is the kala or Supreme principle which
destroys everything including Yama, the god of death at the time of
dissolution. Lord Kapila gives a description of Kala to His mother
Devahuti. BH(3.29. 36-45). He says it is none other than
Vishnu who draws everything into Himself कालः - कलयति
सर्वमिति कालः, - कालः कलयतामहम् - गीता १०.३० इति
भगवद्वचनात् VS(418) and SS(33). The Lord is not limited by
time or space or by any material अनन्तात्मा। देशतः कालतो
वस्तुतश्चापरिच्छिन्नत्वात् अनन्तात्मा VS(518). He is not
subject to destruction or anything that causes destruction.
अमृत्युः । मृत्युर्विनाशः तद्धेतुर्वास्य न विद्यते इति
अमृत्युः VS(198). In fact it is He - the seer and all knowing  who had created the gods (including Yama) and assigned to them their
duties says Isavasyopanishad.
कविर्मनीषी परिभूः स्वयंभूः
यथातथ्यतोऽर्थान्व्यदधाच्छाश्वतीभ्यः समाभ्यः 
So the snakes, representing kala or death, cannot harm Him but He
wears them implying He uses Death for His services.
Yama himself says मृत्युर्यस्योपसेचनम् Death to Him is like
pickles or achAr - a thing He uses in the process of consumig the
creation. KU(1.3.25). Remember that one uses a small quantity of pickle
only to push in a large amount of food
- the main dish. Similarly the Lord uses the services of Yama in a
small measure for His main work.
कालहन्ता। कालस्य मृत्योर्हन्ता SS(83) and कालकालः ।
कालः यमः, तस्यापि कालः, . SA(29) are His names. He
destroyed even Yama, the god of death to protect His devotee
Markandeya. The name also indicates that He is the supreme Lord who
withdraws everything , the entire creation, including the god of
death into Himself at the time of dissoluton
and releases them again at the beginning of the next cycle of
creation. His other names are मृत्युंजयः - मृत्युः मरणं
स्वभक्तानां मृत्युं जयति, स्वोपासनादिना परिहरति इति
मृत्युंजयः SS(123), SA(71). He removes or avoids the death of
His devotees. The sage Markandeya confidently sings
चन्द्रशेखरमाश्रये मम किं करिष्यति वै यमः ``I
take refuge in Lord Shiva . What harm can Yama do to me?'' This is
also said symbolically in the story of Dhruva. Towards the end of
the story it is said that a chariot came to take him to the place
reserved for him in the skies. The Lord had told him that it was a
special place because there will be no return to this world again
meaning he had crossed death and will not be reborn. At that time
Yama - the god of death - approached him and bowed down. Dhruva
stepped on Yama's head and climbed into the vehicle .
तदोत्तानपादः पुत्रो ददर्शान्तिकमागतम् ।
मृत्यो-र्मूर्ध्नि पदं दत्त्वा आरुरोहाद्भुतं गृहम्। BH(4.12.30)

At this point let us take a small detour and see what our scriptures
have to say on the subject of life and kala or death.  This
may sound a bit morbid : but since it is literally a matter of life
and death we should know some details.

One who is born has to die and one who dies is reborn जातस्य हि
ध्रुवो मृत्युः ध्र्वं जन्म मृतस्य च BG(2.27).
From this it appears that this is a never ending process. One can
view it in either of the two ways as follows.
1 - One does not believe in the existence of the other world. There
is no inclination to think about or enquire into the process.
Such people are known as Nastikas.
2 - This one - known as Astika - believes in the shastras and the
existence of the other world. He tries to find a way out of it.

The shastras say that the people coming under the first category are
to be pitied. The human birth is superior to other forms of births.
Only humans are endowed with free will and ability to discriminate
between the right and the wrong: the good and the
bad. Only they have the ability to work for their own and other's
uplift. The animals do not have free will. Their life is governed
by instincts. Because of this they do not incur any sin for their
actions. One obtains a human birth after going through the
inferior births and as a result of some good deeds and blessings of
the Lord. It is therefore incumbent on us to use this
privileged position to our advantage and seek higher goals including
liberation from death. But if one fails to seize the rare
opportunity that has come his way but fritters his life on petty
sense pleasures and garnering pelf he falls from his status and
is considered an ignoramus.  BH(11.7.74)
    यः प्राप्य मानुषं लोकं मुक्तिद्वारमपावृतम्।
गृहेषु खगवत्सक्तस्तमारूढच्युतं विदुः । 

The question of escaping death has been discussed again and again in
our scriptures. We will structure the discussion as
answers to the following questions.
1 - What leads to rebirth?
2 - What is wrong with rebirth or why rebirth is to be avoided?
3 - What is the process called death? and
4 - Can death be avoided and if so how to avoid death?

1 - What leads to rebirth?
Everyone has to work, at least to keep the wolf from the door. In
addditon people work to improve their standard of living, to
provide for the rainy day, old age etc. All these activities - called
karma - can be classified as good or bad. The good ones are
those that are enjoined by our scriptures and those that can be
called virtuous, selfless and such. The bad ones are those that
are prohibited by our scriptures and those that are motivated by
greed, anger, selfishness etc. Both acts produce results which
are to be ``enjoyed'' by the doer .
स्वकर्मणोऽनुरूपं हि फलं भुञ्जति जन्तवः  ।
शुभेन कर्मणा भूतिर्दुःखं स्यात्पातकेन तु। Skanda Puranam.
The good deeds produce happiness, prosperity etc. and lead to higher
births - life of better quality and happiness in
this world or higher worlds. The bad deeds produce unhappiness,
misery etc.  By neglecting to do the duties expected of him
and also doing acts that are prohibited he falls and is thrown into
inferior births.
 विहितस्याननुष्ठानात् निन्दितस्य च सेवनात्।
अनिग्रहाच्चेन्द्रियाणां नरः पतनमृच्छति। (Yagnavalkya
Smrithi) Then he climbs up the ladder slowly and gets the human birth
again after a long time says Lord as Kapila to His mother Devahuti.
अधस्तान्नरलोकस्य यावतीर्यातनादयः । क्रमशः
समनुक्रम्य पुनरत्राव्रजेच्छुचिः । BH(3.31.34)
Yama - the god of death - tells the same to Nachiketa: ``One who
is infatuated with wealth; not having a thought for the other
world; such an ignorant person believing there is no such thing as
hell or heaven comes within my clutches again and again.''
न साम्परायः प्रतिभाति बालं प्रमाद्यन्तं वित्तमोहेन मूढम् ।
अयं लोको नास्ति पर इति मानी पुनः पुनर्वशमापद्यते मे। KU(1.2.6) 
So the doer of the deeds has to be prepared to enjoy or suffer the
fruits. If the fruits cannot be exhausted in one lifetime one
has to take another birth and try to exhaust them.
The problem, according to our shastras is, that everyone of us had
taken countless number of births, done karmas in these
births and accumulated vast amounts of the karmas. This accumulated
store waiting to bear fruit
is called संचितं कर्मा sanchitam karma.
In addition we continue to do karma in this life
also and add to the stock of sanchitam karma thus necessi tating more and more births. Out of this vast stock a chunk begins to
yield the results. This chunk is called प्रारब्धम् prarabdham.
There is no escape from the results of the prarabdham. It determines
the duration of life, the wealth, education
and the mode of death even as one is born आयुः कर्म च वित्तं
च विद्या निधनमेव च। पञ्चैतानि विविच्यन्ते जायमानस्य
देहिनः । We have to infer the impressions of the past deeds only
when we are confronted with the results. Kalidasa says this  in
Raghuvamsa (1.20) फलानुमेयाः प्रारंभाः संस्काराः
प्राक्तना इव 

2 - What is wrong with rebirth or why rebirth is to be avoided?
If one asks what is wrong with being born, saints like Shri Shankara
want us to think and find out if anything is right with it?किं
संसारे सारं ? बहुशोपि विचिन्त्यमानमिदमेव(Prasnottara
ratnamalika). If one were to think that Shankara  was a sanyasi and so
had such a dark view of life, so did Bhartruhari and Kulasheakhara who
were  kings and had access to all kinds of pleasures न
संसारोत्पन्नं चरितमनुपश्यामि कुशलं (Bhartruhari Vairagya Shatakam).

The problems start right from the beginning. Sage Kapila points out
that nothing can equal the pain one suffers while in the
womb गर्भवाससमं दुःखं न भूतं न भविष्यति BH(3.31.9).
Then look at the troubles one goes through as he
grows up. As one runs around earning and looking after his family one
is  assailed by worries and sickness. He is all the time  growing old
imperceptibly.
व्याघ्रीव तिष्ठति जरा परितर्जयन्ती, रोगाश्च शत्रव
इव प्रहरन्ति देहम् says Bartruhari in his Vairagya shatakam. He says that old age is crouching there like a tigress
frightening us, and diseases attack our bodies like enemies.
Then there is the fear of the inevitable death. In view of all these
Krishna describes rebirth as the seat of pain and impermanent.
पुनर्जन्म दुःखालयमशाश्वतम् BG(7.15) Later on He again
says this world is impermanent and joyless अनित्यमसुखं
लोकमिमं BG(9.33). We clearly see that everything in this world
is impermanent. This includes our bodies, our relations, friends and
possessions. The question then is how can one feel happy when thrown
into such a situation? Time is constantly gnawing at our life
quietly. Bhartruhari says life is oozing away like water leaking from
a pot with a crack आयुः परिस्रवति भिन्नघटादिवांभः 
Death is imminent and can strike anyone at any time. This being the
case, Krishna asks ``how can one find pleasure in wealth or
enjoyment? It cannot please him, who like an animal, is being dragged
to be slaughtered.''
BH(11.10. 20)कोन्वर्तः सुखयत्येनं कामो वा मृत्युरन्तिके।
आघातं नीयमानस्य वध्यसेव न तुष्टिदः । 
Next, Krishna said this world is joyless. This is because the
pleasures are transitory. They have a beginning and an end and so
are fleeting by nature. Their departure may leave a void and a trail
of sorrow. Or they may make one to hanker for more of it
and leave him restless and unhappy. So He says that one endowed with
discrimination will not enjoy them ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगाः
दुःखयोनय एव ते । आद्यन्तवन्तः कौन्तेय न
तेषु रमते बुधः । BG(9.22) Such sensory
pleasures are trivial and cannot be termed as
pleasures in the true sense.

In view of what is stated here, rebirth is not desireable and one
should, if possible, avoid it.

3 - What is the process called death?
This is mentioned briefly in clinical fashion in the
Brihadaranyopanishad. It says that as the end approaches the
individual's
breathing becomes hard and he starts gasping. His pranas, along with
the sense organs, withdraw from their respective foci and
gather around jivatma - the individual soul. As he (jiva) departs,
the pranas and the sense organs follow him. He gets a body as
in a dream and enters another body. The impressions of his karma and
the knowledge about brahman that he had acquired in
that birth also follow him. He gets a body suitable to his karma in
this world or some other world .
एवमेवात्मानमन्तकाले सर्वे प्रणाः अभिसमायान्ति
यत्रैतदूर्ध्व्वोच्छ्वासी भवति। (4.3.38)
तमुत्क्रामन्तं प्राणोऽनूत्क्रामति प्राणमनूत्क्रामन्तं
सर्वे प्राणा अनूत्क्रामन्ति सविज्ञानो भवति 
सविज्ञा मेवान्ववक्रामति तं विद्याकर्माणि समन्वारभेते पूर्वप्रज्ञा च। (4.4.2)
 अयमात्मेदं शरीरं निहत्याविद्यां
गमयित्वान्यन्नवतरं कल्याणतरं रूपं कुरुते(4.4.4)
Krishna says that the knowledge he had aquired in the earlier birth
carries him forward in his next birth and he progresses in
the spiritual path. He does not have to start ab initio.
पूर्वाभ्यासेन तेनैव ह्रियते ह्यवसोऽपि सः BG(6.44)
Some puranas describe it in detail making it sound a bit scary. Sage
Kapila gives a description in His talk to His mother. This
is on the same lines as stated above in the upanishad. He says that
the individual soul living in the gross body has, in addition, a subtle
body called Linga Shariram or SukShma Sariram which is invisible. It
is made up of seventeen components (viz.) the five sense organs of
perception (called gnanendriyas), the five sense organs of action
(called karmendriyas), the five pranas, the
mind and the intellect. It requires the gross physical body for
functioning. It does not perish when the gross body perishes in
the process called death which takes place at the end of prarabdham
karma. The Jiva just migrates to another body (called
birth) with the Linga Shariram according to the nature of past karmas
and generates new karmas which add on to the sanchitam karma and becomes the seed for future births.

4 - Can death be avoided and if so how to avoid death?
Luckily there is a way to escape death and the birth that follows.
Krishna says ``on reaching Me there is no rebirth.''
मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते BG(8.16) The question,
now is: '' where is He? and how to reach Him?'' The answer to
these questions form the main topic of discussions in our scriptures
like Gita, Upanishads and puranas like Shri Bhagavatam and is
beyond the scope of this essay and so is not attempted. One has to
learn it from a qualified teacher.

अभ्रगंगातरंगाभिरामोत्तमांङ्गं   - 
अभ्रं = sky; गंगा = the river Ganges. So the word
अभ्रगंंगा means the heavenly river Ganges; तरंगः = wave;
अभिरामः = pleasing, charming; उत्तम = best; The
word उत्तमांगं indicates the best limb in the body viz. the
head; This says that Shiva looks charming with the waves of the divine
river Ganges on His head गंगाधरः - धरतीति धरः ।
गङ्गायाः धरः इति गङ्गाधरः (SS146) and SA(27). Also
धूर्जटिः - धूः गङ्गा जटासु यस्य सः धूर्जटिः । नमः
कपर्दिने इति श्रुतिः (SS286)जटार्द्रः - जटसु
कपर्दनामिकासु गङ्गाप्रयुक्तमार्द्रं यस्य सः (SS797).

The river Ganges was, according to our scriptures, originally flowing
in the heavens. The story of Lord Vishnu's incarnation
and His seeking three feet of land from the king Bali is familiar to
all. When He lifted up His foot to measure the heavens,
Brahma the creator, seized the rare opportunity and washed the holy
foot of the Lord that has come his way with water from
his water pot. The waters became the holy river Ganga. 
धातुः कमंडलुजलं तदुरुक्रमस्य पादावनेजन-पवित्रतया नरेन्द्र ।
स्वर्धुन्यभून्नभसि सा पतती निमार्ष्टि लोकत्रयं भगवतो
विशदेव कीर्तिः । BH(8.21.4)
The story of the descent of Ganga to earth is also familiar. It is
mentioned briefly in Bhagavata in skanda 4 - chapter 17 and
skanda 9 - chapter 9. It is given in detail in the Balakanda of
Ramayana. Sage Viswamitra narrated it to Rama and LakShmana as
he was taking them to Mithila after he had successfully completed his
sacrifice with protection offered by the brothers. King Bhagirata - a
scion of the ikShvAku dynasty to which Rama belonged - was
instrumental in bringing the river to earth by performing severe penance. At his request Shiva received the mighty flow
of Ganga falling from the heavens and released it as a
stream on the earth. A large gathering comprising the residents of
the higher worlds and great seers came to witness the wonderful event. They, along with the people of this world, praised the
waters of the river Ganga as pure because of its contact
with Lord Shiva भवाङ्ग पतितं तोयं पवित्रमिति
पस्पृशुः (1.43.28).
Hence the saying काश्यां तु मरणान्मुक्तिः (ie.) death in
Kasi, now known as Varanasi, brings about salvation.
King ParikShit decided to spend the last seven days of his life at
the banks of the river because of this reason कस्तां न सेवेत
मरिष्यमाणः । BH(1.19.6) It asks ``which dying man will not
resort to such a holy river?''

Ganga:-
Now let us get behind the story of Ganga and see what it means.
Brahma to whom Bhagirata prays blesses his efforts. But He cautions
the king that he should pray to Lord Shiva and involve  Him in this
matter because the earth cannot withstand the fall
of Ganga from the heavens. He adds that no one other than Lord Shiva
is capable of receiving the torrent from the heaven. This
is because Brahma knows that Shiva is firm and unshakeable.
स्थाणुः । स्थिरत्वात् (VS 28). Also SA(72) स्थाणुः वृक्षः
तत्साम्यात् स्थाणुः । वृक्ष इव स्तब्धो दिवि
तिष्ठत्येकस्तेनेदं पूर्णं - पुरुषेण सर्वम् 

The ग in the name Ganga stands for Gayatri which represents the
eternal, supreme Brahman. In Gangashtakam, she is addressed as the
very embodiment of Brahman, पूर्णब्रह्मस्वरूपे . She is eternal
and formed by the fusion of the powers extracted from the three -
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. So Gayatri is worshipped in their forms
during the three times it is recited
(viz.) morning, noon and the evening. In view of this Shiva has placed
her on the head - in the chakra called Brahmarandram.
The scriptures define six chakras or seats of power in one's body.
The chakra on the head is above all these and is
the seat of Brahman. This is also the seat where one visualises one's
guru in the form of Brahman and meditates on him
because one's guru is not different from Brahman
गुरुस्साक्षात्परम्ब्रह्म . The fact that she is formed from the
powers of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is stated symbolically in the story
of Ganga.  
आदावादिपितामहस्य नियमव्यापारपात्रे जलं,
पश्चात् पत्रगशायिनो भगवतः पादोदकं पावनम् ।
भूयः शंभु जटा विभूषणमणिर्जह्नोर्महर्षेरियं,
कन्या कल्मषनाशिनी भगवती भागीरथी भूतले। 
This says that ``you Ganga started as water in the water pot of
Brahma, then came into contact with the foot of Vishnu and
again became the crown jewel on the locks of Shiva etc.''

Placed on the head of Shiva who is Himself the embodiment of knowledge
the stream of Ganga is symbolic of knowledge. So Shankaracharya refers
to it in his Kasi Panchakam as ज्ञानप्रवाहो विमलादि गङ्गा
The stream of right knowledge is the pure original Ganga. Again later
he says त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा(ie.) the
Ganga of knowledge is the mother of the three worlds.
This Ganga who is Gayatri and Brahman and is kept in the chakra in
the head by Shiva is same as Uma or Parvati  can be
deduced from the following references. These are taken from the well
known Lalitasahasranamam (LS).
1 - She is of the form of the three gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra.
सृष्टिकर्त्री ब्रह्मरूपा LS(265) गोप्त्री
गोविन्दरूपिणी LS(267) संहारिणी रुद्ररूपा LS(269)
2 - She is Gayatri गायत्री LS(420)
3 - She is Bhavani भवानी LS(112). Durga दुर्गा
LS(190). Parvati पार्वती LS(246). Uma उमा LS(633)
4 - She is seated on the head in the Brahmarandhram.
शिरस्थिता LS(591)

So Ganga is Brahman, is Gayatri and is Uma or Parvati. She
proclaims the Ardhanari (the inseparable combination of the
male and female principles) concept (अर्धनारी स्वरूपम् ) of
Shiva which is not explicitly seen in His representations (where Uma
is shown as a separate figure). Thus one who knows Ganga  knows Shiva
and vice versa.
Krishna says स्रोतसामस्मि जाह्नवी Of the rivers I am the
Ganges. So  it is not an ordinary river that the Lord had placed
on His head. No wonder, then, that the very utterance of the name
Ganga washes away one's sins even when one is miles
away from the river. This is said in this popular verse that is
normally recited before taking bath.
 गङ्गे गङ्गेति यो ब्रूयात् योजनानां शतैरपि। मुच्यते
सर्वपापेभ्यो विष्णुलोकं स गच्छति। 
The avadhuta saint Sadasiva Brahmam has composed a song in praise of
Ganga (jaya tungatarange gange जय तुङ्गतरङ्गे गङ्गे )
wherein he salutes Ganga as one who purifies the worlds and cuts
asunder the manifold bonds of mankind
(कमलभवाण्डकमण्डपवित्रे, बहुविधबन्धच्छेदलवित्रे।
लवित्रं = sickle; instrument for mowing).
Shri Gangashtakam says that if one dies on the banks of Ganga he goes
to higher lokas compared to which even the world of
Indra looks very inferior .
त्वदुत्सङ्गे गङ्गे पतति यदि कायस्तनुभृतां
तदा मातः शातक्रतव-पदल्लाभोऽप्यतिलघुः 

We can make one observation on the story of Bhagirata bringing
down Ganga. The Lord - being the father - always gives
much more than what one seeks from Him though this fact is not
appreciated. He is कामप्रदः । भक्तेभ्यः कामान् प्रकर्षेण
ददातीति कामप्रदः VS(298). He knows what the devotee asks and
why he asks for it. The Lord not only gives what is asked for but
goes further and fulfills his mission though unasked. In the case of
Bhagiratha, he could have asked Shiva
for salvation for himself and his forefathers and got it. Instead, he
just asked Him to bear the Ganga as she came down from
the heaven. But Lord Shiva helped the king  not only in bringing down
the river but also gave salvation to his forefathers then
and there itself. Please carefully look at what Shiva told the king
when He appeared before him. He said  ``I am pleased with
you. I will do what is dear to you.'' Ramayana (1.43.3 and 4)
    उमापतिः पशुपतिः राजानमिदमब्रवीत्। प्रीतस्तेऽहं
नरश्रेष्ठ करिष्यामि तव प्रियम्। 

We all know what was dear to the king and what was it that had been
haunting his mind for years and made him do severe
penance, once to Brahma (for thousand years eating once a month and
so on) and again to Lord Shiva. The king's idea was to
then lead the river to the place  where the ashes of his forefathers
were lying for ages and perform their final rites so that they
will attain release. But this was what he got as bonus. In addition
he got salvation for himself also though he did not ask for it.
Ganga represents Brahman and Shiva is DakShinamurthi - the giver of
knowledge about the Brahman. Thus the story of the
king getting the Ganga with Shiva's help implies he got the knowledge
of Brahman directly from the Lord which knowledge
results in salvation.

This was what happened in  the case of Arjuna also. He met Krisna at
Dwaraka and asked His help during the KurukShetra
war. Krishna agreed to help but He said He will not take up arms. But
even at the time when Arjuna made his request
Krishna knew what was the mission for which he was seeking His help.
And He fulfilled it then and there. Later on when
teaching Gita before the war had even started He told Arjuna:  
``These enemies of yours had been killed by me already. You
just be the instrument and enjoy all the glory.''
तस्मात्वमुत्तिष्ठ यशो लभस्व जित्वा शत्रून् भुङ्क्ष्व राज्यं समृद्धम् ।
ममैवैते निहिताः पूर्वमेव निमित्तमात्र्ं भव सव्यसाचिन्। BG(11.33)
At the time, Arjuna was unaware of the greatness of Krishna whom, as
he admits later on, he considered as his friend only.  He laboured
hard and ``fought the war'' but it was over even before it
started. He ``won'' it and got all the glory.
In the same way King Bhagirata took the trouble to drive ahead of
Ganga all the way to the seas and then to the nether world
where he saw the ashes of his forefathers, performed the last rites
with the holy waters from Ganga and ``got them salvation.''
which was already an accomplished fact.
The Ganga was named after him as Bhagirathi. This
was the case with Dhruva, who wanted to be a king but he got that and
also a permanent place in the heavens.

ओंकारवाटीकुरङ्गं - 
ओंकार = the holy syllable OM; वाटी = garden, park; 
कुरंगः = deer; Shiva is likened to a deer in the garden of the
holy syllable - meaning He is represented by OM also known as pranava.
ओंकाररूपः - ओंकारः रूपं स्वरूपं यस्य सः
तथा(SS138)  Shri Krishna says in His Gita (10-25) ``I am OM
among the words.'' गिरामस्म्येकमक्षरम् Manu, the famous
law giver, says that the letter OM by itself represents the ultimate
reality - the Brahman एकाक्षरं परं ब्रह्म He adds that
the creator Brahma extracted the three letters from the three vedas
and so the syllable Om is the essence of the vedas
अकारं चाप्युकारं च मकारं च प्रजापतिः ।
वेदत्रयान्निरदुहद् भूर्भुवः स्वरितीति च 
A similar reference is seen in Chandogyopanishad (2.23.3) 
तान्यभ्यतपत्तेभ्योऽभितप्तेभ्य ॐकारः संप्रास्रवत्त्द्यथा
Shri Bhagavatam says that sound OM was acquired spontaneously by
Brahma - the first born when he was in deep meditation. BH(12.6.44 and 39) . It says that the origin of the sound
consisting of three parts is unmanifest. It flashes by itself and it
reveals the nature of the  almighty and supreme spirit. 
समाहितात्मनो ब्रह्मन् ब्रह्मणः परमेष्ठिनः  ।
हृद्याकाशादभून्नादो वृत्तिरोधाद् विभाव्यते। ।
ततोऽभूत् त्रिवृदोंकारो योऽव्यक्तप्रभवः स्वराट्  ।
यत् तल्लिङ्गं भगवतो ब्रह्मणः परमात्मनः । 

Manu says further that a student (during his gurukula days when he
learns the vedas) should utter OM both when beginning
and ending his studies. The reason, he says, is that without uttering
OM in the beginning the learning perishes and if OM is not
said in the end what is learnt will not be retained 
ब्राह्मणः प्रणवं कुर्यादादावन्ते च सर्वदा।
स्रवत्यनोङ्कृतं पूर्वं पुरस्ताच्च विशीर्यति। 
In view of this Kalidasa compares Manu -the first of kings in the
solar dynasty to OM in a grand simile आसीन्महीक्षितामाद्यः
प्रणवश्चन्दसामिव 

Pranava :-
We can see discussions about pranava in Mandukya, Shiva Atharvasikha,
Prasna and Nrisimha Uttaratapini upanishads. This is
also mentioned in Vicharasagaram. Here we will see it in brief.
प्रणवः - प्रणवो नाम परमात्मनो वाचक ओङ्कारः ,
तदभेदोपचारेणायं प्रणवः (VS-957).
He is in the form of pranava represented by OM. He is not different
from the creation. So pranava represents both brahman
and the universe. Sage Patanjali also has said this in his Yoga Sutra
(1.26)तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः । प्रकर्षेण नूयते अनेनेति
प्रणवः God is greatly praised by this. Earlier we saw that a
stotram mentions the attributes or the qualities of the subject of
the stotram. Thus pranavam indicates the auspicious qualities of the
Lord and obtains His blessings to one who
chants it.  Patanjali adds (1.27): तज्जपस्तदर्थभावनम्॥

The chanting of pranava with understanding and faith is meditation
on the Iswara.
Pranava is made of the three letters A,U and M. These three letters
represent the consciousness presiding over the three states -
waking, dream and deep sleep states which one passes through every
day. The consciousnes is same but it functions diff erently in these states. The Mandukya upanishad views pranava as
being composed of two parts: one having sound and the
other without sound. The OM as specified above made up of the three
letters is pronounced and constitutes the ``sound'' part.
The upanishad says that the brief interlude that preceeds and
succeeds this ``sound'' part forms the ``silent'' component - the fourth letter
अमात्रश्चतुर्थो ऽव्यवहार्यः प्रपञ्चोपशमः शिवो ऽद्वैत
एवमोंकार आत्मैव संविशत्यात्मानं, य एवं वेद, य
एवं वेद(Mandukya 12)
They represent the two aspects of God (viz.) with form and without
form respectively. The ``sound'' part signifies the saguna
Iswara and the ``silent'' part the nirguna Iswara. Thus one
can worship  OM as God with form. This is like invoking our favou rite deity in an idol or saligrama stone. Here we invoke the God
about whom we do not have firsthand knowledge but learnt
from scriptures or  from some other source in the idol or some other
form of representation and worship. The representa tion is known as pratikam प्रतीकम्. Meditating on the fourth or
the silent part as ``I the Self'' is known as
Ahamgrahadhyanam अहंग्रहध्यानम् One who meditates like
this is called a muni मननात् मुनिरुच्यते In this type of
meditation there is no difference between the meditator and Iswara or
the object of meditation. As a result of this meditation the muni is
blessed with the knowledge of the Self and crosses over the samsara.
Thus is explained Shiva's name ओङ्काररूपः । ओङ्कारं रूपं
स्वरूपं यस्य सः तथा। ओङ्काररूपत्वं च
तदभिधानत्वाद्वा, तत्प्रतीकत्वाद्वा। तदभिधानत्वं
ओमित्यक्षरमित्यादिना प्रसिद्धम्। ओङ्कार प्रतीकत्वं तु यः
पुनरेतं त्रिमात्रेणेत्यादिना प्रश्नोपनिषदादौ प्रसिद्धम्।
परं चापरं च ब्रह्म यदोङ्कार इति श्रुतिः VS(138).  

The question, now is, if He is Himself omkara or the pranava, why
then say He is the deer in the park called OM? The answer
is that He is OM the park as Paramatma as well as the deer the
individual JIvatma. They are one and the same but look diff erent to the uninitiated. The deer, unaware of its status, roams
around in the park feeding  and enjoying itself. This is an echo
of the famous Mundakopanishad mantra
द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षं
परिषस्वजाते। तयोरन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्यनश्ननन्यो
अभिचाकशीति। MU (3.1.1)
This mantra talks of two friendly birds sitting side by side on a
tree. One is eating and relishing the fruits and the other one is
quietly watching it. Here one of the birds represents the Jivatma.
Eating the fruits is enjoying the results of the past karma and
the other bird which looks on is the Paramatma as He is not attached
to the fruits of action. Similarly Devi is described as
ओंकारपञ्जरशुकी a female parrot in the cage called OM in
the Devi Navaratnamala. The saint composer Thiagaraja of Tiruvaiyaru
addresses Rama as ओंकारपञ्जरकीर a parrot in the cage
called OM in his famous song beginning Jagadanandakaraka. Similarly
the saint composer SadasivaBrahmam talks of Krishna as
प्रणवपयोरुहगर्भकपाली one who is hidden inside the lotus of pranava (in his song kridathi
vanamali क्रीडति वनमाली ) 

सिद्धसंसेविताङ्घ्रिं   - 
सिद्धः = a superhuman being of great purity and holiness
possessing eight supernatural powers called siddhis. Can also be
taken to mean a great sage संसेवित = worshipped; अंघ्रि = foot
He is worshipped by great sages and other semidivine beings
endowed with supernatural powers महर्षिवन्दितः - महर्षिभिः
वामदेवादिभिः हरभक्तादिभिश्च ज्ञानार्तं वन्दितः ।
उपलक्षणमेतत् स्तोत्र-जप-पूजा-तप आदीनाम्(SS536) सद्भिः
सम्पूजितः । सद्भिः सात्विकैर्देवर्ष्यादिभिः सम्पूजितः ।
भक्तिश्रद्धादिना गन्धपुष्पादिभिः
प्रदक्षिणनमस्कारादिभिश्च पूजितः सम्पूजितः SS(777)
The word siddha सिद्ध means accomplished or perfected. Linking
with the earlier word, the muni meditates on the pranava.
ॐकारं बिन्दुसंयुक्तं नित्यं ध्यायन्ति योगिनः Once he
understands that he, the meditator, and the Iswara the
object of meditation represented by pranava are not different , then
he achieves his goal and becomes a siddha purusha.  The Mandukya
Upanishad sentence quoted earlier says this only (viz.) that one who
realises the true meaning of  the Omkara - that
it stands for the non-dual, indescribable Shiva obtains his goal which
is his own Self. Shri Shuka mentions this in his prayer before
he begins to narrate Bhagavatam to King ParikShit.
यदङ्घ्र्यभिध्यानसमाधिधौतया धियानुपश्यन्ति हि
तत्त्वमात्मनः BH(2.4.21) 

Such a realised sage  abides in his Self.  So it is said 
तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः Hanuman is
such a siddha who has immersed himself in the sacred Ganga and drank
deep its water of knowledge. So he is known as बुद्धिमतां
वरिष्ठः = best among the knowledgeable people. He sees his Lord
Rama within himself all the time. Whenever His name is mentioned the
Ganga within him wells up and flows out as tears of joy and his hands
go up over his
head in salute यत्र यत्र रघुनात कीर्तनं तत्र तत्र
कृतमस्तकाञ्जलिं बाष्पवारिपरिपूरितेक्षणं मारुतिं नमत
राक्षसान्तकम् says a popular verse about Hanuman. So his being
shown as seated at the feet of Rama brings
out the idea that siddhas worship the feet of the Lord.
Truly speaking a siddha has nothing to worship as he has no second to
him. Whatever he does becomes an act of worship.
Sankaracharya says this in his Shiva mAnasa puja 
आत्मा त्वं गिरिजा मतिः सहचराः प्राणाः शरीरं गृहं
पूजा ते विषयोपभोगरचना निद्रा समाधिस्थ्तितिः  ।
सञ्चारः पदयोः प्रदक्षिणविधिः स्तोत्राणि सर्वा गिरः
यद्यत्कर्म करोमि तत्तदकिलं शंभो तवाराधनम्। 

Since the siddha has identified with Ishwara he is detached from his
body. He knows that he got his body because of prarabdham and it will continue to hang on as appendage as long as the the
vestige of prarabdham remains. He is aware that prarab dam will take care of it. So he is not concerned about it just as
drunkard does not  overly bother about his dress. Krishna says
this to Uddhava: 
देहं च नश्वरमवस्थितमुत्थितं वा सिद्धो न पश्यति
यतोऽध्यगमत्स्वरूपम् ।
दैवादपेतमुत दैववशादुपेतं वासो यथा परिकृतं
मदिरामदान्धः । BH(11.13.36) 

Once his prarabdham is exhausted the body drops off. There is not
death in the usual sense. His soul does not go anywhere as
in the case of death of ordinary people but just merges in the all
pervading brahman. This is like a pot getting broken. The
space within the pot is not disturbed but just becomes one with
surrounding space. This is said clearly in Brihadaranyakopanishad (4.4.3) 
योऽकामो निष्काम आप्तकाम आत्मकामो न तस्य
प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति ब्रहैव सन् ब्रह्माप्येति
This was what is said to have happened in Bhishma's case .
आत्मन्यात्मानमावेस्य सोऽन्तश्वास उपारमत् BH(1.9.43) 

भजे = I worship मार्गबन्धुम् the Lord Margabandhu.  

I worship Lord Margabandhuon whose limbs snakes appear prominently,
whose head looks charming with the waves of the
celestial river Ganga, who is like a deer in the garden of Omkara and
whose feet are served by siddhas (great seers).

      ३. नित्यम् चिदानन्दरूपं 
      निह्नुताशेषलोकेशवैरिप्रतापं 
      कार्तस्वरागेन्द्रचापं कृत्तिवासं 
      भजे दिव्यसन्मार्गबन्धुम्। शंभो 
This verse is the third among the five verses that make up the
stotram. Thus it forms the centre-piece and is loaded with precious
vedantic truths. It was said earlier that a stotram  will describe the
Lord with form and will also refer to His formless aspect. We see the
formless aspect of the Shiva being emphasised here
नित्यं चिदानन्दरूपं  - नित्यं = eternal, ever lasting,
imperishable चित् = pure intelligence आनन्द =supreme
bliss रूपं = form.

These words are the repetition of the famous
upanishadic mantra सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म 
TU(2.1.2) that says
Brahman is satyam, jnanam and anantam.   This is one of Shiva's
names सच्चिदानन्दरूपः । सत्पदेन कालत्रयाबाध्यं
स्वरूपमुच्यते। चित्पदेन 
प्रकाशान्तरनिरपेक्षतया प्रकाशमानम्। आनन्दपदेन 
निरतिशयप्रेमास्पदतया सुखरूपं एतत्त्रितियात्मकरूपं यस्य सः
सच्चिदानन्दरूपः । SS(653). Rama's form is existence,
knowledge and bliss सत्यज्ञानानन्दशरीरी says the saint
Sadasiva Brahmendra  in the song खेलति मम हृदये (kelati mama
hrudaye). So is Shri Lalita's form:  सच्चिदानन्दरूपिणी। सत्वं
चित्वमानन्दश्च  स्वरूपमत एव 
विद्यान्तरेषूपसंहार्यमस्या इति सच्चिदानन्दरूपिणी। LS(699)

नित्यं  - Nityam implies eternal existence - that is - it never ceases
to be. It is not limited by time. Terms like the past, present and future
are not applicable with reference to it. Lalita is known as Nitya
नित्या कालत्रयेऽप्यबाध्या। अविनाशी वा  अरेऽयमात्मे ति
श्रुतेः । LS(136).

शाश्वतः and सत्यम् are two other names that have the same
meaning as Nityam
शाश्वतः । सर्वेषु कालेषु एकरूपतया भवतीति
शाश्वतः । ᳚शाश्वतोयं 
पुराणः᳚ इति श्रुतिः । SS(398).(ie.) He exists in all times in the same form or
without any change शश्वत् सर्वेषु कालेषु भवतीति शाश्वतः,
᳚शाश्वतं शिवमच्युतम्᳚ इति 
श्रुतेः । VS(56).

satyam सत्यम्।  कालत्रयाबाद्यं
सत्यम् SS(432)अवितथरूपत्वात् परमात्मा सत्यः ᳚सत्यं 
ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म᳚ इति 
श्रुतेः । VS(106) In the invocatory
verse to Shri Bhagavatam Shri Vyasa salutes the Lord saying सत्यं परं
धीमहि(ie.) we meditate on the supreme Reality that is not affected
by the three time periods - the past, present and the future. BH(1.1.1)
. He also winds up with the same words सत्यं परं धीमहि
BH(12.13.19) implying what is discussed in between the beginning and
the end or the subject matter of the purana is none other than Brahman
which is Satyam.

Shri Lalita is known as सत्यज्ञानानन्दरूपा॥ सत्यं ज्ञानं
आनन्दश्च रूपं यस्याः ।  ᳚सत्यं   ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म᳚
᳚विज्ञानमानन्दं ब्रह्मेति᳚ श्रुतेः । LS(790).

Bhartrihari, in the invocatory verse to his Satakatrayam  salutes the
Lord saying दिक्कालाद्यनवच्छिन्ना 
अनन्तचिन्मात्रमूर्तये
He says that God is of the form of eternal consciousness unlimited by
spatial direction, time etc दिशः 
प्राच्यादिदिक्प्रदेशाः,
काला  भूतभविष्यद्वर्तमानरूपा, 
आदिशब्दसंगृहीतानि
वस्तूनि तथा च दिक्काला आदयो येषां तानि दिक्कालानि। 
तैरनवच्छिन्नापरिकॣप्ता। विभुत्वान्नित्यत्वादेकत्वाच्च
देशतः कालतो
वस्तुतश्चापरिच्छिन्नेत्यर्थः । अत
एव अनन्तापरिमिता। ट्रिविधपरिच्छेदशून्यत्वा
दखण्डदण्डायमाने-  त्यर्थः ।
चित्  - chit means pure intelligence and indicates brahman. So
the Lord gets the following names चिदात्मा। चित् -
चैतन्यं आत्मस्वरूपं यस्य सः चिदात्मा SS(456). Also
चिन्मयः । चिन्मयश्चिद्रूपः ।
SS(829). Devi is described as
चिन्मयी ।
चिदभेदाच्चिन्मयी LS(251).
Now let us go back to the reference from Bartruhari:  
(ie.) अनन्तचिन्मात्रमूर्तये ।
चिन्मात्रा  ज्ञानघना
च ।
चिदेकरसेति यावत्। तादृशी मूर्तिर्यस्य तस्मै ।
एतद्रूपायेत्यर्थः । No doubt brahman is without any limitations
mentioned above. But it is not void or empty like space which also seems
unlimited. It is not inert but shines in the form of consciousness. This
is clarified here.

From where did He get His wisdom? In reply the invocatory verse in
Shri Bhagavatam referred to earlier says: अभिज्ञः स्वराट्। स्वेनैव
राजते यस्तम्। स्वतः सिद्धज्ञानमित्यर्थः । He is omniscient. His
knowledge is inherent and not obtained from anyone else or any other
source. It is knowledge itself without a trace of ignorance.

आनन्द   Ananda : Brahamn is of the form of pure bliss आनन्दो
ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात् TU(3.6.1). The Taittiriyopanishad has a chapter
exclusively devoted to the ananda aspect of brahman. This chapter is hence
known as Brahmanandavalli or Anandavalli. This chapter is unique in that
it talks of several grades of ananda experienced by different beings. It
starts with the maximum happiness that is possible to be experienced by
a human being as the unit of measure. The next higher grade of ananda
is hundred times this unit. Thus several grades are mentioned (including
that of Indra and Brihaspathi) and the top most one mentioned is that of
Brahma the creator. But a wise person who has studied the shastras and
got discrimination knows that even Brahma's happiness is fragile and
limited. The Brihadaranyopanishad says that any ananda experienced by
any being is just a droplet derived from the bliss that is Brahman
एतस्यैवानन्दस्य अन्यानि भूतानि मात्रामुपजीवन्ति(4.3.32)
Incidentally this is one of the names of Shri Lalita. (LS365)
स्वात्मानन्दलवीभूत ब्रह्माद्यानन्दसंततिः । The commentator
Bhaskararaya explains this name referring to these quotations
only. He says स्वस्या आत्मरूपो य 
आनन्दस्य लवीभूता इन्द्राद्यानन्दबिन्दुपर्यालोचनया सागरायमाणत्वेनालवा
अपि  देव्यानन्दसागरस्य लवाः संपद्यमानाः ब्रह्मादीनां

One may wonder why should the upanishad take the trouble
to describe the
many grades of ananda starting from the bliss that can be enjoyed by a
human being. The answer is that the detailed description is a carrot the
upanishad is dangling before us. It wants to reveal the fact that even
the highest degree of happiness that one could enjoy is just a particle
of that limitless ocean of bliss. It wants us to get excited at this
revelation. It wants to prod us to strive hard and reach the pinnacle
of bliss that is brahmananda and not be content with merely scratching
its surface.  The following are the Lord's names in this context 

नन्दी। परमानन्दविग्रहो नन्दी। ᳚विज्ञानमानन्दं ब्रह्मे᳚ति
श्रुतिः । SS(189) and VS(618)आनन्दी। सुखस्वरूपत्वात्

SS(673)

निह्नुताशेषलोकेशवैरिप्रतापम्  - निह्नुत = eliminated
अशेष = without remainder लोकेशः = lord of the universe -
here it refers to Indra वैरिन् = enemy प्रतापः =dignity,
glory, valour.

Shiva is the destroyer of the valour and pride of Ravana who was the enemy
of Indra. Once Ravana tried to lift Kailasa as he felt he was strong
enough to carry even the abode of  the Lord. He was inebriated with power
because he could conquer even Indra and other gods. He forgot that all
his might and glory were only due to the blessings of the Lord. He even
said that Shiva has not known that a danger has come to Him! This incident
is mentioned in Ramayana (Uttara Kanda - canto 16).  विज्ञातव्यं न
जानीते भयस्थानमुपस्थितम्(Uttara kanda - 16-24). Shiva wanted
to teach him a lesson and curb his pride. So He playfully pressed His
toe. The pressure applied by Him crushed Ravana under the mountain.
ततो राम महादेवो देवानां प्रवरो हरः ।
पादाङ्गुष्ठेन
तं शैलं  पीडयामास लीलया। ।
पीडितास्तु ततस्तस्य
शैलस्तम्भोपमा भुजाः । (UK. 16-27,28).
Ravana struggled hard but was not able to extricate himself
from the tight spot. Finally he prayed to the Lord and got
himself released. So Shiva gets the name अङ्गुष्ठशिरसा 
लङ्कानाथदर्पहरः । अङ्गुष्ठशिरसा पादाङ्गुष्ठाग्रेण
लङ्कानाथस्य रावणस्य दर्पं गर्वं हरतीति हरः । इदं

᳚नमः सहमानाय निव्याधिन᳚ इति श्रुतिः । SS(623).

Ravana was the grandson of the great sage Pulastya and the son
of an equally great sage Vivasva. He was born as an asura due to a
curse. Krishna gives a description of asuric nature in the 16th chapter
of Gita entitled दैवासुर सम्पद्विभागयोगः and also in the 18th
chapter. He says that people with asuric nature are given to ostentation,
arrogance, lust, anger and insolence. They will nurture innumerable
hopes. These tendencies will pave the way for their downfall.  We see that
Ravana's character fits this description exatly. These qualities lead
to his ruin. Ravana was vastly learned (as is indicated by ten heads):  
but was foolish enough to think he could shake the Lord who is नित्यः 
all pervading, firm and unshakeable सर्वगतः स्थाणुः अचलः । 
BG(2-24).  In fact if He shakes the universe will shake and without
His will one can not move even a blade of grass. This is graphically
described in a story in Kenopanishad.  Thus Ravana committed a great
mistake but Shiva curbed his pride and let him off
कार्तस्वरागेन्द्रचापम्  - कार्तस्वरम् = gold: अगः = mountain:  
इन्द्रः = lord and in this context means best: चापः = bow:  
This refers to Shiva using Meru - the famed mountain of gold -
as a bow in His fight against the three asuras. The three demons named
KamalakShan, DarukakShan and Vidyunmali were very powerful because of
the boons they obtained. They lived in three cities built by Maya the
divine architect. They troubled the devas to no end. The devas entreated
Shiva to save them from these asuras. When Shiva started to fight them the
devas wanted to take part in the fight. The earth became the chariot,
the sun and the moon became the wheels, Meru the bow, the snake Seshan
the bow string, Vishnu the quiver and so on. But Shiva felt that all these
elaborate paraphernalia was superfluous for the task. So He discarded
them and destroyed the three cities just with a smile. When the asuras
repented Shiva forgave them and took them into His service. This deed of
Shiva is often referred to in hymns क्षोणी यस्य रथो रथाङ्गयुगळं
चन्द्रार्क-बिम्बद्वयं
कोदंडः कनकाचलो हरिरभूत् बाणो

SS(104). and 
पुरञ्जयः - पुरं त्रिपुरं जयतीति
पुरञ्जयः । ᳚तेषामसुराणामि᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(939). One who
conquered the three cities and

गिरिधन्वा। इदं च

is mount Meru. SA(65).  Incidentally, this episode shows that the Lord
is capable of using anything as a weapon. As Rama He used just a piece
of straw to chase Kakasura who misbehaved with Sita. In the case of
Tipura He chose to use a mountain as His bow. He can do without any
weapon also. He discarded the bow and burnt down the three cities with a
smile. He subdued Ravana with a little pressure from His toe.He destroyed
Manmatha with a mere look.

The Tripura episode conceals the essence of vedanta as do the stories
in our puranas. Krishna mentions this fact to Uddhava in His final
advice परोक्षवादा ऋषयः '' The words of the sages are indirect
in their import.'' BH(11-21-35).  The reason is that these great truths
are meant only for those who have faith in the words of the shastras
and the teachers who expound them, are sincere and are ready to put in
the needed effort to learn them. They cannot be laid bare to those who
are not qualified to receive them. In fact such people run the risk
of misunderstanding the teachings and being mislead by them . That
is why Krishna, after concluding the teaching of Gita, warns Arjuna
that the valuable lessons taught to him should not be imparted to
one who is not devoted etc., as said above इदं ते नातपस्काय
नाभक्ताय कदाचन। न चाशुष्रूषवे वाच्यं न च
मां
योऽभ्यसूयति। BG(18-67).  Great truths, like precious diamonds are
not meant to be hawked in the streets like cheap vegetables.  A diamond
merchant keeps the diamonds carefully locked in an iron safe in his
shop. Only a handful of people out of several millIons in the city
will be fit to enter the shop and enquire about them. The merchant,
will welcome the customer, engage him in small talk  and enquire about
his requirements. By then he would have assessed the customer's worth
and seriousness to do business. Then only will he unlock the safe,
bring out his wares and show them to the customer. Similarly vedantic
truths are invaluable and are to be guarded carefully and given only to
the deserving.  Brief explanation of the Tripura episode follows.

It was said that our body is viewed as being made of three layers -
the gross body, the subtle body and the causal body. These three
bodies are the three puras or  cities. The  paramatma who is of the
form of chaitanyam or consciousness is omnipresent and is present in
the body also, and enlivens it. The body itself, being mere bundle of
matter, is inert. Krishna says this इदं
शरीरं कौन्तेय
क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते and in the next verse क्षेत्रज्ञं च मां
विद्धि सर्व क्षेत्रेषु भारत। BG(13- 1 and 2). The consciousness
present in the body is known as atma or jiva or jivatma. But it is not a
part or product of the body that is liable to decay and destruction. Such
modifications of the body do not affect the jivatma. Even on death
it is the subtle body which travels to take another body (as stated
earlier). The atma being all pervading does not travel anywhere. It
is like a pot being made. We may call the space confined in the pot as
pot-space (to distinguish it from the total space though really there is
no such division) but it was not created when the pot was made. When the
pot is broken, it is pot that is destroyed and not the ``pot space.'' It
has nowhere to go. The confines of the pot having gone it just merges
with the total space that is out side the pot also. Thus the atma has
nothing to do with the body. This is said in Tattvabodha clearly as
आत्मा कः?What is the Self?
स्थूल-सूक्ष्म-कारण-
शरीराद् व्यतिरिक्तः पञ्चकोशातीतः सन् अवस्थात्रयसाक्षी
सच्चिदानन्दस्वरूपः सन्
यस्तिष्ठति स आत्मा। Self is other
than the gross, subtle and causal bodies. It is beyond the five sheaths
and the witness to the three states of consciousness. It is of the nature
of existence, consciousness and bliss.

Thus there is no birth or modifications or death for the jivatma as
is the case with the body. Krishna says this: न जायते म्रियते
वा कदाचि-न्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः ।
अजो नित्यः
शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे। BG(2-20).

The pot because of which the infinite space (that has nothing to do with
the pot) gets the apparent limitation as ``pot space'' is called upadhi. In
the same way the body mind complex is upadhi for the paramatma and it gets
the name jivatma (though both are one and the same). Its glorious state
gets covered by the veiling power of maya (called avidya or ignorance)
and it gets bound. This leads the jiva to identify itself with the
limitations of the three bodies. It imagines it is a finite creature,
helpless and subject to sorrows like sickness, old age, death etc. This
is known as samsara. Truly speaking the jivatma being none other than
the paramatma and of the form of pure wisdom does not act or undergo
any change. Since it does not act it does not also reap the fruits of
action called कर्मफलम् (ie.) joy or sorrow. That is, it is not
a  कर्ता or भोक्ता (i.e.) doer or enjoyer or in other words
atma is said to be akarta and abhokta (अकर्ता and अभोक्ता ).
One who has shed his identity with the body and clearly established
his oneness with the Self  is, therefore, not bound by the results of
actions . The mistaken identification with the body and imgining he or
she is an individual who has to act etc., is called ego or ahamkara and
is the cause of all the problems.        प्रकृतेः कृयमाणानि
गुणैः कर्माणि सर्वशः ।
अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताहमिति मन्यते। BG(3-27).
An example will illustrate this peculiar situation. A person goes to
sleep in his cosy house after a sumptuous meal. After some time he
enters the dream world. In his dream he travels to  a distant land and
is stranded. He has lost his belongings and is famished. But he has no
money to buy anything. The person is not used to  such a privation and
so is feeling miserable.  This goes on for some (dream) days.Ultimately
the intensity of the suffering becomes too much to bear and he wakes up
with a start . To his utter delight he realises all that had happened was
only a dream and he has not left his comfortable bed. He feels sheepish
to think of the suffering he had gone through.

In the case narrated above all the suffering and misery was unreal. But
it appeared real because the person identified himself with the dream
body that was not his. The dream body was merely a projection of his
mind and so had no substance. When the dreamer woke up he gave up the
identification and was free from sorrow. In the same way vedanta says
that the individual's bondage and ensuing samsara are imaginary and due
to wrong identification with the body-mind complex. This mistake is the
result of ajnanam or ignorance. It will go when the individual sheds
his ignorance and realises that he is not the body-mind complex but
the atma whose nature is नित्यं चिदानन्दरूपम् as said in the
first line of this verse. Krishna says this to his friend Uddhava: 
देहस्थोऽपि न देहस्थो विद्वान्स्वप्नाद्यथोत्थितः ।
अदेहस्थोऽपि
देहस्थः कुमतिः  स्वप्नदृग्यथा। BH(11-11-8).  A wise man, though
he appears to be in the body, has no identification with the body like
the one who had woken up from a dream. But a man without discrimination
is like one having a dream. He has chosen to (dis-identify with his true
body and) identify with his (dream) body (and suffers the consequences).
The dream body is only thought in the mind but the thought is so powerful
that it makes him identify himself with the dream body, undergo the
vicarious suffering and forget his real body that is ensconced in the bed.

Thus there has to be a second waking up, as it were, from our so-called
waking stage to the real awakened stage with the advent of knowledge or
jnanam. Till then one is in the clutches of agnanam or ignorance which
forces us into karma or action that  brings in the fruits of action
which in turn results in rebirth etc.. The grace of the Lord confers this
wisdom and takes one beyond the three bodies that envelop the jiva. This
is said in the DakShinamurthy Stotram as 
यः साक्षात्-कुरुते प्रबोधसमये स्वात्मान-मेवाद्वयं
तस्मै श्रीगुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये
When the dreamer wakes up from the nightmare the dreamer merges with the
waker (if we may so call the one who has woken up) and not ``become'' the
waker. He alone remains. He does not see the waker but claims himself
to be the waker. This claiming is साक्षात् कुरुते So also in the
case of self-knowledge one does not experience or ``become'' the atma;
but स्वात्मानं
अद्वयमेव साक्षात्कुरुते owns up his true
nature as atma.

Shiva's names relating to Tripura are त्रिपुरान्तकः । त्रीणि पुराणि

SA(68). Krishna tells Uddhava that He is Himself Shiva who destroyed
the three cities त्रिपुरघ्नो धनुष्मताम् BH(11-11-20).
Meru mountain. The Meru mountain is mentioned in our puranas,
Mahabharata and Ramayana etc. It is said to be rich in gold and
other precious jewels and is said to be in the center of the
earth. The Himalayas are in the southern part of the Jambudwipa
in whose center is the Meru. The Bharathavarsha (India) is in the
south of the Himalayas. One of the mountains surrounding the Meru
is the Mandhara which was used by the gods to churn the ocean of
milk. Shri Suka mentions this when he gives a description of the
creation एषं मध्ये इलावृत्ं 
नामाभ्यन्तरवर्षं
यस्य नाभ्यामवस्थितः सर्वतः सौवर्णः कुलगिरिराजो 
मेरुर्द्वीपायामसमुन्नाहः कर्णिकाभूतः कुवलयकमलस्य
मूर्धनि 
द्वात्रिंशत्सहस्रयोजनविततो मूले षोडश्सहस्रं
तावतान्तर्भूम्यां 
प्रविष्टः । BH(5-16-6). The abodes of the
gods like Brahma are situated on the peaks of the mountain. Lalita
is said to reside on one of the peaks of Meru and so gets the name 
सुमेरुश‍ृङ्गमध्यस्था। सुमेरोर्हेमद्रेर्मध्यश‍ृङ्गे तिष्ठतीति
तत्स्था ।
शोभने मेरुमध्यश‍ृङ्गे इति वा LS(55).  The sun
and the moon are said to go round the mountain. Our poets mention this
fact often. Kalidasa refers to the sun going round Meru in his Raghuvamsa
(7-24). He says that Aja and Indumati going round the sacred fire during
their wedding was like the day and the night revolving round Meru
प्रदक्षिणप्रक्रमणात्कृशानोरुदर्चिषस्तन्मिथुनं चकासे ।
मेरोरुपान्तेष्विव वर्तमानं अन्योन्यसंसक्तमहस्त्रियामम्। 
Krishna says that He is Meru among the mountains मेरुः
शिखरिणामहं BG (10-23) and 
धिष्ण्यानामस्म्यहं मेरुः । BH(11-11-21). All these show that meru
is considered a very holy mountain 

कृत्तिवासं- कृत्तिः = bark of a tree , skin, hide 
वासः = dress. Shiva is reputed to be dressed in the bark of
trees and skins of tiger and elephant. Once some rishis of Daruka
forest performed a sacrifice. It seems they were very  proud of
their spiritual accomplishments. Shiva wanted to test their mind-set
and teach them a lesson. So He passed by in the form of a shabbily
dressed mendicant. The sages were furious to see the mendicant. From
the sacrificial fire they created a ferocious elephant and a tiger
and set them to attack the mendicant. But Shiva killed the animals,
and wrapped Himself in their skins. The sages were humbled. They
realised their mistake and surrendered to Shiva. So He gets
the following names.  व्याघ्रचर्माम्बरः । व्याघ्रचर्म

दुर्वासः । दुर्निरीक्षं वासो गजसिंहव्याघ्रचर्मादिरूपं यस्य
सः तथा। SS(566).  Kalidasa wonders at Shiva, dressing Himself
in the bark and skins of animals though He is the supreme lord, and
profusely showers blessings on His devotees एकैश्वर्ये स्थितेऽपि
प्रणतबहुफले यः स्वयं कृत्तिवासाः । Malavikagnimitra (1.1).

These incidents show that the Lord is capable of vanquishing his enemies
with ease. They are meant to warn one like Ravana who takes Him lightly
that they will have to face dire consequences. But His nature is to
subdue pride wherever it shows up - be it in an asura like Ravana or god
like Manmatha or even great rishis who should have known better. This
is because pride is an obstacle to the spiritual progress. Once they
realise their mistake and give up their pride Shiva blesses them.

Now a few words about Shiva wearing the bark or skins of animals: First
this kind of dress, His matted locks etc., proclaim that Shiva is beyond
all varnas or grades of society - like brahmin, kShatriya etc., - and
ashramas or stages of life - like student, householder etc.. In other
words He is an अतिवर्णाश्रमी Such a one is not bound by any rules
or regulations applicable to any varna or ashrama. He only gave out the
scriptures to enable us to become mature spiritually  and realise Him.So
He is known as bhandhu or well wisher बन्धुः । बन्धुकृत्यं
हिताहितोपदेसं श्रुतिस्मृतिलक्षणं कृतवानिति॥ ᳚स नो
बन्धुर्जनिते᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(581). So these very same rules cannot
bind Him.  The description of Shri Suka in Shri Bhagavatam matches the above
description of a paramahamsa. It says तत्राभवद् भगवान् व्यासपुत्रो
यदृच्छया गामटमानोऽनपेक्षः ।
अलक्ष्यलिङ्गो निजलाभतुष्टः
वृतश्चबालैरवधूतवेषः । BH(1-19-25).

Secondly, the bark of the tree and the skins that Shiva wears represent the
cessation of birth. Birth and rebirth have been discussed earlier. We saw
earlier while discussing the implications of Tripura that one's mistaken
identity with the body is the cause of all problems starting with karma
resulting in fruits of karma and then birth(s) to ``enjoy'' the results
of karma.   The dawn of wisdom will dispel the ignorance about the
reality and reveal one's true status. This will end the cycle of birth
and death. Lord's grace can give us the wisdom. So Shiva is called Hara
हरः ।
स्व विषय ज्ञानेनाविद्यादेर्हरणाद्धरः । SS(392).
The late Paramacharya of Kanchipuram had explained the incident of
Shiva burning the three cities with a smile thus. ``The All-pervasive,
All-knowing Supreme alone can liberate us from the cycle of birth and
death by vouchsafing us the jnana to throw off the fetters of this
restricting human body and to find bliss supreme in the merger of the
jivatma with the paramatma. Shri Parameswara destroyed Tripura by the
smile that appeared on His face on a contemplation of the humour of the
situation. In relation to ourselves, the Tripura is the physical body in
the three states of sthoola, sookShma and karana. The consciousness of
these three states of our body can be overcome only when we realise the
supreme bliss that radiates from Iswara.'' (Acharya's Call-Part1- P251).

The body is the result of prarabdam and another one is just waiting
around the corner when this drops. So one should not get attached to
it but be ready to leave it without regret when the prescribed hour
comes. Instead, one should  use one's lifetime to gain discrimination
and not chase the shadows. The avadhuta sage tells this to king Yadu
लब्ध्वा सुदुर्लभमिदं बहुसंभ्वान्ते मानुष्यमर्थदमनित्यमपीह
धीरः ।
तूर्णं यतेत न पतेदनुमृत्यु यावन्निःश्रेयसाय
विषयः खलु सर्वतः स्यात्। BH(11-9-290).  The human body is
invaluable as it is got after innumerable births. No doubt it is frail
and impermanent. But it is with this human body alone one can work to
attain the life's goal. Plants and animals come lower in the rung of
evolution. They face many limitations. So our shastras say that if one
fails to properly use the rare human birth but lives to eat and leads a
hedonistic life-style without a thought about the hereafter he is most
unwise and incurs incalculable loss. In fact they say that such a one
is no better than a brute or a tree. Harsh words indeed but they are
born out of anguish and meant to rub in the point तरवः किं न
जीवन्ति भस्त्राः किं न श्वसन्त्युत। न खादन्ति न मेहन्ति किं
ग्रामपशवोऽपरे॥

श्वविड्वराहोष्ट्रखरैः संस्तुतः
पुरुषः पशुः । न यत्कर्णपथोपेतो जातु
नाम गदाग्रजः । 
BH(2-3-18 and 19).  ``Do not trees live? Do not bellows breathe? And
do not the domestic animals (other than the human beast) take their
food and indulge in sex? The human beast who has never heard of the
story of the Lord has been declared to be as good as a dog, swine,
a camel and a donkey.''  But the Lord who is an ocean of mercy is ready
to save such a person also if he wants to turn a new leaf and worships
Him with single minded devotion. Krishna says he will be considered
a righteous person. BG(IX-30,31)अपि चेत्सुदुराचारो भजते
मामनन्यभाक्। साधुरेव स मन्तव्यः सम्यग्व्यवसितो

क्षिप्रं भवति धर्मात्मा शश्वच्छान्तिं निगच्छति। कौन्तेय
प्रेतिजानीहि न मे 
भक्तः प्रणश्यति। The bark and
animal skins that Shiva wears proclaim this fact symbolically. They
convey the above assurance that those who turn to Him with devotion
will be saved from repeated births irrespective of the kind of life
they might have lived. So Shiva has the following names भेषजम्-
संसाररोगस्यौषधं भेषजम् VS(578)भवहेतिः- भवः

भजे दिव्यसन्मार्गबन्धुम्।  दिव्य = divine सन्मार्गबन्धुम् = a
companion to one who treads the righteous path भजे = I
worship; means I worship the lord who is a companion to one who takes
to the righteous path. This line provides more than one interpretation.
सन्मार्गः । संश्चासौ मर्गश्च सन्मार्गः । means the virtuous
path: the path trodden by the saints and noble people and that is
in keeping with the shastric injunctions महाजनो येन गतः स
पन्थाः । says Mahabharata. It being very difficult to understand and
interpret the scriptures it is safe to follow the path trodden by the
great men as they have followed the path and realised the results. The
guru, in Vivekachudamani, tells the disciple who had approached him
for instruction that he will show the path which ascetics took for
crossing samsara संसारसिन्धोस्तरणेऽस्त्युपायः । येनैव याताः
यतयोऽस्य पारं तमेव मार्गं
तव निर्दिशामि। 

Krishna says that if one chooses to neglect the path laid out by the
scriptures it will lead to his downfall. So He urges Arjuna to follow
them यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते 
कामकारतः । न स
सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम्। ।
तस्माच्छास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ। ज्ञात्वा
शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि। BG.(16-23,24.) For
those who follow the virtuous path He becomes a friend and guide. But
for those like Ravana, who out of vanity or arrogance choose the
prohibited path He is not a friend but metes out severe punishment
by casting them  into inferior births. 
तानहं द्विषतः क्रूरान्संसारेषु नराधमान् ।
क्षिपाम्यजस्रमशुभानासुरीष्वेव योनिषु। BG(16.19)
Sankaracharya explains ``inferior births'' as cruel beings such as tigers,
lions and the like अजस्रं सन्ततं अशुभान् अशुभकर्मकारिणः
आसुरीष्वेव क्रूरकर्मप्रायासु
व्याघ्रसिंहादिषु योनिषु
क्षिपामि .  Kalidasa prays in the invocatory verse in Malavikagnimitra 
सन्मार्गालोकनाय 
व्यपनयतु स वस्तामसीं वृत्तिमीशः । 
He prays to lord to remove the ignorance born out of lethargy to enable us
to  perceive the right path or the virtuous path.  सत् Sat also means
that which really exists or existence and means brahman अवितथं
परं ब्रह्म सत्, ᳚सदेव   सोम्येदम्᳚  (छा.उ. ६।१।४।) इति
श्रुतेः । VS(478). Thus Margabandhu is brahman only सञ्चासौ
मार्गबन्धुश्च सन्मार्गबन्धुः । Being brahman He is the best
guide and companion one can get on the way to liberation. The path of
self knowledge, says Yama, is very difficult to tread upon. It is just
like walking over the sharp edge of a razor क्षुरस्य धार निशिता
दुरत्यया दुर्गं पथस्तत्कवयो वदन्ति KU(3-14).The knowledge
about the Lord is most profound. The means to get it is difficult for the
unprepared mind.   When one gets struck on the path He (being with us
all the time and very much within us), like a sign post, points the way to
the next stage. He is a guide and companion as long as a seeker looks for
Him. Like the rain bearing clouds He showers His grace on His devotees
without expecting anything in return.  Mundane bandhus (relatives)
are the cause of bondage and ensuing misery. In fact they are called
bandhus only because they bind themselves with us बध्नाति मनः
स्नेहादिना इति But lord Margabandhu is a unique bandhu who causes
all bondage to drop off (as He is Sat) सत्सङ्गत्वे निस्सङ्गत्वम्
says Shri Sankara in Bhajagovindam. So every one prays to Him for getting
free from bondage त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् ।
उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान्मृत्योर्मुक्षीय
मामृतात्। Ignorance
is like a thick layer of scum covering our wisdom. When the scum is
removed the underlying wisdom shines. Wisdom shows the seeker that he is
himself Margabandhu. The seeker realises there is no where to go and the
seeking ends.  So He is known as मार्गः । मुमुक्षवस्तं मार्गयन्ति
इति मार्गः; परमानन्दो येन प्राप्यते स मार्ग
इति वा
VS(365). He is sought by people who want liberation. He is the path
through which one can get infinite bliss. Only by knowing Him liberation
is attained यं विदित्वा 
अमृतत्वाय कल्पन्ते योगिनो मुमुक्षवः
स एव पन्थाः मार्गः । ᳚नान्यः  पन्था
विद्यतेऽयनाय᳚
इति श्रुतेः । VS(397).  The poet says दिव्य सन्मार्गबन्धुम्
Why say  दिव्य divya?  The scriptures talk of the paths the jiva
can take after the fall of the physical body. They are the dark path
(कृष्ण गतिः )
and  the bright path (शुक्लगतिः ). The former path is available to
those who perform duties and sacrifices  prescribed in the vedas. Karmas
may be performed with desires also (known as sakama karma). One may,
for example, perform a sacrifice for achieving wealth or property or
even swarga loka. The karmas done properly produce results without
fail. One who does the prescribed karmas go to world of manes or
pitruloka पितृलोकः after death through the dark path.
One can also do the karmas without any desire (known as
nishkamakarma). They are done as offering to the Lord and the results
are accepted as gifts from Him. Such karmas naturally do not have
a binding effect but result in (चित्तशुद्धिः) purity of the
mind. So, now one with a purified mind can add meditation or upAsana
(उपासना ) on the Lord in any chosen form, that is saguna Iswara,
like Krishna, Rama, Shiva etc. This becomes a powerful combination and
and gives better results(i.e.) they go to devaloka through the  bright
path .These are said to be superior worlds as the pleasures enjoyed
are superior.  एतेषु यश्चरते भ्राजमानेषु यथाकालं
चाहुतयो ह्याददायन् ।
तं नयन्त्येताः सूर्यस्य रश्मयो यत्र
देवानां पतिरेकोधिवासः । MU(1-2-5).  We saw earlier that even
the worlds of gods are finite and so one who attains such a place has
to come down and be reborn after his merits are exhausted. So it is not
considered wise to keep on doing karmas. Those who take to a combination
of karma and upasana can practise austerities and develop mental maturity
and detachmant. They go to Brahmaloka through the bright path
तपःश्रद्धे ये ह्युपवसन्त्यरण्ये शान्ता विद्वांसो भैक्ष्यचर्यां
चरन्तः ।
सूर्यद्वारेण ते विरजाः प्रयान्ति यत्रामृतः स पुरुषो
ह्यव्ययात्मा। MU(1-2-11).  Note the use of the word विद्वांसः ,
that is they are not yet jnAnis but on the way to become a jnAni. A
jnani is liberated while alive in this world itself. He is known as a
jivanmukta (जीवन्मुक्तः ). But those who go to the Brahmaloka study
vedanta at the feet of Brahma. They get realisation. At the time of
pralaya they, along with Brahma merge with brahman. They do not return to
this world. This is what is known as gradual emancipation or kramamukti
(क्रममुक्तिः ). The lord is a companion and guide to those who take
to the bright path that leads to Him.

Meaning of the verse. I worship Lord Margabandhu who is eternal, of
the form of consciousness and bliss, who curbed the pride of Ravana,
who used Meru the golden mountain as a bow, who wears the bark of a
tree and skins and who is a companion to those who choose to tread the
spiritual path leading to liberation.

      ४. कन्दर्पदर्पघ्नमीशं 
      कालकण्ठं महेशं महाव्योमकेशं 
      कुन्दाभदन्तं सुरेशं कोटिसूर्यप्रकाशं 
      भजे मार्गबन्धुम्। शंभो . . .  
      कन्दर्पदर्पघ्नम् -
कंदर्पः = Manmatha, the god of love दर्पः = arrogance,
pride, vanity घ्न = used at the end of a word means destroying,
removing or curing.  So दर्पघ्नं means one who removed or cured
the pride.  Shiva cured or removed the pride of Manmatha, the god of
love.

This statement lends itself for more than one interpretation.
1 - Though formless and without attributes Lord assumes various forms
such as Shiva, Krishna, Rama, Uma, LakShmi etc., to gladden the hearts
of His devotees. Words can not adequately describe the beauty of
these forms. Manmatha is said to be the paragon of beauty. But even
his famed beauty appears drab and insignificant when one thinks of
the lord's bewitching form. Shri Suka describes Krishna as साक्षात्
मन्मथमन्मथः । जगन्मोहनस्य कामस्यापि मनस्युद्भूतः कामः
साक्षात्तस्यापि मोहक इत्यर्थः ।  BH(10-32-2), that is His beauty
will cast a spell on Manmatha himself.So where is the question of
his feeling  proud in the Lord's prescence? In view of this He is
known as 
सुन्दरः । द्वात्रिशल्लक्षणोपेतः सुन्दरः । ᳚कामाय
कामरूपिण᳚ इति श्रुतिः । SS(416). Also सुन्दरः ।
विश्वातिशायिसौभाग्यशालित्वात् सुन्दरः । VS(791). One who is more
beautiful than anyone else 
सुदेहः । शोभनो देहो यस्य स सुदेहः । ᳚मङ्गलायतनं
देवं युवानमतिसुन्दरम्। ध्यायेत्कल्पतरोर्मुले सुखासीनं
सहोमया.'' इति। ᳚शिवान्ये᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(249)
शुभाङ्गः - सुन्दरां तनुं धारयन् शुभाङ्गः । VS(586). Also
शुभाङ्गः - शोभनैरङ्गैर्ध्येयत्वात् शुभाङ्गः । VS(782).
Saints and devotees have lost themselves in singing about the beauty
of the lord. Let us savour some samples.
This description of Shiva is from Navaratnamala by the saint Shri
Sadasivabrahmendra कंदर्पकोटिशतगुणसुन्दरदिव्याकृतिं
शिवं वन्दे Shiva's divine form is millions of times more
beautiful than that of Manmatha.
Likewise the saint Shri Narayana Tirta in his Krishna Leelatarangini
repeatedly calls Krishna as कामकोटिसम,
मनसिजशतकोटिमञ्जुलवेष, मीनाङ्ककोटिमोहन,
कोटिमदनसुन्दर, जगन्मोहन , that is Krishna is millions of
times more beautiful than Manmatha. Such being the case his beauty is
completely eclipsed in the prescence of the Lord: just like the
feeble light of the stars is lost in the blazing light of the sun.
Let us look at another example. This one is from Shri
Krishnakarnamrutam by Lilasukha. He is amazed at the sweet form of
Krishna and could only exclaim ``Oh! He is sweet,sweet, the very
embodiment of sweetness.'' 
मधुरं मधुरं वपुरस्य विभो-र्मधुरं मधुरं वदनं
मधुरम्।
मधुगन्धि मृदुस्मित-मेतदहो मधुरं मधुरं मधुरं
मधुरम्। 
Shri Vedanta Desika should have had the same sentiment as Shri DikShita
and addresses the lord at Tirupathy as कन्दर्पदर्पहर सुन्दर
दिव्यमूर्ते! ``the One whose beautiful form destroys the
pride of Manmatha'' (in Venkatesa suprabatam).
The use of the word कन्दर्पः for Manmatha is significant. The
name means that he was proud right from birth. Even the pride of such
a being vanishes in the prescence of the Lord.
2 - We are in the habit of describing things that have no defined
form or have no form as beautiful if they please our senses. Thus we
say the weather is beautiful or a smell is beautiful when it is is
pleasing to our senses. Similarly we describe the nature, for example
the sun rise, as beautiful because it is colourful and it is also
cool at that time. We do not call the scene beautiful after a couple
of hours when the sun is sizzling! In the same way we describe the
formless Lord as beautiful as He confers bliss on us. Further weather
etc., can give happiness in a very limited manner, that is for a
limited time or in a limited quantity only. Soon they tend to pall or
they will turn sour. So we may not call them really pleasing.
Considering this Krishna says
ये हि संस्पर्सजा भोगा दुःखयोनय एव ते  ।
आद्यन्तवन्तः कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुधः । BG(5-22) .
In sharp contrast the Lord is of the form of unlimited bliss and so
infinitely beautiful. And it never gets stale. One never gets sated
with looking at the form. Lilasukha is charmed by Krishna's form and
describes it in his  Shri Krishnakarnamrutam thus:  
प्रतिपदललिताभ्यां, प्रत्यहं नूतनाभ्यां,
प्रतिमुहुरधिकाभ्याम् It appears beautiful every time one looks at
it. It seems ever fresh and  more lovely than it appeared last time
when one saw it.
So He is known as सुचारुः - सुतरां दर्शनीयश्चारुः,
निरतिशय-परमानन्दरूपत्वात्। ᳚विज्ञानमानन्दं
ब्रह्मे᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(818). and रम्यः -
सुखरूपत्वाद्रम्यः । ᳚यो वै भूमा तत्सुखमि᳚ति
श्रुतिः । SS(924).
Devi Lalita is known as सर्वाङ्गसुन्दरी - सर्वाणि च तानि
अङ्गानि च अवयवाः शिरःपाण्यादयः;
तेष्वन्यूनानतिरिक्तभाववत्त्वात् यथासामुद्रिका-लक्षणं तद्वत्वेन
सर्वाङ्गसुन्दरी। अथवा सर्वेषामङ्गेषु शरीरेषु
ब्रह्मस्वरूपतया अत्यन्तप्रेमविषयत्वेन
सुन्दरपदार्थवदविनाभाववाञ्छाविषयत्वात्
तथा।  (Lalitatrishati No. 130, Shankara's commentary).
3 - At a different level we may say that Manmatha was not destroyed
really as it is said. He came on a mission but failed miserably.  But
Shiva was in total control of Himself and so could not be shaken. He
has many names that attest this fact. Some of them are:  
शान्तः - विषयसुखेष्वसङ्गतया शान्तः, ᳚निष्कलं
निष्क्रियं शान्तम्᳚ (श्वे. उ.६।१९) इति श्रुतेः । VS(582)
and SS(9)विरागः - विरतो रागो यस्य विरागः ।
᳚कथमनेनेदृशेन निश्चिनोती᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(89).
विरतः - विगतं रतमस्य विषयसेवायामिति विरतः । 
VS(396)दमः - दमोऽस्यास्तीति दमः । निगृहीतेन्द्रियग्राम
इत्यर्थः । आत्मारामत्वात्। ᳚न हि स्वात्मारामं
विषयमृगतृष्णा भ्रमयति᳚ इति शिवरहस्ये॥

᳚नीलकन्ठं प्रशान्तमि᳚ ति श्रुतिः । SS(578). Thus
Manmatha was no match to Shiva. He totally lost himself in the
prescence of Shiva. This is said to be the destruction of Manmatha.
Shiva's anger was a flash and disappeared soon after as is wont with
noble souls सधूनां क्षणिको कोपः ।  The punishment was a token.
Shiva yielded to Rati's pleadings and brought Manmatha back to life as
he has a role to play in the creation 
ईशं - The lord or master, one who is in complete control.
Relating to the preceding episode of Manmatha this epithet fits Shiva
perfectly as He conquered him who was famed to be invincible in all
the three worlds. He made Manmatha feel small and acknowledge Shiva's
overwhelming superiority 
कालकण्ठम् - काल = black or dark-blue colour कण्ठः = throat.
This means one whose throat has a dark colour. It refers to
Shiva whose throat has a bluish hue. This is said to have happened
after he swallowed the poison that was given out by the serpent
Vasuki when the ocean was churned by the devas and asuras. Like
Manmatha in the episode narrated above, the poison also  lost its
virulence and became impotent in Shiva's prescence. So Shiva has the
following names 
नीलखण्ठः - नीलः कण्ठे यस्य सः नीलकण्ठः । शिवस्य कण्ठे
नैल्यं
विष्ण्वादि-सकलप्राण्यार्तिकर-हलाहल-विषधारणप्रयुक्तम्।---᳚नीलक्ण्ठं
प्रशान्तमि᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(5). The name नीलग्रीवः for
Shiva appears in several places in Shri Rudram. Also: 
श्रीकण्ठः - श्रीः कालकूटजनिता शोभा। तद्वान्कण्ठो यस्य सः ।
तथा कालकूट-जनित-मालिन्यमपि शोभैव परमेश्वरस्य।
᳚विकारोऽपि श्लाघ्यो भुवन-भयभङ्ग-व्यसनिन᳚
इति न्यायात्। अथवा श्रीः विषमेव,  ᳚श्रीर्वेषरचना शोभा
सम्पत्सरलशाखिषु।वाणीलक्ष्मीलवङ्गेषु विषे बिल्वेऽपी᳚ति
नानार्तरत्नमाला। तद्वान्कण्ठो यस्येति। SS(118) and SA(16). This
says that even the dark patch generated by the poison added to the
beauty of Shiva's throat. This is said in the following verse in the
Shivamahimna Stotram also 
अकाण्डब्रह्माण्डक्षयचकितदेवासुरकृपा-
विधेयस्याऽऽसीद् यस्त्रिनयन विषं संहृतवतः ।
स कल्माषः कण्ठे तव न कुरुते न श्रियमहो
विकारोऽपि श्लाघ्यो भुवनभयभङ्गव्यसनिनः ॥१४। 

The following names of Shiva are based on this incident. 
कालकूटविषादी - हालाहल- विषपानकर्ता कालकूटविषादी ।
स्कान्दे सनत्कुमारसंहितायां काशिकावनमाहात्म्ये विष्ण्वादिना
समुद्रमथनं, तदानीं वासुकिमुखात्कालविषोत्पादनं, तेन
ग्लानिः, तदनु तैर्विषनिग्रहार्तं शिवं प्रति प्रार्थना,
तदनु शिवप्रेरीतेन---नाम्ना हस्तेन विषमाहृत्य च
शिवहस्ते जंबूफलवत्समर्पणं, तदनु- ᳚गृहीत्वा
भुक्तवाञ्छंभुः कण्ठे नीलोऽभवत्तदा।
तदाप्रभृति तत्स्थानं हालाशनमिति स्मृतम्।
शिवोऽभूत्कालभुङ्नाम्ना कालक्ण्ठाख्यकोऽभवदि᳚ति। 
SS(203).
The story of churning of the ocean is mentioned in the puranas. It
appears in 8th book of Shrimad Bhagavatam. Some verses from this are
given for reference 
निर्मथ्यमानादुदधेरभूद् विषं महोल्बणं
हालाहलाह्वमग्रतः ।संभ्रान्तमीनोन्मकराहिकच्छपात्
तिमिद्विपग्राहतिमिङ्गिलाकुलात्।
तमुग्रवेगं दिशि दिश्युपर्यधो विसर्पदुत्सर्पदसह्यमप्रति।
भीताः प्रजा दुद्रुवुरङ्ग सेश्वरा अरक्ष्यमाणाः शरणं
सदाशिवम्। 
``Seeing that effervescent, unbearable and irresistible poison
possessing tremendous force and spreading in all quarters, as well as
above and below, and finding no protection (anywhere), living beings
along with their leaders got much frightened and flew for protection
to Lord Sadasiva (the ever-auspicious one).'' They prayed to Shiva
to protect them. They said 
देव देव महादेव भूतात्मन् भूतभावन। त्राहि नः
शरणापन्नांस्त्रैलोक्यदहनात् विषात्॥ 
``O god of gods! O supreme deity! the protector, nay, the very
self of all created beings! save us who have sought refuge in You,
from this poison that is burning all the three worlds.''
Shiva saw their plight 
तद् वीक्ष्य व्यसनं तासां कृपया भृशपीडितः ।
सर्वभूतसुहृद् देव इदमाह सतीं प्रियाम्। Shiva  who was the
embodiment of mercy was very much affected by their plight and told
His consort Sati this 
अहो बत भवान्येतत् प्रजानां पश्य वैशसम्। क्षीरोदमथनोद्भूतात्
कालकूटादुपस्थितम्। 
``How distressing it is, O Bhavani, this calamity that has come
up on these people from the poison Kalakuta that had appeared during
the churning of the ocean of milk.''
आसां प्राणपरीप्सूनां विधेयमभयं हि मे। एतावान् हि
प्रभोरर्थो यद् दीनपरिपालनम्। 
``Protection must be given by me to these people who are
concerned about their lives. To protect the afflicted is the main
concern of the great (who is endowed with power).'' Saying this
Shiva swallowed the poison He had gathered in His hand 
निशम्य कर्म तच्छंभोः देवदेवस्य मीढुषः । प्रजा दक्षायणी
ब्रह्मा वैकुण्ठश्च शशंसिरे। 
Observing the benevolent act of Lord Shiva those who approached Him,
Sati, Brahma and Lord Vishnu praised it.

Refering to this episode of Shiva swallowing the poison and the
wearing Ganga on His head, the author Shri DikShita says that the Lord
performed these acts not because the poison was tasty or Ganga has
purifying power : but only to save the world and because of extreme
compassion. And these two acts could not have been performed by
anyone else 
गङ्गा धृता न भवता शिव पावनीति नास्वादितो मधुर इत्यपि
कालकूटः ।
संरक्षणाय जगतां करुणातिरेका-त्कर्मद्वयं

महेशम् -  महा is a substitute for महत् meaning big or
great ईशः is synonymous with ईश्वरः and means lord or
master महेशः is the name of Shiva महांश्चासावीशश्च
महेशः । ᳚यः परः स महेश्वरः᳚ इति
श्रुतिः । SS(26)महेश्वरः -

other gods like Yama may be lords of their respective quarters and
have powers but the Shiva is their Lord also. Their lordships and
powers were given by Him only. And it is to Him only they all rush
for protection when they see a danger to all, as happened in the
story just narrated.
Later on it is said अतः इतरदेवतासाध्यकार्यप्रवर्तकतया
सर्वत्राप्रतिहतत्वात् महदीशितृत्वमस्येति महेश्वर इति
स्मृउतः इति। इदं च श्रुतिप्रसिद्धं नाम, ᳚मायिनं तु

महाव्योमकेशम् - महत् =  great or big व्योमन् = sky,
atmosphere व्योमकेशः is an epithet of Shiva 
व्योमकेशः    गङ्गाधारणसमये व्योमवद्विशालजटावलयरूपः
केशः अस्येति व्योमकेशः । SS(96) and SA(75).
While receiving the Ganga when she was coming down from the heavens,
Shiva spread out His hair which appeared to cover the sky. Hence the
name. It is also one of Lalita's name व्योमकेशी - व्योमैव
केशा यस्या विराड्रूपतयाः । व्योमकेशस्य शिवस्य स्त्री वा।
व्योमैवाल्पं सद्व्योमकम्। अल्पार्थे कप्रत्ययः । तस्येशी ततोऽपि
व्यापिका वा LS(941). Her (universal form) is larger than the sky.
This is an additional meaning given for the name and is applicable to
Shiva also. Because the sky was first created and came from Him only.
Then other things were created from the sky.Thus Ganga came from the
same source from which the entire creation started and so the river
occupies a lofty position in our esteem. Besides it has an unique
sacredness attached to it that is not attached to any other river or
even to the rain water that falls from the sky. In fact the rain
water is considered to be ordinary. It stays for a short time and is
lost: but Ganga's flow is perennial and is symbolic of His grace.
Ganga came from the heaven. Her waters came in a big torrent. Because
the water fell from a great height the stream got scattered into fine
spray and came down as an immense cloud. Shiva spread out His hair to
cover the sky so that the cloud of spray got in and was trapped.
Ganga lost her way and could not come out. This was done to curb her
pride. She was released again when Bagiratha prayed to Shiva.
The use of the adjective महा in the word महाव्योमकेशम् 
meaning great or big is significant महाव्योम meaning ``the
big or the great sky'' is said to distinguish it from the
``small sky'' that is mentioned in the Upanishads.  
अथ यदिद-मस्मिन् ब्रह्मपुरे दहरं पुण्दरीकं वेश्म
दहरोऽस्मिन्नन्तराकाश-स्तस्मिन् यदन्त-स्तदन्वेष्टव्यं तद्वव
विजिञासितव्यमिति। Chandogyopanishad.(8-1-1). What is mentioned
here is known as Dahara Vidya. Ordinarily people may may find it to
visualise brahman that is described to be without a form, name or any
other attributes. It may appear to be something like a vacUm. It is
the intention of Dahara Vidya to provide them something gross on
which they can meditate upon.
Daharam means  small (दहरं अल्पं ) and ब्रह्मपुरं is
our body. Briefly stated this says that there is a small space within
the heart in the body in which one can visualise brahman and get all
his desires fulfilled. The upanishad says that this is because the
space that is inside the heart encompasses all that is there outside.
कुन्दाभदन्तम् - कुंदम् = jasmine flower आभः = likeness,
resemblance दन्तः  tooth. Shiva's teeth are white and
have the luster or the soft glow like the jasmine flower. They are
uniform and packed closely like the petals of a jasmine flower. They
are specifically mentioned as they are in the mouth of the Lord that
is the birthplace of all sounds, grammar and the vedas. It is said
that the vedas are the very breath of the Lord. Shiva has several
names based on this fact. Some are given here 
वाग्विशुद्धः - वाचो वाण्यो विशुद्धा ऋग्वेदादयो यस्य सः
वाग्विशुद्धः । ᳚अस्य महतो भूतस्य

Thus the sacred vedas in the form of His breath are always wafting in
His mouth and are in constant touch with His teeth making them very
pure and endowing them with unique sacredness. For these reasons the
comparison of the teeth with the jasmine flower is to be found often
in the compositions of the saints and devotees. Some examples are
given here. Shri Narayana Theertha addresses Krishna as
कुन्दरदन and कुन्दसुन्दररदन in his Krishna Leela
Tarangini. (रदः = tooth.) This description of Devi's teeth is
in Shyamala Dandakam.
कुन्दपुष्पद्युतिस्निग्धदन्तावलीनिर्मलालोलकल्लोलसंमेलनस्मेरशोणाधरे!
सुरेशं - सुरः = god or deity. Shiva is the lord of gods like
Indra, Brahma. He could ward off Yama also. Thus all the gods could
not assess and understand His greatness and glory.  That is why they
were naive enough to plan and send Manmatha on that infamous mission.
He was also worshipped by asuras like Ravana who subjugated the
devas. He could crush Ravana and make him realise his helplessness
and finally surrender to Him.There is none equal to Him or greater
than Him. So Shri Suka salutes Him saying this 
निरस्तसाम्यातिशयेन राधसा स्वधामनि ब्रह्मणि रंस्यते
नमः । BH(2-4-14)निरस्तं सांयमतिशयश्च यस्य यदपेक्षया
अन्यस्य साम्यमतिशयश्च नास्ति, तेन राधसा ऐश्वर्येण
स्वधामनि स्वस्वरूपे ब्रह्मणि रममाणाय (Shridhara's
commentary). Shri Sadasiva Brahmendra bows to Him saying
(in Navaratnamala- 12) निस्तुलमहिमानमानतोऽस्मि शिवम्।
तुलनं = comparison. So he says ``I salute Shiva of
incomparable glory.'' 
कोटिसूर्यप्रकाशम् - कोटि = 10 millions प्रकाश brilliant,
bright, shining. The Lord shines like a million (infinite) suns.
There are so many suns and stars in the universe. The Lord gives them
their brightness and He also shines because of His own glory without
depending on anyone else. So He has these names 
सूर्यकोटिप्रतीकाशः - सूर्यकोटीनं प्रकाश इव प्रकाशो यस्य सः

Thus the Lord who is brighter than a million suns, who is eternal and
never failing is the most dependable one to light our way. Let us
pray to Him and seek His grace. So भजे =I worship
मर्गबन्धुम् = the Lord Margabandhu.
I worship Lord Margabandhu who removed Manmatha's pride, who has kept
poison in His neck, the great Lord who is more extensive than the
space, whose teeth have the sheen of the jasmine flower, who is the
Lord of the gods and who shines like millions of suns.

      शंभो .. 
This is the fifth and the last verse in the stotram to be followed by
the
फलश्रुतिः , a verse that states the benefit of reciting the
stotram.
The preceding verses referred to some incidents to be
found in the puranas. These incidents were used to highlight some
qualities of Shiva. They also mentioned some aspects of His form, like
the moon and Ganga on His head.  Of course the references are to His
सगुण aspect or aspect with name and form as Shiva. In His
निर्गुण aspect He is without name, form and qualities. These
references brought out the greatness of the Lord like His compassion,
readiness to come to the help of the distressed etc. Thus, He
destroyed Manmatha because he commited a serious offence. But when
entreated by Rati (Manmatha's wife) He readily granted his life back.
This shows His infinite compassion.
Whatever be the name or form by which we choose to address Him, be it
Shiva or Rama or Hari, we find that His qualities  are endearing and
draw one to Him. Shri Kulasekara states this in this popular verse in
his Mukundamala (No:18) as follows 
वात्सल्या-दभयप्रदानसमया-दार्तार्ति-निर्वापणात् 
औदार्या-दघशोषणा-दगणित-श्रेयःपदप्रापणात् । 
सेव्यः श्रीपतिरेक एव सततं सन्त्यत्र षट् साक्षिणः 
प्रह्लादश्च विभीषणश्च करिराट् पाञ्चाल्यहल्या ध्रुवः ॥ 
मन्दारभूतेरुदारं -
मन्दारः = It is the name of one of the five trees in Indira's
paradise. It is said to be capable of granting one's desires like the
famed Kalpa tree, also of the paradise भूतिः = grandeur,
dignity, riches उदारम् = generous, liberal. So the word 
मन्दारभूतेरुदारं means that Lord Shiva is more generous in
granting one's wishes than the Mandara tree. So He is known as
कामप्रदः - भक्तेभ्यः कामान् प्रकर्षेण ददातीति कामप्रदः । 
VS(298). He gives all that His devotees may need in abundance. Shri
Vedanta Desika cites the case of Kuchela as an example and says
धानामुष्टिमुचे कुचेलमुनये दत्ते च वित्तेशताम् । meaning
that He made His devotee Kuchela rich as Kubera in return for a
handful of pounded rice he offered Him.
He is also known as वरदः - अभिमतान् वरान् ददातीति वरदः । 
VS(330). He grants boons desired from Him. Also वरदः
भक्तानामिष्टप्रदः । ᳚वरदं देवमीड्य᳚ मिति
श्रुतिः । SS(107). And उदारः - भक्ताऽभीष्टदः
सर्वोत्कृष्ट
उदारः । ᳚आप्ततममुत्कृष्टतम᳚ मिति श्रुतिः । 
SS(315).
Saint Sadasiva Brahmendra calls Him as नतमन्दार       -
``the
wishing tree of heaven'' in his song भज रे गोपालम् - Bhaja
re Gopalam. Again he calls Him as सेवकजनमन्दिरमन्दार -
``the Mandara tree planted in the residential quarters of His
devotees'' in the song मानस संचर रे - Manasa sanchara
re.
We find the mantra नमो वृक्षेभ्यो हरिकेशेभ्यः in the eighth
anuvaka of Shri Rudram. The explanation states that Rudra, who can
take any form, has assumed the form of trees to help the world. He
stands in the form of Palasa, Bilwa, Peepal and  other holy trees
which can be used in sacrifices for gaining heaven and the form of
heavenly trees like Kalpaka, Mandara, Parijata etc., which grant all
wishes. So He gets the following names 
पारिजातः - पारमस्यास्तीति पारि, समुद्रः, तस्माज्जातः पारिजातः
देववृक्षः, तद्रूपत्वाद्देवोऽपि पारिजातः, भक्तजनेष्टद
इत्यर्तः । SS(264) and वृक्षाणां पतिः - वृक्षा
अश्वत्थादयः,
तेषां पतिः स्वामी । ᳚वृक्षाणां पतये नम॑ इति श्रुतिः ।

SS(692).
The tree is one of the creations. May be it is in the heaven and so
has some special features unlike those found here in this world. But
places like the heaven are only finite. Gods like Indra who rule
there are also finite though they may be known as अमराः . The
tree Mandara also has a limited life. Since it has only a limited
life, whatever it can give will also have limited life and perish
eventually giving cause for unhappiness or sorrow. In view of this
Krishna names those who seek petty favours (which are finite only)
from Mandara and even gods like Indra, Brahma etc.,  as men of small
intellect. He says 
अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भवत्यल्पमेधसाम् । BG(7-23).
Sankaracharya, in his commentary, points out that एवं समाने अपि
आयासे मामेव न प्रतिपद्यन्ते अनन्तफलाय, अहो खलु कष्ठतरं
वर्तते, इत्यनुक्रोशं दर्शयति भगवान् । ``though there
is
the same amount of exertion (in the two kinds of worship), people do
not resort to Me so that they may attain infinite results. Alas! it
is very miserable'' -thus the Lord expresses His anguish. This is
the reason for calling them as ``men of small intellect.''
But, unlike the tree, the Lord is नित्यः eternal as said in verse
No. 3. He is not subject to decay etc., as the tree. So He is capable
of granting finite material benefits like good health, wealth etc..

besides  liberation or mokSha (i.e.) that is ever lasting or
infinite. In fact He is willing to give Himself to His devotee.
स्मरतः पादकमल-मात्मानमपि यच्छति । BH(10-80-11). This
idea is repeated by Shri Kulasekara in his Mukundamala (31)सेव्ये
स्वस्य पदस्य दातरि सुरे नारायणे तिष्टति । The infinite thing
obviously includes the finite things. The true devotees know this and
so do not seek benefits that are finite from Him. The Lord
is very dear to them and they are very dear to Him प्रियो हि
ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रियः । BG(7-17). So He
naturally  takes care of them. Has not He said तेषां
नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ? ``To them who are
ever devout, I secure them gain and safety.'' BG(9-22). Here
योगः and क्षेमः ``gain and safety'' is explained by
Shri Sankara as योगः अप्राप्तस्य प्रापणं, क्षेमः तद्रक्षणं,
तदुभयं प्रापयामि अहम् । . (i.e.) Gain implies securing what is
not already possessed; and safety means preservation of what is
alreday possessed. Shri Sankara adds that while the lesser devotees
work themselves for  their gain and safety the true devotees do not.
The Lord alone is their refuge. Wherefore the Lord Himself secures to
them gain and safety केवलं एव भगवच्छरणाः ते; अत
भगवान् एव तेषां योगक्षेमं वहतीति । . Thus the true devotees
do not lack anything. If their be any lack, it is taken care of by
the Lord. The safety of their possessions is also taken care of by
the Lord. What more can one desire?  They are carefree and therefore
relaxed. The Tamil saint Manikkavachakar said that the Lord was more
concerned about him than the mother of her new born child. He said
that He anticipated his needs and fulfilled them. The brahmin Kuchela
was another such devotee. Outwardly he appeared to be very poor but
inwardly he was very rich: he  was totally contented and never felt
any want यदृच्छ्योपपन्नेन वर्तमानो गृहाश्रमी । 
BH(10-80-7).
मन्दरागेन्द्रसारम् -
मन्दरः = is the name of a mythical mountain अगः = mountain.
इन्द्रः = the first or the best (of any class of objects). So the
word मन्दरागेन्द्र means Mandara, the best among the mountains.
सारं = strength.
Mandara was used by the gods  and demons to churn the ocean to get
the nectar. It is said to be situated adjacent to the mountain Meru.
मन्दरो मेरुमन्दरः सुपार्श्वः कुमुद इति अयुतयोजन विस्तारोन्नाहा
मेरोश्चतुर्दिशमवष्टम्भ गिरय उपकॢप्ताः । Of the four
sides
of Mount Meru stand the Mandara, Merumandara, Suparswa and Kumuda
mountains forming its buttresses (as it were) and having a length and
height of 10,000 yojanas. BH(5-16-10). Shiva is said to be as strong
as Mandara, the best among the mountains. He is unmovable, like a
mountain सर्वगतः स्थाणुः अचलः - सर्वगतत्वात् स्थाणुः इव
स्थिरः इत्येतत् । स्थिरत्वात् अचलः अयं आत्मा । Because He is
all
pervading, He is stable like a pillar. Because He is stable He is
firm.BG(2-24). The proof is that the mighty Ravana tried to lift His
abode Kailasa and was crushed. But His unlimited strength is not
demoniac but it is mellowed with kindness: so when Ravana realised
his mistake and pleaded, He pardoned him and let him go. So He is
known as महाबलः- बलिनामपि बलवत्त्वात् महाबलः । He is
stronger than those who are said to possess great strength.
VS(172)
महाबलपरः- महद्बलं शारीरं सामर्थ्यं सैन्यरूपं वा
येषां ते महाबलाः, इन्द्रोपेन्द्रप्रभृतयः तेषां परः
श्रेष्ठः परमेश्वरः । ᳚तमीश्वराणां परमं
महेश्वर᳚मिति श्रुतिः । SS(604). In fact He is known as 
अद्रिः- अद्रिवदप्रकम्प्यः, परैरचल इति यावत् । ᳚तं
शान्तमचल᳚मिति श्रुतिः । यद्वा
श्रीशैलारुणाचलादिपर्वतरूपत्वादद्रिः । श्रीशैलशिखरं

महीधरः- महीं गिरिरूपेण धरतीति महीधरः, ᳚वनानि
विष्णुर्गिरयो दिशश्च᳚ (विष्णु-२-१२-३८) इति
पराशरोक्तेः । VS(369). He held up Mandara during the churning of
the ocean and lifted the Govardana mountain as Krishna. So He gets
the name महाद्रिधृक्- महान्तमद्रिं गिरिं मन्दरं
गोवर्दनं च अमृतमथने गोरक्षणे च धृतवानिति
महाद्रिधृक् ॥ VS(180).
The fact that He is mightier than the mightiest and has compassion
makes Him the ideal protector.  Shri Vedanta Desika has expressed this
idea beautifully in his works 
अभीति हेतोरनुवर्तनीयं नाथ त्वदन्यं न विभावयामि । 
भयं कुतः स्यात् त्वयि सानुकंपे रक्षा कुतः स्यात् त्वयि जातरोषे ॥ 
(Ashtabhujashtakam - 5)
त्वयि रक्षति रक्षकैः किमन्यैः त्वयि चारक्षति रक्षकैः किमन्यैः । 
इति निश्चित धीः श्रयामि नित्यं नृहरे वेगवती तटाश्रयं त्वाम् ॥ 
(Shri Kamasikashtakam - 8). 
He asks: ``When one is protected by You what use is there of
other protectors? Again,
when You are angry and decide to punish someone, what use is there of
other protectors?''  This reminds us of the famous incident of
Kakasura in Ramayana.
The asura misbehaved with Sita when she was in the forest with Rama.
Rama was furious at his conduct and sent an arrow that chased him
wherever he went. He ran to Indra, Brahma etc., for protection.
But they hurriedly turned him away when they
learnt that he had incurred Rama's wrath and is being hunted by
Rama's arrow. Finally, feeling helpless, he surrendered to Rama
Himself who forgave him readily. This incident was mentioned by Sita
to Hanuman. She said 
त्रीन् लोकान् संपरिक्रम्य तमेव शरणं गतः । 
स तं निपतितं भूमौ शरण्यः शरणागतम् । 
वधार्हमपि काकुत्स्थः कृपयापर्यपालयत् ॥ 
(Ramayana. Sundara Kanda. 38-32,3). 
Great asuras like Ravana obtained wonderful boons from Brahma and
other gods.  With those powers they could subdue the three worlds.
They were very proud of their powers and were convinced they were
invincible and safe. But in the end they found themselves helpless
when their time was up. Ravana bemoans this fact when he sees his
army being decimated in the fight with Rama 
अहो सुबलवान् रामो महदस्त्रबलं च वै । 
यस्य विक्रममासाद्य राक्षसा निधनं गताः । 
तं मन्ये राघवं वीरं नारायणमनामयम् ॥ (Yuddha kanda
72-10,11). 
In contrast young devotees like Prahlada were under His protection.
They faced trials and tribulations with the assurance that the Lord
will protect them. So no harm could befall them.
We also referred to the episode of Markandeya being saved by Shiva
from the jaws of death and mentioned that one of His names is
मृत्युञ्जयः SS(123) and SA(71). Shri Ramana Maharshi explains
how the Lord Mrityunjaya saves His devotees from death. He puts it in
a unique way in his work Sat-darsanam. He says 
मृत्युञ्जयं मृत्युभियाश्रिताना- 
महंमतिर्मृत्युमुपैति पूर्वम् । 
अथ स्वभावादमृतेषु तेषु 
कथं पुनर्मृत्युधियोऽवकाशः ॥ 
The Maharshi says that when a devotee seeks the protection of the
Lord from fear of death He protects him by destroying the individual!
This sounds alarming and confusing. But what the Maharshi means is
that normally one identifies himself with the body-mind complex and
not the Self that is one's true nature. Thus the individual feels
separate from the Self which is immortal and not subject to
destruction. This separative idea is formed in the individual's mind.
As long as one cherishes this mistaken notion one is in the grip of
the viscious samsara. He is subject to repeated birth and death. This
wrong notion that makes one to identify himself with the body is
known as ahamkara or ego. When one surrenders himself to Lord
Mrityunjaya who is very much in everyones heart the ahamkara loses
itself. It is only a chimera that thrives as long as one's ignorance
of his true nature persists. The Lord's grace confers the wisdom that
destroys the ignorance. Consequently the ego gets stripped of all its
coverings and ceases to be the ego. Rid of the ego the Self shines in
its pristine glory. The individual finds his original nature and thus
he goes beyond birth and death. He  becomes immortal.
महागौर्यदूरम्- महा = great गौरी = is the name of
Parvati महागौरी means great or glorious Gauri अदूरम् = close
by, not far away दूर = distant or far off.
Gauri or Parvati is the consort of Shiva and is said to take up half
of His body. In view of this it is said here that She is not far off
from Him. So Shiva is known as अर्धनारीश्वरः- नार्या अर्धं
अर्धनारी, अर्धनारीमिलित ईश्वरः अर्धनारीश्वरः ।
नार्यंशोऽर्धमीश्वरांशश्चार्धमित्यर्तः ।
तदुक्तमाचार्यैः-

᳚दरिद्रन्नीललोहोत᳚ इति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(568).
Krishna has said पिताऽहमस्य जगतो माता धाता पितामहः ।  
BG(9-17).
``I am tha father of this world, the mother, the dispenser of the
fruits of action and the grandsire.'' That He is both the father
and the mother is symbolised by the Ardhanari form. Kalidasa says
this in the invocatory verse to his great poem Raghuvamsam 
वागर्थाविव संपृक्तौ वागर्थप्रतिपत्तये । 
जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ ॥ 
``I salute Parvati and Parameswara who are the parents of the
universe and who are inseparably united like the speech and the
sense, for obtaining the correct knowledge of the words and their
meaning.''
Thus Krishna says that He is both the intelligent cause and the
material cause of the creation. He is
कत्रा - क्रियत इति कर्म जगत्तस्य कर्ता, ᳚यो वै बालाक
एतेषां पुरुषाणं कर्ता यस्य वै तत् कर्म स वेदितव्यः ।''
कौ-उ-४-१४ इति श्रुतेः । VS(316).
करणं - जगदुत्पत्तौ साधकं करणम् । VS(378)
कारणं - उपादानं निमित्तं च कारणम् । VS(379)
विकर्ता - विविधं भुवनं क्रियते इति विकर्ता स एव भगवान्
विष्णुः । VS(381).
The material cause is also known as prakriti which Krishna called as
His inferior aspect in BG Chapter 7. Prakriti is also called maya
that deluding power of Iswara 
मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं तु महेश्वरम् । SVU(4-10).
Prakriti is maya and the Lord Maheswara is in control of it.
Krishna says that His maya is very powerful and very hard to
overcome दैवी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया । BG(7-14).
``This divine illusion of Mine, made up of gunas, is hard to
surmount.'' So He is known as महामायः - मायाविनामपि
मायाकारित्वात् महामायः, ᳚मम माया दुरत्यया᳚ इति
भगवद्वचनात् । VS(170).
Krishna says that in fact He is both: the intelligent cause and the
material cause called prakriti. Thus मूलप्रकृतिः is one of His
names मूलभूता प्रकृतिः मूलप्रकृतिः, जगदादिकारणं,
तन्निमित्तोपादानत्मकं ब्रह्मेत्यर्तः । ᳚तदैक्षत, बहुस्यां
प्रजायेति᳚ इति श्रुतिः ॥

ऐक्षतेति ईक्षणकर्तृत्वान्निमित्तकारणत्वं, बहुस्यामिति
बहुभवनहेतुत्वादुपादानत्वम् ॥ SS(411). Also प्रकृतिः -
जगदुपादानभूतः परमेश्वरः प्रकृतिः । अयमर्तः सूत्रकारेण
निश्चितः ।प्रकृतिश्च प्रतिज्ञा,
दृष्टान्तानुपरोधादित्यादिसूत्रपञ्चकेन । विवृतं चेदं
भाष्यकारेण संशयपूर्वपक्षप्रदर्शनपूर्वकम् ॥ SS(570)
मायाबीजः - मायाया बीजं कारणमधिष्ठानमिति यावत् । एवं च
मायाया अध्यस्तत्वेन वास्तवताऽभावात् शक्तित्वेन
स्वातन्त्र्याभावाच्च जगत ईश्वरैक्यबीजत्वमुपपद्यते ।
᳚देवात्मशक्तिं स्वगुणैर्निगूढामि᳚ ति
श्रुतिः ॥ SS(557).
The prakriti mentioned as the mother is symbolised as the Lord's
consort and is variously called as Parvati, Ambika, Gauri, Bhavani,
LakShmi etc..  प्रकृति, विष्णुपत्नी, नारायणसमाश्रिता are
names of LakShmi to be seen in LakShmi Ashtottarashatanama stotram.
Thus
the Lord as brahman is one but, as Iswara and Devi appears as two.
This is stated beautifully in the उमामहेश्वरस्तोत्रम् 
(Umamaheswara stotram) as follows 
नमः शिवाभ्यां नवयौवनाभ्यां परस्पराश्लिष्टवपुर्धराभ्याम् । 
I salute the two Shivas who are eternally young and whose bodies are
entwined with each other.
Krishna also adds that we the created beings are in the clutches of
prakriti and go through the cycle of birth and death till wisdom
dawns on us but He is beyond it and maya, however powerful it may be
has no influence on Him. So He is known as 
मायातीतः - मायाया अतीतः - मायया वा अतीतः । 
सत्वादि-गुण-सामान्यरूप-प्रकृतिविवर्जित इत्यर्तः । 
᳚अतमस्कममायमि᳚ति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(41). and 
निर्मायः - मायाया निर्गतः निर्मायः । यद्यपि ᳚मायां तु
प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं तु महेश्वरं᳚ इति मायासंबन्दः
श्रुतिषु दृश्यते, तथापि मायायाः कल्पितत्वेन
वास्तवसंबन्धाभावात् कल्पितसंबन्धपरेयं श्रुतिः । अत
एव,
व्यक्तात्पुरुषः परः, अक्षरात्परतरः, अविद्याकार्यहीनः ।
᳚अतमस्कम्मायमि᳚ति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(693).
Bartruhari states the fact that the Lord is not in the clutches of
maya in his own way in his Vairagyasatakam.(17) 
एको रागिषु राजते प्रियतमादेहार्धहारी हरो
नीरागेषु जनो विमुक्तललनासङ्गो न यस्मात् परः ।  
He says that among sensual persons Shiva is unique sharing half His
body with His beloved. It appears from this that as though He cannot
bear separation from her even for a second. But, he adds, that again
among the dispassionate there is none superior to Him, unattached to
the company of women.
The prakriti is subservient to Him. This is depicted in our puranas
by showing Parvati and LakShmi as serving the Lord with great
dedication. For example, Devahuti, the daughter of Manu, is said to
have served her husband, sage Kardama, with the same delight as
Goddess Parvati looks after Her consort, Lord Shiva नित्यं
पर्यचरत् प्रीत्या भवानीव भवं प्रभुम् । BH(2-23-1).
The following names are thus derived from the facts stated above 
पार्वतीपतिः -  पर्वतः हिमवान् तस्य पुत्री पार्वती । तस्याः पतिः ।

Devi Gauri is called महा or great or glorious because of Her
greatness.
But one has to remember that She is dependant on Him for Her
greatness. Shiva's greatness is revealed by the fact that He married
Her though She was only the daughter of the mountain Himavan. This
marriage conferred greatness on Parvati and Himavan also. Similarly
as Vishnu He married LakShmi, the daughter of the ocean, and
conferred honour on LakShmi and the ocean also. This is stated
symbolically in our puranas.
For example, DakShayani wanted to attend and participate in the
sacrifice organised by Her father DakSha.  Shiva told Her not to go
and warned that if She disregarded His advice and went to the
function She will meet with humiliation. But She went to the function
overriding His advice only to be  met with a barrage of insults in
the assembly. Unable to bear the insult, She sacrificed Her body and
was reborn as Parvati. She had to perform severe penance to please
Shiva and married Him again.
A similar incidence is narrated in Ramayana also. Sita spent happy
days with Rama in the forest till She saw the the golden deer and
became infatuated with it. She sent Him away from Her to capture it.
This invited trouble for Her. The moment Rama turned His back on Her,
Ravana appeared on the scene and carried Her away to Lanka. She was
incarcerated for a long time and suffered greatly 
सिन्दूरदूरप्रचारम् - सिन्दूरम् = red lead दूर = distant,
far off प्रचारम् = going away. That is, Shiva's complexion is
very red and it outshines the colour of the red lead.
Shri Rudram says असौ यस्ताम्रो अरुण उत बभ्रुः सुमङ्गलः । 
This
says that Rudra is ताम्रः = copper coloured, अरुणः = rosy, 
बभ्रुः = golden yellow, सुमङ्गलः = highly auspicious and
beneficient. Only a few can understand and worship the avyakta or
impersonal God. A larger number can contemplate Rudra as residing on
Kailasa. For the benefit of the others, who form the majority of
mankind, He stands in the form of the sun. The sandhya vandana mantra
says सूर्य आत्मा जगतः तस्थुषश्च = the sun is the self of
the world, movable and immovable. The sun is the most acclaimed and
worshipped power of nature. It is said that असौ यस्ताम्रो इत्यनेन
आदित्यमुपतिष्टते । The votary should praise and worship the sun
by
means of the rik असौ यस्ताम्रो in the Rudram. So ताम्रः -
अत्यन्त-रक्तस्ताम्रः । ᳚नमस्ताम्राय चे᳚ ति श्रुतिः ॥


SS(572) is one of His names.
Also He is compassionate. The quality is represented by the red
colour. So His form is suffused with that colour. He is known as
दयाळुः - दयाशीलो दयाळुः । अनेन परमेश्वरस्य या शान्ता तनू
सर्वह्लादरूपिणी सा प्रदर्सिता । ᳚या ते रुद्र शिवा तनू᳚
रिति श्रुतिः SS(155)
सिन्धुराजातिधीरं- सिन्धुः = the sea, ocean राजन् = a king
or chief. It is used to qualify something very great or glorious. For
example Kalidasa describes the Himalaya as नगाधिराजः in his
Kumarasambhava.  अति = a prefix used to mean very, too,
exceedingly etc धीरं = strong minded, wise, resolute.
सिन्धुराज meaning the chief of the oceans : indicates a mighty
ocean. The Lord is very resolute, wise and strong minded like a
mighty ocean.
Kalidasa defines धीरः as one who is endowed with a mind that
does not waver even when assailed by deleterious forces that are
capable of  perverting it विकारहेतौ सति विक्रियन्ते येषां न
चेतांसे त एव धीराः ॥ (Kumarasambhava-1-59). Gita and the
upanishads use the word to mean a person of wisdom or discrimination.

देहिनोऽस्मिन्यता देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा । 
तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥ BG(2-13). 
Just as in this body the Self passes into childhood and youth and old
age, so
does He pass into another body. The wise man has no delusions in this
regard and so is not troubled in the mind. Arjuna had delusion in
this regard. He admitted in the end that his delusion had been
destroyed as a result of Krishna's teaching. He said 
नष्टो मोहः स्मृतिर्लब्धा त्वत्प्रसादान्मयाऽच्युत । 
BG(18-73). 
Again 
यं हि न व्यतयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ । 
समदुःखसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते ॥ BG(2-15). 
Here Krishna says a wise man who is not afflicted by pleasure and
pain is
fit for immortality. Such a man of wisdom is called as
धीरः and also as स्थितप्रज्ञः, स्थितधीः etc..

The upanishads use the word धीरः to indicate a man of wisdom
and realisation. This example is from Kathopanishad 
एको वशी सर्वभूतान्तरात्म एकं रूपं बहुधा यः करोति । 
तमात्मस्थं येऽनुपश्यन्ति धीराः तेषां सुखं शाश्वतं 
नेतरेषाम् ॥ KU(2-2-12). 
``The indwelling Lord of all beings; who is one without the
second and has everybody under His control; transforms His one and
single entity into multifarious; those wise persons who always
observe (meditate upon) that Lord abiding in self; (it is they who)
enjoy that eternal bliss; not the others.''
One other interpretation of the word is धीरः - धियं
ईरयति, धियं प्रेरयति । ईर = to urge, elevate, bring to
life. Thus the word धीरः means the Lord who is behind the
intellect and gives life to it. We worship Him through the Gayatri
mantra as धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् । Shiva is known as
गायत्रीवल्लभः - गायत्र्या वल्लभो
गायत्रीवल्लभः ।गायत्रीप्रतिपाद्य इत्यर्थः । SS(179).
The avaduta sage lists the similarities between a realised man and
the ocean in his conversation with the king Yadhu. The story is seen
in Shri Bhagavata.  He says: 
मुनिः प्रसन्नगम्भीरो दुर्विगाह्यो दुरत्ययः । 
अनन्तपारो ह्यक्षोभ्यः स्तिमितोद इवार्णवः ॥ 
समृद्धकामो हीनो वा नारायणपरो मुनिः । 
नोत्सर्पेत न शुष्येत सरिद्भिरिव सागरः ॥ BH(11-8-5 and 6).  
The conversation is narrated by Krishna in His advice to Uddhava.
The avaduta says: The sage should be placid and profound, difficult
to fathom and to cross over, illimitable and immovable, like the
ocean with its mass of waters at rest. And whether he has an
abundance of enjoyable things or he has none, the sage, who has set
his heart upon the Lord, neither overflows nor shrinks, like the
ocean on account of the waters of the rivers.
These verses say that a jnani's mind is clear. He is mature and
गंभीरः deep or profound. Describing the qualities of Rama,
Narada tells the sage Valmiki that Rama was profound like the
ocean समुद्र इव गांभीर्ये । (Balakanda-1-17).
The sage will appear to be simple, but his depth of knowledge and
maturity cannot be  measured:  दुर्विगाह्यः . Because of his immense
wisdom he cannot be overcome or overpowered. He is firm. He is beyond
time and space as he has found he is अनन्तः and अपारः । .
अपारः means shoreless. A jnani is limitless and all pervading as
he has found his true nature स्वरूपम् . He is unshakeable; this
refers to his emotional strength. On this point Krishna says 
दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः । 
वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते ॥ BG(2-56). 
His heart is not distressed in calamities. It does not long for
pleasures. He is free from attachment, fear and anger. He is called a
sage, a man of steady knowledge.
The sage is not disturbed by his experiences, be they favourable or
unfavourable. King ParikShit was such a person. He was born in the
royal family and brought up in the lap of luxury. He was said to be
calm and serene like Lord Shiva प्रसादे गिरिशोपमः । 
BH(1-12-23). But adversity hit him hard in the form of a curse. He
had only seven days left to live. But though he was initially upset,
he gathered his wits and immediately started thinking of what he
should do next. He renounced his kingdom, went to the banks of Ganga
and sought the advice of sages about what one in his condition should do.
The jnani has realised his fulness पूर्णत्वम् . So he has no wants.
His sensory experiences are like the rivers: they may bring in flood
waters or may dry up. But the ocean does not swell or shrink in size.
It retains its fullness. This is with reference to material
possessions also. So whether he owns all desirable possessions
समृद्धकामः or has none, he treats both situations like
नारायणपरः gifts from God. Ramayana gives a fine example in
Rama for this. He was to be made the king but this was not to be. He
was asked to go to the forest instead. But this sudden change of
fortune did not upset Him in the least. Valmiki says: 
न वनं गन्तुकामस्य त्यजतश्च वसुन्धराम् । 
सर्वलोकातिगस्येव लक्ष्यते चित्तविक्रिया ॥ (Ayodhya Kanda -19-33). 
No change of mood was perceived in him,-any more than in a (master)
yogi who surpasses all (common) men (because of his having risen
above all pairs of opposites),- even though he was ready to retire to
woods and was renouncing the sovereignty to the globe.
The man of wisdom does not become arrogant or depressed. Rama was said
to be like this सर्वदाभिगतः सद्भिः समुद्र इव सिन्धुभिः । 
Bala (1-16). He was always sought by the righteous even as the ocean
by the rivers. The commentators explain that just as the ocean
maintains its level even when rivers flow into it, Rama was
level-headed even though sadhus were regularly calling on HIm. He did
not become proud.
It emerges then, that in the case of a man of wisdom real possessions
are not material possessions and adversity is not poverty. Prosperity
for him is remembrance of the Lord and calamity is forgetting Him 
संपदो नैव संपदः विपदो नैव विपदः । 
विपद् विस्मरणं विष्णोः संपद् संस्मरणं हरेः ॥ 
It is possible that in adversity one's weakness shows up and all
thoughts of Lord recede into the background. But this does not happen
in the case of a true devotee. He is not daunted by reverses. In fact
Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas found from experience that
calamities made her think of Him and so she prayed that she should be
regularly visited by them! 
विपदः सन्तु नः शश्वत्तत्र तत्र जगद्गुरो । 
भवतो दर्शनं यत्स्यादपुनर्भवदर्शनम् ॥ BH(1-8-25). 
A jnani has realised his oneness with God. So there is no question of
his forgetting Him.
So, let us pray to the great Lord Margabandhu to show us the way.
भजे मार्गबन्धुम् ;- भजे = I worship मर्गबन्धुम् = the
Lord Margabandhu.

In this verse the poet uses four similies to glorify Shiva's generous
nature, His strength, His complexion and His wisdom. Talking about
figures of speech one has to note that they are used by poets to
highlight some quality or emphasise some thing. This works all right
with the things in the universe (i.e.) with finite things. But when
one tries to use similies while talking about God who is not finite
but infinite they fail. The desired effect cannot be produced. One
cannot find something equal to or greater than Him. Shri DikShita says
this in his poem Varadarajastavam 
यस्मिञ्जहात्यतिशयोक्तिरलंक्रितित्वं 
न्यूनोपमात्वमुपमा समुपैति सर्वा 
सूक्ष्मस्वभावकलनापि च न प्रतर्क्या 
तद्वर्णयामि भवतः कथमाभिरूप्यम् ॥ 
He says that one cannot describe His beauty directly, or by comparing
it with a like object or by exaggeration. Describing it directly is
not possible because His form is very subtle and cannot be grasped by
words. There being none equal to it, one cannot use a simile and
offer a comparison. Also one cannot use exaggeration to highlight His
form. For example Kalidasa says that King Dilipa was tall like a
tree साल प्रांसुः : Raghuvamsa (1-13). This makes nice reading
and sounds definitely better than saying that  Raghu was
exceptionally tall. But exaggeration will not work when talking about
His qualities as nothing can excel them.  Still poets resort to the
use of the figures of speech as with the worldly objects while
praising Him. This is done in their enthusiasm to sing His glory and
we accept it in the right spirit.

Meaning of the verse. I worship Lord Margabandhu who is more generous
than the divine Mandara tree, who is stronger than the Mandara
mountain, who is close to the great Gauri, who is of crimson colour
and who is more profound than the mighty ocean.

      ६. अप्पय्ययज्ज्वेन्द्र गीतं स्तोत्रराजं पठेद्यस्तु भक्त्या प्रयाणे
      तस्यार्थसिद्धिं विधत्ते मार्गमध्येऽभयं चाशुतोषो महेशः ।
      शंभो ...
अप्पय्य = the name of the author यज्वन् = performer of
sacrifices गीतं = sung स्तोत्रराजं great poem पठेत्
= reads यः = whoever भक्त्या = with devotion 
प्रयाणे = during a journey तस्य = for him.  अर्थ = wish,
desire सिद्धिः = fulfilment, complete attainment विधत्ते = arranges.
मध्यः = middle or central part मार्गमध्ये on
the way अभयं = freedom from fear, security आशु = fast,
quick तोषः = satisfaction, pleasure, delight.
आशुतोषः means one who is easily pleased महेशः = name
of Shiva.
This verse gives the benefit or the fruit of reciting the poem and is
known as फलश्रुतिः । फलं means the fruit, the result or the
reward. The author says that one who reads the poem with devotion
during a journey will be successful and attain his goal or wishes. In
addition he will feel secure and be protected by the Lord on the way.
What is the nature of the Lord? He is महेशः the Lord of the
lords like Indra and Brahma. It is to Him that they all rush when
they are confronted by fear or serious danger. This name was
explained in verse No. 4 where it occurs. But though He is the
supreme Lord a devotee can easily please Him by offering items that
can beobtained without difficulty. He is known by following names:  
सुलभः - पत्रपुष्पफलादिभि-र्भक्तिमात्रसमर्पितैः सुखेन
लभ्यत इति सुलभः । ᳚पत्रेषु पुष्पेषु तोयेषु 
अक्रीतलभ्येषु सदैव सत्सु । भक्त्येक-लभ्ये पुरुषे पुराणे
मुक्त्यै कथं न क्रियते प्रयत्नः ॥᳚ इति महाभारते ॥ 
VS(817). He is easily pleased by offering some leaves, flowers or
fruits. The lowly woman Sabari could please Lord Rama by offering Him
some fruits she had gathered in the forest. Krishna accepted with
great delight some pounded rice which the poor brahmin Kuchela
brought Him.
Shri Krishna says that His devotees can attain the highest results by
just offering a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water 
पत्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्त्या प्रयच्छति । तदहं
भक्त्युपहृत- मश्नामि प्रयतात्मनः ॥ BG(9-26)
Shiva is known as: करवीरप्रियः - करवीरप्रियत्वं शिवस्य
पुराणादिषु प्रसिद्धम् ।
᳚एकेन करवीरेण सितेनाप्यसितेन वा । हरिं हरं वा
संपूज्य ब्रह्मभूयाय कल्पते᳚ इति ।
अनेन शिवपूजस्यां सौलभ्यमुक्तम् । शिवः पूजनीय इति च ॥ 
SS(326).
भक्तानां सुलभः - शिवपूजादिपराणां सुलभः,
शीघ्रमनुग्राहकः । तदर्तमेव शिवमूर्तिग्रहणम् ॥ SS(484).
One of Shri Lalita's names also states this fact सुखाराध्या -
सुखेन उपवासादिरूपकायक्लेशं ध्येयस्वरूप- 
नियमननिर्बन्धादिकं चान्तरेणाप्याराध्या ॥ LS(680). Prahlada
says that it does not need much effort to please Him. One need not
strain himself and go on pilgrimages etc., in search of Him 
न ह्यच्युतं प्रीणयतओ बह्वायासोऽसुरात्मजाः । आत्मत्वात्
सर्वभूतानां सिद्धत्वादिह सर्वतः ॥ BH(6-6-19). He is the very
Self of every being and He is available everywhere.
There is an apocryphal story that once the author Shri DikShita was
preparing to go to a nearby village on some work  when he received
information that some people who were ill disposed to him were
hatching a diabolical plot to attack and kill him on the way. The
poet composed this stotram and prayed to the Lord to ensure his
safety during the journey. As a result the enemies could not carry
out their plan and Shri DikShita could complete his travel in complete
safety. We too can recite this stotram and be protected by the Lord
in our travels.
It is our tradition to mention the फलश्रुतिः or the fruits of
reciting or listening to stotras or puranas or other holy texts. This
is usually said in the end of the text but sometimes is mentioned in
the beginning of the  text or in both places. The purpose of the
फलश्रुतिः is to interest one in reading or listening to the
composition. The author in this case had lead a religious life. He
had  built two templesin his native village.He had performed
several sacrifices as is expected of a brahmin.  So he gets the
appellation dikShita appended to his name. He also states this fact
by calling himself as यज्वन् . The Manusmrithi states that
performing sacrifices is one of the duties of a brahmin 
अध्यापनमध्ययनं यजनं याजनं तथा । दानं प्रतिग्रहं
चैव ब्राह्मणानामकल्पयत् ॥ 
Kalidasa says that the kings of the solar dynasty tended the
sacrificial fires by means of offerings and honoured the guests also.
यथाविधि हुताग्नीनां यथाकामार्चितार्थिनाम् । (Raghuvamsa-1-6).
Manu further says that the noble ones should eat only the remains of
this yagna as only it is worth eating. One who cooks for himself eats
sin 
अघं स केवलं भुङ्क्ते यः पचत्यात्मकारणात् ।
यज्ञशिष्टाशनं ह्येतत्सतामन्नं विधीयते ॥ 
Krishna talks at length about various kinds of sacrifices in Gita (in
chapter IV). He eulogises the performance of sacrifices by saying
यज्ञशिष्टामृतभूजो यान्ति ब्रह्म सनातनम् । नायं
लोकोऽस्ययज्ञस्य कुतोऽन्यः कुरुसत्तम । 
Eating the ambrosia, the remnant of the sacrifice, they go to the
eternal brahman. Even this world, which is common to all beings is
not for one who does not perform the sacrifices mentioned. How can
there be to him another world which can be secured only by superior
means? (BG 4-31).
The Lord Himself is called yagna यज्ञः- सर्वयज्ञस्वरूपत्वाद्
यज्ञः;᳚यज्ञो वौ विष्णुः᳚ (तै-सं-१-७-४)
इति
श्रुतेः । VS(445). Also यज्ञः- सर्वयज्ञस्वरूपत्वाद्यज्ञः ।
᳚त्वं यज्ञस्त्वं विष्णु᳚रिति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(160).
The performance of prescribed duties or what is known as karmas is
necessary to get purification of the mind. This is thenecessary
first step in the path of spiritual progress चित्तस्य शुद्धये
कर्म says Shri Sankaracharya in his Vivekachudamani.
He defines such a person who has been regularly performing the
sacrifices as noble minded महात्मानः अक्षुद्रचित्ताः in his
commentary (BG-19-13). Anandagiri elaborates the definition as
महान् प्रकृष्टो यज्ञादिभिः शोधित आत्मा सत्वं येषां -
those whose minds have been purified by sacrifice etc.
Such a person who is sincere, performs the duties expected of him and
is broad minded is known as आप्तः - आप्तः यथार्तवक्ता । - a
credible, trustworthy person. Such persons speak from experience. So
we need not question their sincerity but accept what they say as the
truth with complete faith. Thus our tradition says आप्तवाक्यं
प्रमाणम् । 
Great men act and speak for the good of the world only. They have no
axes to grind.
King ParikShit mentions this point when he greets the great sages who
had come to see him in his last days 
समागताः सर्वत एव सर्वे वेदा यथा मूर्तिधरास्त्रिपृष्ठे ।
नेहाथवामुत्र च कश्चनार्थ ऋते परानुग्रहमात्मशीलम् ॥ 
The king said ``shining like the vedas you have all come together
from every quarter. You have no purpose of your own in this world (to
achieve) in this world or in the next, except doing good to others ,
which is your innate disposition.'' BH(1-19-23).
Shri Sankaracharya also talks about this trait of great men: 
शान्ता महान्तो निवसन्ति सन्तो वसन्तवल्लोकहितं चरन्तः । तीर्णाः
स्वयं भीमभवार्णवं जनानहेतुनान्यानपि तारयन्तः ॥ 
(Vivekachudamani).
There are good souls, calm and magnanimous, who do good to others as
does the spring, and who, having crossed this dreadful ocean of birth
and death, help others also to cross the same, without any motive
whatsoever 
गीतं = sung, chanted. The poet says that he had sung the poem.
Does it mean he had not composed it? For example, one of the
definitions of the word भगवद्गीता is that it was sung or
chanted by Krishna: श्रीमता  भगवता गीता . This implies that
He was not the author of the work (न कृता ) but was merely
repeating what had been said by someone else earlier.  Krishna
Himself told Arjuna that  He had imparted the same teaching long back
to the Sun (Vivasvat) at the commencement of evolution by Him. This
was then handed down in regular succession among the royal sages (men
who were at once kings and sages). Thus it was an ancient teaching.
The text may be different but the contents are essentially the same.
They can be found in the upanishads also. One of the Gita Dhyana
states this: 
सर्वोपनिषदो गावो, दोग्धा गोपालनन्दनः । पार्थो वत्सः,
सुधीर्भोक्ता, दुग्धं गीतामृतं महत् ॥ 
The upanishads are like the cows. Gopala is the one who milks them.
Partha (Arjuna) forms the calf. The pure minded one is the partaker
and the supreme nectar Gita is the milk.
In the same manner, in this case also the poet had glorified the Lord
by stringing together some of His attributes. These attributes are to
be found in the puranas etc., and so were known long back. Also the
fact that singing the glories of the Lord will confer great benefits
is also known from time immemorial. In the introduction to the Vishnu
Sahasranama Bhishma tells Yudhishtira:  
I willtell you some of the renowned names of the Lord culled from
various  sources (such as the vedas and puranas) by great sages.
These names will confer all merits 
यानि नामानि गौणानि विख्यातानि महात्मनः । ऋषिभिः परिगीतानि तानि
वक्ष्यामि भूतये ॥ 
Thus, the use of the word ``sung'' (गीतम्) seems
appropriate.
Why this piece is called स्तोत्र राजा a great or splendid piece of
work? In the beginning of Chapter 9 of Gita, Krishna talks of the
knowledge of brahman and to glorify the subject He calls it
राजविद्या राजगुह्यम् । ``the sovereign science, the sovereign
secret.''
It is called sovereign because it talks of brahman and not of any
lowly subject. It shows the way to wash off one's sins and attain
brahman. Similarly this stotra glorifies the Lord who is brahman, who
is limitless and thus supreme. It does not talk of some thing that is
inferior or perishable like a monarch or gods like Indra and Brahma
who are all in the clutches of time.
It says then पठेद्यस्तु भक्त्या प्रयाणे तस्य अर्थसिद्धिं
विधत्ते । (i.e.) whoever reads this with devotion during a journey,
the mission will be completed successfully. The emphasis is on the
word भक्त्या - with devotion. This implies that such great hymns
should not be read or chanted mechanically, by rote but with
devotion. One should put his heart and mind in it.  Bhishma says so
in theintroduction to Vishnu Sahasranama : ``Among the dharmas
prescribed the one I am going to say namely, worshipping the Lord by
singing His glories with devotion is, I consider the best.''
एष मे सर्वधर्माणां धर्मोऽधिकतमो मतः । यद्भक्त्या
पुण्डरीकाक्षं स्तवैरर्चेन्नरः सदा ॥ 
This is in reply to King Yudishtira's question to him  ``which
among the dharmas or duties you have mentioned is , according to you
the best?'' को धर्मः सर्वधर्माणां भवतः परमो
मतः? 
Bhakti (devotion) while chanting the names of the Lord is mentioned
more than once in the end after the stotram also. For example it is
said: भक्तिमान् यः सदोत्थाय शुचिस्तद्गतमानसः । सहस्रं
वासुदेवस्य नाम्नामेतत् प्रकीर्तयेत् ॥१२५।
इमं स्तवमधीयानः श्रद्धाभक्तिसमन्वितः ।
युज्येतात्मसुखक्षान्ति-श्रीधृतिस्मृतिकीर्तिभिः ॥१३२॥

Shri Sankaracharya , in his commentary, says: 
भक्तिमानित्यादिना भक्तिमतः शुचेः
सततमुद्युक्तस्यैकाग्रचित्तस्य श्रद्धालोर्विशिष्टाधिकारिणः
फलविशेषं दर्शयति । Thus a great deal of emphasis is laid
on devotion and faith. The Lord is  अनिमिषः । always awake
VS(215) and on the look-out for people who have devotion. He has
innumerable number of ears, eyes, mouths etc. सर्वतः
पाणिपादं तत् सर्वतोऽक्षिशिरोरुहम् । सर्वतः श्रुतिमाल्लोके
सर्वमावृत्य तिष्ठति ॥ SU(3-6). His (as Ganesa) ears are big
and very sensitive. With them He can hear even prayers muttered
softly. With His long proboscis He can detect even the faintest aroma
of piety. He loves sincere prayers offered by His devotees and
blesses them. He has the name: स्तवप्रियः VS(680). This does not
mean that He loves adulation. He has no need for it. It is we who
benefit by singing His glories.
It was said पठेद्यस्तु भक्त्या प्रयाणे तस्य अर्थसिद्धिं
विधत्ते मार्गमध्येऽभयंच आशुतोषो महेशः । 
(i.e.) whoever reads this with devotion during a journey, the Lord
will ensure that the mission is completed successfully. In addition
he will feel secure as he will be protected by the Lord on the way.
We noted that the word प्रयाणम् means departure,or journey. But
if we scratch a bit deeper we find that the word also means death or
departure from this world. This latter meaning puts the statement in
a different perspective and introduces a very important topic viz.,
the last moments of one's life and how it is to be managed.  Both
प्रयाणकालः and अन्तकालः mean the same thing. The
Bhagavatha Purana is very relevant in this context as it deals with
this subject elaborately. It presents case histories of the last
moments of many people to illustrate the theories that are stated in
it. This subject is introduced by Krishna at the end of chapter 7 of
Gita and dealt with in detail in the next chapter.  He says 
अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेबरम् । यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं
याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ॥ 
Who at the time of death, thinking of me alone, leaves the body and
goes forth, he reaches My being; there is no doubt in this. BG(8-5).
And;
यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेबरम् । तं तमेवैति
कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः । BG(8-6).
Thinking of whatever Being at the end a man leaves the body, Him
alone, O son of Kunti, he reaches by whom the thought of that Being
has been constantly dwelt upon. The word Being may mean any personal
God (इष्ट देवता) (like Shiva or Devi) other than Krishna or
any friend or relative or anything else (may be his house or bank
balance or even  his pet) that had been occupying the person's
thought. This is mentioned in the upanishad also.
कामान्यः कामयते मन्यमानः स कामभिर्जायते तत्र तत्र ।
पर्याप्तकामस्य कृतात्मनस्त्विहैव सर्वे प्रविलीयन्ते कामाः ॥ 
MU(3-2-2).
An example is to be found in the story of the sage Bharatha that is
familiar to all. This is told in the fifth book of Bhagavatham. The
great king ruled over the entire country. It is because of him that
the country has come to be known as Bharatam अजनाभं
नामैतद्वर्षं भारतमिति यत आरभ्य व्यपदिशन्ति 
BH(5-7-3). The king was  - महाभागवतः a great devotee of the
Lord.  After ruling the country for a long time he handed over the
kingdom to his sons and retired to the forest. There, in the forest,
he devoted his time in the worship of the Lord and derived great
satisfaction. But he developed an infatuation for a fawn. His mind
got diverted from the worship of the Lord. He was engrossed in
protecting and caressing the young deer. Even as he was spending his
time playing and protecting the deer the hour of death approached
him. He died looking on the deer intently.
तदानीमपि-पार्श्ववर्तिनं आत्मजमिवानुशोचन्तं अभिवीक्षमाणो
मृग एवाभिनिवेशितमना विसृज्य लोकमिमं सह मृगेण
कलेवरं मृतमनु न मृतजन्मानुस्मृतिः
इतरवन्-मृगशरीरमवाप । 
As a consequence he was reborn as a deer. BH(5-8-27).Shri Suka says in
anguish that Bharatha, a great devotee, instead of attaining the
supreme goal , died like other common people and was reborn.
A person with unfulfilled desires at the time of death gets the birth
suitable to the fulfilment of the desires. So to one who wants to
avoid rebirth Krishna says:  
तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च ।
मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयः ॥ BG(8-7)
Therefore at all times you meditate on Me and fight; with mind and
reason fixed on Me you shall doubtless come to Me alone. . Here
``fight'' means doing one's alloted duty.
This means that if one thinks of Him in his last moment he will
attain Him. ``Attaining'' means realising Him by knowing His
true nature. Krishna says this a bit later in clarification. He says
-- 
पुरुषः स परः पार्थ भक्त्यालभ्य-स्त्वनन्यया । BG(8-22).
That Purusha, O Arjuna! within Whom all beings dwell, by Whom all
this is pervaded, may be won by means of exclusive devotion. Shri
Sankaracharya in his explanation says that ``exclusive
devotion'' means exclusive devotion, characterised by jnana or
knowledge of the self. स भक्त्या लभ्यस्तु ज्ञानलक्षणया
अनन्यया आत्मविषयया । is to be noted. Why should
``devotion'' should be characterised by jnana? In answer he
refers to what was said earlier (in verse 7-17). The jnani is the
best devotee as he is exclusively devoted to Him तेषां ज्ञानी
नित्ययुक्त एकभक्तिर्विशिष्यते Of them (the four types of
devotees mentioned in verse No.16) all, the knower, ever steadfast
and exclusively devoted excels. Shri Sankaracharya says that the wise
man knows the truth and so is steadfast. He is exclsively devoted;
for none else is seen deserving of devotion.
Attaining Him means liberation from the repeated cycle of birth and
death. Bhishma mentions this fact as he lay dying on the bed of
arrows. Krishna was present by his side . He prepared to shed his
body at the auspicious time since he had the power to do so. He
praised Krishna for His kindness to be present by his side at the
crucial moments.  He says: 
भक्त्याऽऽवेश्य मनो यस्मिन् वाचा यन्नाम कीर्तयन् । त्यजन्
कलेवरं योगी मुच्यते कामकर्मभिः ॥ BH(1-9-23).
A yogi who casts off his body with his thought fixed on Him through
devotion and chanting His name with his tongue is rid of all
hankerings and released from the bondage of actions.
Then Bhishma stopped the wanderings of his senses and praised the
Lord 
निवृत्त्सर्वेन्द्रियवृत्तिविभ्रमस्तुष्टाव जन्यं
विसृजन्जनार्दनम् । BH(1-9-31).
The first verse he said in praise of the Lord shows that he had shed
his attachments and he was surrendering his pure mind to Him 
इति मतिरुपकल्पिता वितृष्णा भगवति सात्वतपुङ्गवे विभूम्नि ।
स्वसुखमुपगते क्वचिद् विहर्तुं प्रकृतिमुपेयुषि यद्
भवप्रवाहः ॥ BH(1-9-32).
He said that on the eve of his departure from this world he offers
his mind which is free from all thirst for worldly enjoyment to the
Supreme Lord. He begins by saying इति - ``thus or in this
manner.'' ``In this manner'' means ``in the manner as
advised by You.'' Has not Krishna promised earlier that: ''
with mind and reason fixed on Me you shall doubtless come to Me
alone?''  मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धि-र्मामेवैष्यस्यंशयः ॥ 
Thus Bhishma said that he was offering his mind that was free from
all hankerings to Him and was thus qualified for liberation.
Now, because such attainment of the Lord is the ultimate goal one can
desire, saints pray to Him to bless them with His thoughts in their
last moments. Thus Lilasuka prayed: 
व्यत्यस्तपाद-मवतंसित-बर्हिबर्हं,
साचीकृतानन-निवेशित-वेणुरन्ध्रम् ।
तेजः परं परमकारुणिकं पुरस्तात्,  प्राणप्रयाण-समये मम
सन्निधत्ताम् ॥ 
He prays that he should be blessed with the vision of his favourite
God Krishna that is at once bewitching and radiant, and a picture of
kindness, standing with His legs crossed,  decorated with a peacock
feather tucked in His hair, playing the flute with His slightly
inclined head,in his dying moments.
Now, Krishna says that by thinking of Him in one's last moments one
can escape death and get relief. So can one be ``smart'' and
think of Him only in his last moments but after leading a wayward or
a ``busy'' life that had left him no time to think of the
world to come?
``No,'' say our scriptures and saints. The reason is that the
last moments can be very traumatic for a variety of reasons. As one
grows old and infirm his will power becomes steadily weaker. His
subconscious is saturated with numerous thoughts. These thoughts will
take over and his free will will not be able to function. If a person
had laboured hard  chasing ``success'' in life, accumulating
wealth and all the appurtenances that go with it then he would have
developed strong bonds with all of them. The thought of having to
leave all those hard earned possessions behind will  be hovering in
his mind and be very painful. Thus he will die thinking of his money
and perhaps worrying how all that is going to be managed in his
abscence. Or one may be very attached to his family members. The
thought that he will soon be whisked away from them can be very
excruciating and occupy his mind at that critical moment. Or it is
possible that one may live long but may be overcome by debility and
sickness in the old age. The suffering can be so intense that any
other thought is rendered impossible.
Further no one can predict precisely when  the end will come. So it
is not possible to plan and work on thinking of the Lord  in the last
moments.
Thus, there can be many reasons for not being able to think of Him.
So one should practise thinking of Him right from young age and at
all the time possible. In this way the mind, slowly but steadily,
gets saturated with the thought of God. Then there is a good chance
of the thought surfacing at the right time. The words अन्तकाले च
 literally mean ``in the final moments also.'' The
``also'' means, not only the final moments, but also the time
preceding the  crucial moments - ``all through the life'' as
then only one can expect to be blessed with the thought of the Lord.
The devotee Kulasekara prays 
कृष्ण त्वदीय-पद-पङ्कजपञ्जरान्तः, अद्यैव मे विशतु
मानस-राजहंसः ।
प्राणप्रयाणसमये कफ-वात-पित्तैः, कण्ठावरोधनविधौ
स्मरणं कुतस्ते ॥ 
He prays to Krishna that his mind should now itself surrender to Him.
He asks how it will be possible to think of Him in the final moments
when the throat will be choked with phlegm etc. and consequently
there will be acute suffering. The celebrated vaishnavite saint
Periazhwar makes a similar request. He says that the last moments
will be painful. His physical strength will be depleted. His
faculties will not be functioning properly. In such a situation he
will not be able to think of Him. Because of these reasons he says
that he is surrendering to the Lord now itself when the body has
strength and mind is functioning properly.
Then what happens to the atheist who keeps himself busy earning for
himself, his family  with no thought of the hereafter and perhaps
leads a sybaritic life? It is a sad situation, say our scriptures.
Lord Kapila in His advice to His mother Devahuti gives a graphical,
albeit terrifying picture of the last moments of such a person. He
says: 
वायुनोत्क्रमतोत्तारः कफसंरुद्धनाडिकः । कासश्वासकृतायासः
कण्ठे घुर्घुरायते ॥ 
(At the approach of death) his eye-balls are shot out by the action
of the life-breath trying to find an exit: his wind-pipe gets choked
with phlegm, coughing and breathing cause him exertion and
death-rattle is heard from his throat.
शयानः परिशोचद्भिः परिवीतः स्वबन्धुभिः ।
वाच्यमानोऽपि न ब्रूते कालपाशवशं गतः ॥ 
Lying (in his bed) surrounded by his sorrowing relations and caught
in the noose of Death, he cannot utter a word even when addressed.
एवं कुटुम्बभरणे व्यापृतत्माजितेन्द्रियः । म्रियते रुदतां
स्वनामुरुवेदनयास्तधीः ॥ 
Thus a man of uncontrolled senses, who is absorbed exclusively in
worldly concerns, dies with a mind afflicted and stupified, and with
his relatives standing by, crying with grief.
Further it is said that in the case of such person the memory of the
present life slowly fades. The प्रारब्धम् pertaining to the next
birth is ready to take over and the person gets a vision of the next
birth to come. In addition, Sage Kapila says that, the person will
also have a vision of the messengers of Death who have come to lead
him away from this world.
यमदूतौ तदा प्राप्तौ भीमौ सरभसेक्षणौ । स दृष्ट्वा
त्रस्तहृदयः शकृन्मूत्रं विमुञ्चति ॥ 
He then sees before him two emissories of Yama, huge in size and
menacing with their terriffic eyes. The sight makes him shudder and
evacuate in fear. BH(3-30. 16 to 19). Kapila says further:  
एवं कुटुम्बं बिभ्राण उदरम्बर एव वा । विसृज्येहोभयं
प्रेत्य भुङ्क्ते तत्फलमीदृशम् ॥ 
Thus a man who lives his life entirely for the pleasure of his body
and for the support of his family is wrenched away from both and
subjected to the sufferings of purgatory. BH(3-30-30).
एकः प्रपद्यते ध्वान्तं हित्वेदं स्वकलेवरम् ।
कुशलेतरपाथेयो भूतद्रोहेण यद् भृतम् ॥ 
The body which a man has nourished by exploiting and inflicting
cruelty on other creatures, he will have to abandon here and go alone
to hell with the wages of his sins as his sole asset. BH(3-30-31).
केवलेन ह्यधर्मेण कुटुम्बभरणोत्सुकः । याति
जीवोऽन्धतामिश्रं चरमं पदम् ॥ 
A man who lives in this world merely for supporting himself and his
family by thoroughly unrighteous means will certainly reach
Andhatamisra, the hell of utter darkness. BH(3-30-33).
अधस्तान्नरलोकस्य यावतीर्यातनाधयः । क्रमशः समनुक्रम्य
पुनरत्राव्रजेच्छुचिः ॥ 
Then attaining again to this world, he passes through various animal
bodies one after another as part of his punishment until, having paid
for his sins, he is purified. He is then born again as a man.
BH(3-30-34).
Now, let us hear the same thing from the horse's mouth.Yama the god
of death told the boy Nachiketa:  
न साम्परायः प्रतिभाति बालं, प्रमाद्यन्तं वित्तमोहेन
मूढम् ।
अयं लोको नास्ति पर इति मानी, पुनः पुनर्वशमापद्यते मे ॥ 
KU(1-2-6).
Hypnotised by the attraction of wealth he fails to take notice of the
other world. For him the visible world is everything.and there is
nothing like the other world (heaven or hell). Such a person comes
within my clutches again and again.
Having gone through the above material about the ``last
moments''  let us seek the answers to the following questions:  
1- why does one fear death?
2- when do the ``last moments'' begin?
3- how shoud one prepare himself for the ``last moments?'' and
4- how much time the preparations will require?

We will try to answer the questions here.
1- why does one fear death?
One can be expected to fear or abhor or shun some experience if he
had had previously tasted it and found it unpleasant or painful. But
death can not be such an event. One could not have experienced death
earlier in this very life and carry on the experience of it in the
same life. We find that even insects try to avoid death. Because of
this reason our scriptures say that this fear is inherited from
previous births. The sage Patanjali mentions this in his Yogasutras
and calls the fear  अभिनिवेशः । He says that the fear affects
the wise people also.
स्वरसवाही विदुषोऽपि तथारूढोऽभिनिवेशः । साधनपादः-९। 
स्वस्य रसेन संस्कारेणैव वहतीति स्वरसवाही ।
अपिशब्दसमुच्चितमविद्वांसं तथेति तच्छब्दः
परामृशति ।
रूढः प्रसिद्धः । तथाच यथाऽविदुषः तथा विदुषोऽपि
स्वरसवाहित्वहेतुना यज्जातीयः यत्क्लेशो भयाख्यः
प्रसिद्धोऽस्ति सोऽभिनिवेश इत्यर्थः । विदुषामपि
मरणत्रासकृतं भयमस्तीति भाष्यकृतोक्तम् ।
पूर्वपूर्वजन्मसु
मरणकाले यत्रासो जातो ᳚मा न भूवं भूयासम्᳚
इत्युत्कण्ठारूपो भयनामा तज्जनित-संस्करमात्रा-
दविदुषामिवा- त्मविदामपि स जायते, न तत्राविद्यादिकं
कारणमिति । 
2- When do the ``last moments'' begin?
Suppose a person plans to go on a long trip, say, to Kasi  and he had
never been there earlier. One can easily imagine the excitement that
wells up in his mind. He will start running around, gathering all the
information about the place. He will start looking for people who can
provide the information, the train fare and numerous other details.
All these activities will be occupying his mind constantly as there
will be some  associated tension also. He  may be physically present
in his home town but his mind has already gone to the other place. So
we may say that the journey begins the moment it is conceived of. The
actual travel is also there and will follow. Similarly our journey
begins the moment we start thinking of the other world.The pilgrimage
to Kasi may come through or not: but this journey we are talking
about has to be undertaken by everyone. The details are plunged in
mystery. So it is incumbent on everyone to start knowing the complete
details about the travel and making the preparations. All these are
to be done now and without delaying it any further.
It is said that death takes birth along with our birth. BH(10-1-38).
Vasudeva points this out to Kamsa.
मृत्युः जन्मवतां वीर देहेन सह जायते । अद्य वा अब्धशतान्ते
वा मृत्युर्वै प्राणिनां ध्रुवम् ॥ 
From that moment it never leaves us even for a moment. Rama says this
to Bharata when the latter meets him in Chitrakoota. Bharata is
inconsolable at all the tragic events that had happened in his
abscence. His father had died leaving his three mothers widowed,
Ayodhya was plunged in grief and to cap it all his dear brother Rama
had been expelled from the kingdom. Rama consoles him and points out
that death is inevitable. There is no use in grieving over the dead
as every one is inexorably moving towards his own end. So Rama
advises him to stop crying over the king who is gone and instead to
grieve for himself.
अहो रात्राणि गच्छन्ति सर्वेषां प्राणिनामिह । आयूंषि
क्षपयन्त्याशु ग्रीष्मे जलमिवांशवः ॥ 
Passing days and nights quickly end the life-span of all living
beings in this world, (even) as sunbeams suck up the water in summer.
आत्मानमनुशोच त्वं किमन्यमनुशोचसि । आयुस्तु हीयते यस्य
स्थितस्यास्य गतस्य च ॥ 
Grieve for yourself (alone), why do you grieve for another? In fact,
the life-span of each and every creature, whether staying (at home)
or departed (for another place), gets shortened (every moment).
सहैव मृत्युर्व्रजति सह मृत्युर्निषीदति । गत्वा
सुदीर्घमध्वानं सह मृत्युर्निवर्तते ॥ 
Death ever walks with us (when we are walking) and remains seated
with us (while we are sitting). (Nay,) having travelled a very long
distance (with us) death returns with us (on our return). (Ayodhya
Kanda -105-20, 21 and 22).
Thus, one has to be alive to the fact that death is shadowing us.
Because of this reason there has to be a sense of urgency and every
moment has to be considered as the last moment. This is where the
glory of Shrimad Bhagavatham becomes evident. If Ramayana teaches us
the art of living then Shrimad Bhagavatham becomes an excellent
treatise on the art of dying. This is because this purana gives in
detail the answer to the third question:  
3- How shoud one prepare himself for the ``last moments?''
This is one of the two questions asked by the king ParikShit to the
sage Suka as the king is left with just a week to live. He asks:  
अतः पृच्छामि संसिद्धिं योगिनां परमं गुरुम् । पुरुषस्येह
यत् कार्यं म्रियमाणस्य सर्वथा ॥ 
``I enquire of you, the greatest preceptor of the Yogis, the
character and the means of the highest realisation. What should be
done under all circumstances by a man who is on the verge of
death?'' BH(1-12-37). The answer to the questions is given in the
Book II of  Bhagavatam and has been elaborated in the further Books
also. This is similar to what is said in chapter 8 of Gita.
We have seen that those who are soaked in samsara and lead a Bohemian
life get inferior births. Those who perform their duties and rituals
with desires सकाम कर्मा get births suitable for the fulfilment
of the desires.
Those who perform desireless karmas निष्काम कर्मा and also
upasana (which includes offering prayers, worship of the Lord in any
particular form etc.) form the next higher category. Krishna advises
that such people should, at the time of departure, cut off all
attachments. Then they should concentrate on the Lord in His cosmic
form as Virat Purusha or Viswarupa Iswara and leave the body. They
attain liberation in stages called क्रममुक्तिः ।
प्रयाण काले मनसाऽचलेन भक्त्या युक्तो योगबलेन चैव ।
भ्रुवोर्मध्ये प्राणमावेश्य सम्यक् स तं परं पुरुषामुपैति दिव्यम् ॥ BG(8-10) .
But a person of wisdom - jnani- who has realised his true nature does
not worry about death as it is meaningless to him. He is free and
liberated - मुक्तः ।  He is totally detached from the body..

The celebrated Tamil saint Pattinaththar presents this matter in his
own unique rather blunt way. The body by itself is inert only. It is
the presence of the consciousness in it that keeps it alive. Thus the
only difference between a living body and the dead one is the
presence of the animating life in the living body. And sooner or
later the living body will also become dead or a corpse. So the
saint, who was the personification of detachment, calls it as the
``will-soon-be-dead'' corpse! Or to put it in his language
one is a dead corpse and the other a ``will-soon-be-dead
corpse'' only. If one accepts this truth then one need not grieve
over death. This is a well known fact only, but comes as a rude
revelation. He is amused at the sight of a group of people
surrounding  a dead body and crying over it. He asks Lord Shiva at the
famous Kanchipuram temple ``O Lord! whence is this confusion;
some will-soon-be -dead corpses falling and crying over a
dead-corpse?'' A pregnant, though a very disturbing one,
statement that leaves us much to ponder.

4- How much time the preparations will require?
The ``preparation'' is for escaping death and it is
meaningful only for one for whom ``death'' has meaning. As
pointed out earlier ``death'' is irrelevant for a person who
has gained wisdom. ``One can escape death only by knowing Him.
There is no other way to escape death.'' So assert the shahtras.
तमेव विदित्वातिमृत्युमेति नान्यः पन्था विद्यतेऽयनाय ॥ 
SU(3-8). Thus the one who has gained wisdom is clear that death can
destroy only the body and not him. So he has no fear of death.
Yama-the Lord of death says this to the boy Nachiketa who sought
wisdom from him: 
अशरीरँ शरीरेषु अनवस्थेष्ववस्थितम् । महान्तं
विभुमात्मानं मत्वा धीरो न शोचति ॥ 
The wise person does not grieve. He knows that the all-pervading, the
greatest Supreme Self is present without body among all the
perishable bodies. KU(1-2-22).
Thus the preparation is relevant only to others who are in various
stages of spiritual progress. They have to gain wisdom first to be
able to reject death. This is illustrated by the story of Markandeya.
He was a devout worshipper of Lord Shiva. He knew death was imminent.
When the hour of death approached he embraced Shiva (who is the very
embodiment of knowledge)  implying he got wisdom and with the wisdom
rejected death and as a result he became immortal.

The question now becomes how long does it take to gain wisdom about
ourselves. Unfortunately Krishna says it is a very long process and
may involve many births 
बहूनां जन्मना-मन्ते ज्ञानवान् मां प्रपद्यते । वासुदेवः
सर्वमिति स महात्मा सुदुर्लभः ॥ BG(7-19).
At the end of many births, the man of wisdom comes to Me, (realising)
that Vasudeva is the all: he is the noble-souled, very hard to find.
Shri Sankaracharya explains in his commentary that these many births
are required to gain the mental maturity to make him fit enough to
acquire and assimilate the supreme wisdom that liberates him.
बहूनां जन्मनां ज्ञानर्थसंस्काराश्रयाणां
अन्ते समाप्तौ ज्ञानवान् प्राप्तपरिपाकज्ञानः मां वासुदेवं
प्रत्यगात्मानं प्रत्यक्षतः प्रपद्यते । He then realises the goal
to be reached is Vasudeva who is the inner self of all. Why such a
person is extremely rare to find? Krishna had said earlier:  
मनुष्याणां सहस्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये । यततामपि
सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वतः ॥ BG(7-3) .
Just one man among thousands strives to win the knowledge: among
those who know and strive, only one comes to know Me in truth.
What is the reason for this unfortunate situation? Why are people not
interested in the path of knowledge that assures them liberation?
The reasons can be many. One is that we have tenanted the body in
innumerable births and have become attached to it. The attachment is
so great that we have come to take the body to be ourselves. It
sounds preposterous to hear that we are not the body, but something
occupying it. It is naturally difficult, almost immpossible to shake
off the attachment that we have so assiduously nourished over such a
long time.
Secondly all the talk about the other world and liberation etc.,
sounds very theoretical. Things like heaven and God appear nebulous
and remote. What they are said to offer is not certain. So one tends
to prefer the bird in the hand and not the promised land.
We do not come across any who had been there and could narrate their
experiences. All that we hear about is only culled from various
books. Thus it is very difficult to get a lively interest in the
subject.
Then there are enough discussions on other mundane topics that can
veer us away from the subject. The influences of the media, the alien
religions, the many incidents that happen around us and some of our
own experiences add to the scepticism and help to slacken what little
interest one might have developed in the subject.
Then the preparatory steps that one is expected to go through to
become a qualified student for taking up the study of vedanta can be
daunting. They too can put off one from taking serious interest in
the subject. Because the steps known as साधन
चतुष्टयसंपत्तिः or the four fold qualifications include
things such as control of the mind to curb its wandering tendencies
so that it becomes focussed on a subject, control of the sense organs
so that they become disciplined, detachment to the pleasures of the
world.
Thus the reasons why people are not interested in the topic of
liberation can be many. One is busy during the active part of the
life. The general tendency is to put off religion  for the post
retirement period. But then it may be too late! Old age will bring
with it its own problems. So Shri Sankaracharya wails: 
बालस्तावत् क्रीडासक्तः तरुणस्तावत् तरुणीसक्तः ।
वृद्धस्तावच्चिन्तासक्तः परेब्रह्मणि कोऽपि न सक्तः ॥ 
So our scriptures advise one to start the practices early in life
before one gets sucked into the whirlpool of life. Prahlada tenders
this considered advice to his friends: कौमार आचरेत्प्राज्ञो
धर्मान् भागवतानिह । BH(7-6-1). When young the mind is fresh,
receptive to advices and is not yet polluted by the pulls and pushes
of the world. Kalidasa mentions that the kings of the solar dynasty,
about whom he writes in his great work Raghuvamsam, acquainted with
this subject even when young. He says शैशवेऽभ्यस्तविद्यानां 
(1-7). Our tradition says that only that learning that leads to
liberation can be called education.
सा विद्या या विमुक्तये । Shri Sankaracharya also defines education
as आत्मनो बोधः while commenting on the popular verse beginning
विद्या विनयसंपन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।  BG(5-18). It is
knowing about Self. Thus Devi (LakShmi, Lalita) is called Vidya
विद्या । The commentator's explanation is:  
मोक्षप्रदज्ञानस्वरूपत्वाद्विद्या । (Lalita Sahasranamam. No 549).
Other subjects are learnt only to eke out a living. They will not be
useful beyond a point of time. Thus they are inferior. So a wise
person will not fail to give utmost importance to this subject.This
is said in our upanishads 
द्वे विद्ये वेदितव्ये इति ह स्म यद्ब्रह्मविदो वदन्ति परा चैवापरा
च । तत्रापरा ऋग्वेदो यजुर्वेदः सामवेदोऽथर्ववेदः शिक्षा
कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं छन्दो ज्योतिषमिति । अथ परा यया
तदक्षरमधिगम्यते ॥ MU(1-4 and 5).
These mantras say that there are two Vidyas worth knowing to men -
Para and Apara. Out of these two; the vedas, and all their branches
through which one can gain the worldly and otherworldly enjoyments is
the inferior one and is called Apara Vidya. Para or the superior one
is that through which the imperishable brahman is known.
Yama also tells this to his student Nachiketa: 
श्रेयश्च प्रेयश्च मनुष्यमेतस्तौ संपरीत्य विविनक्ति
धीरः । KU(1-2-2). He says that two paths present themselves before
every one. One is called sreyas  i.e., the one that offers release
from all miseries for ever and the other is called preyas i.e., the
means of obtaining the pleasures of this world. The wise person
prefers the former viz., sreyas in comparison to preyas.
The Tamil saint Tiruvalluvar also points this out in his great work
Tirukkural. He asks what profit have those derived from learning if
it  does not lead to the worship of the Lord who is possessed of pure
knowledge?
But generally all these warnings and advices fall on deaf ears.
Consequently we have to take the long path for salvation. The story
of Gajendra, the elephant narrated in the eighth book of Bhagavata
illustrates this point. The elephant symbolises one covered with
ignorance. The elephant has a large family comprising of she
elephants and baby elephants - a typical samsari. He was
``enjoying'' the life. He was afflicted with the heat and
entered a lake full offragrant waters. The fragrant waters
represent the vAsanAs or the latent tendencies accumulated in
previous births. He enjoyed a refreshing bath, sprayed the cool
waters on the female elephants as well as their young ones and made
them also drink. This he did out of attachment to his own herd. Shri
Suka adds - like a householder यथागृही । Such a one steeped in
samsara normally does not imagine there can be trouble around the
corner. Thus the elephant could not foresee the imminent problem -
नाचष्ट कृच्छ्रं कृपणोऽजमायया । . A crocodile -
representing kala - caught hold of the elephant. The elephant
struggled hard to free himself but did not succeed. The gods looked
on the struggle without coming forward to help. The struggle went on
for thousands of years. This long time represents the numerous births
one wrapped in ignorance has to take. The elephant found that his
family members left him one by one . He was left alone, drained  of
energy and helpless. At this point the distraught animal cried to the
Lord for help. Indra, Brahma and similar gods did not respond as they
too are in the grip of time. The appearance of the Lord shows the
dawn of wisdom. He killed the crocodile  and released the elephant
meaning that with the gaining of wisdom one is released from samsara
or the cycle of birth and death.

Shri Suka gives another example of the king Khatwanga of the solar
dynasty. He was very powerful and on several occassions  had helped
the gods in their fights against the asuras. Once, after such a fight
the devas wanted to offer a favour in return for the help they have
received from the king. The only favour the king wanted was to know
the duration of life remaining. Much against their will the devas had
to inform him that he had only about an hour to left to live. The
king at once rushed back to earth, renounced every thing, meditated
on the Lord in that brief period of time and got liberation 
खड्वाङ्गो नाम राजर्षिः ज्ञात्वेयत्तामिहायुषाः । मुहूर्तात्
सर्वमुत्सृज्य गतवानभ्यं हरिम् ॥ BH(2-1-13). Most
appropriately Shri Suka calls the king राजर्षिः or royal sage, a
saint like king.
How can this be possible when Krishna had said that one can get
liberated only after repeated births? The answer lies in the fact
that
one has to take several births before coming to the path of devotion:  
but having stepped into the right path he will get births suitable
for his spiritual progress 
तत्र तं बुद्धि-संयोगं लभते पौर्वदेहिकम् । यतते च ततो
भूयः संसिद्धौ कुरुनन्दन ॥ BG(6-43).
Krishna says that in his new birth he gains touch with the knowledge
that was acquired in the former body. He strives with greater vigour
than that with which he strove before for perfection. Thus the
progress continues and does not stop till one gains wisdom mentioned
in our shastras. At that stage one's preparations are over. Thus the
king too was making progress. He got birth in the right
environment i.e., the solar dynasty. He got the right education even
as a child just like Kalidasa said of the kings of the solar dynasty
शैशवेऽभ्यस्तविद्यानाम् । The story of Khatwanga is told in
book nine of Bhagavatha. The king, on being informed of the short
span of life left did not panic or get agitated: but was smart enough
to take appropriate steps without delay.  He said that even as a
child he knew what was reality and was not attached to sense
pleasures offered by his vast kingdom. Thus, thanks to the right
education he had received in his early days he had wisdom. He could
renounce his kingdom etc., without hesitation and sit in meditation.
These characteristics were also  typical of the kings of solar
dynasty i.e., यथाकालप्रबोधिनां they were alert at all times
when vigilance was called for and then at the end (of their lives)
they abandoned their bodies by means of meditation 
योगेनान्ते तनुत्यजाम् . This is mentioned by Kalidasa in his
Raghuvamsam.
No wonder, then the king got the result he wanted in a short time.
Shri Suka gives the example of a great monarch to king ParikShit: not
that of an ordinary person or a sanyasi so that ParikShit will get
confidence that even a king like himself who had lived in the lap of
luxury could work and get liberated in a short time. But in his case
ParikShit had one full week to get freedom. So Shri Suka advises him
to shed fear first as there was ample time.
Then it was said that the one who reads the stotram with devotion
will feel secure as he will be protected by the Lord on the way.
मार्गमध्येऽभयंच आशुतोषो महेशः । 
It was stated earlier that our journey has already started and so we
are on the way. The question, now, is how can reading the stotram with
devotion confer security on the way? This becomes more relevant as
the upanishads say आनन्दं ब्रह्मणो विद्वान् । न बिभेति
कदाचनेति । the person having experienced the bliss of brahman
ever fears not. (TU-II-4-1) that only by realising the Self one can
shed his fears. We are long way from realising brahman. We very much
seek security.We have the constant fear that the things that we
consider as contributing to our security may get damaged or destroyed
or leave us. Thus we worry about sickness, loss of money, friends or
relatives etc.. The remedy for this feeling of insecurity is to
realise that all these listed above can not last for  ever. Either
they will leave us or we will have to leave them some day. Everyone
knows this but wants them to last for ever. Thus we want the body to
be youthful and last for ever. One is unwilling to grow old and end
one's days. Being insecure themselves nothing on the earth can confer
security.This is a fact and has to be accepted howsoever bitter this
may be. But strangely no one is prepared to accept this. Acceptance
requires wisdom and it is not got in a day. It is a difficult
process. The recital of the stotrams and other texts like the puranas
pave the way for gaining the knowledge. They describe the endearing
qualities of the Lord in a manner that will make our heart turn to
Him. Once He gains entry into our heart He clears the accumulated
sins and brings in the wisdom. Krishna has given this assurance in
Gita (10-10)
तेषां सतत-युक्तानां भजतां प्रीति-पूर्वकम् । ददामि
बुद्धि-योगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते ॥ 
``To these, ever devout, worshipping Me with love, I give that
devotion of knowledge by which they come to Me.'' Thus devotion
develops where even the seed of  it was absent earlier. This is the
power of listening to His glories 
यस्यां वै श्रूयमाणायां कृष्णे परमपूरुषे । भक्तिरुत्पद्यते
पुंसः शोकमोहभयापहा ॥ BH(1-7-7). Such devotion dispels
grief, infatuation and fear. Shri Suka lays stress on the fact that
this happens even one decides to listen to the Lord's stories
(श्रूयमाणायाम् ) leaving us to imagine what benefits it can confer
when one actually takes to listening to them.
Shri Vedanta Desika states this clearly in his poem Abhitistavam (5).
He says: 
भवन्तमिह यः स्वधीनियतचेतनाचेतनं
पनायति नमस्यति स्मरति वक्ति पर्येति वा ।
गुणं कमपि वेत्ति वा तव गुणेश गोपायितुः
कदाचन कुतश्चन क्वचन तस्य न स्याद्भयम् ॥ 
He says that one who praises the Lord or salutes Him or remembers Him
or recites hymns about Him or circumambulates Him or knows about at
least one of His attributes does not encounter fear of any kind at
any time from anyone at any place. This is repeatedly stated towards
the end of Vishnu Sahasranama stotram in the फलश्रुतिः . It is
said न भयं क्वचिदाप्नोति वीर्यं तेजश्च विन्दति and
भयान्मुच्येत भीतस्तु मुच्येतापन्न आपदः । and
जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिभयं नैवोपजायते । .
This was what happened to the king ParikShit when he listened to Shri
Bhagavatham. The experience totally transformed him. He shed the fear
of death, gained wisdom and got release.
God grants us the wisdom that removes the fear. So he is called
भयापहः - भयं संसारजं पुंसामपघ्नन् भयापहः । 
VS(935). But there may be fear from foes and elements etc. God
removes them also. Shiva is known as सहायः -
ब्रह्मादीनामप्यापत्काले रक्षक इत्यर्थाः । SS(762). He protects
even gods like Brahma in times of danger. Lalita is called
भयापहा - भयानि जलस्थलादिप्रयुक्तादीनि सर्वाण्यपहन्तीति
भयापहा । ᳚आनन्दं ब्रह्मणो विद्वान्न बिभेति
कुतश्चनेति᳚ श्रुतेः । तथा च वायुपुराणे ᳚अरण्ये
प्रान्तरे वापि जले वापि स्थलेऽपि वा । व्याघ्रकुम्भीरचोरेभ्यो
भयस्थाने विशेषतः । आधिष्वपि च सर्वेषु देवीनामानि
कीर्तये᳚दिति । 
We do not realise the fact that He is never away from us even for a
moment. We are used to looking out for security and not within. The
devout Pandavas knew that they could get His help readily whenever it
was needed. Kunti, the mother of Pandavas, acknowledged this fact
gratefully. She said: 
विषान्महाग्नेः पुरुषाददर्सादसत्सभाया वनवासकृच्छ्रतः ।
मृधे मृधेऽनेकमहारथास्त्रतो द्रौण्यस्त्रतश्चास्म
हरेऽभिरक्षिताः ॥ BH(1-8-24). She said that Krishna protected them
from poison, from a conflagration, from the look of man-eating
demons, from the assembly of evil people (Duryodhana and his
associates), from the many perils met during their stay in the
forest, from the missiles of many great warriors (like Bhishma, Drona
etc..) in every battle and lastly from the missile discharged by
Aswatthama (the son of Dronacharya).
The gopis also stated that Krishna saved them time and again from
death from poisonous water, demons in various disguises, showers,
storm and lightning and other perils 
विषजलाप्ययाद् व्यालराक्षसाद् वर्षमारुताद् वैद्युतानलात् ।
वृषमयात्मजाद् विश्वतोभयादृषभ ते वयं रक्षिता
मुहुः ॥ BH(10-31-3).
Thus the truly devout people never miss Him and are , therefore do
not feel insecure on the way. The ``way'' or मार्गः may
be viewed allegorically also. Our scriptures talk of many ways to
worship Him. These are meant for people with differing tastes based
on their temperaments. The Shiva-Mahimna Stotram says this: 
त्रयी सांख्यं योगः पशुपतिमतं वैष्णवमिति
प्रभिन्ने प्रस्थाने परमिदमदः पथ्यमिति च ।
रुचीनां वैचित्र्यादृजु-कुटिल-नानापथजुषां
नृणामेको गम्यस्त्वमसि पयसामर्णवमिव ॥ (7).
There are different paths (of realisation) as enjoined by the three
vedas, Samkhya, Yoga, Pasupatha doctrine and Vaishnava shastras.
People follow different paths and each considers some particular path
to be the proper one. This is because of the difference in their
temperaments. But ultimately they all reach You only just as the
rivers enter the ocean.
Krishna says that all paths of worship lead to Him only and It is He
who rewards them, just in the way they seek Him 
ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम् । मम
वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थस्सर्वशः ॥ BG(4-11).
Shri Rudram salutes  Lord Shiva who is in the form of various paths. It
says - पथीनां पतये नमः । पथीनां = शास्त्रोक्त
दक्षिणोत्तर- तृतीय-मार्गाणां पतिः । This says that Rudra is
the protector of the three paths described in the sastras. Later It
again says: नमः स्रुत्याय च पथ्याय च । salutation to Him
who is in the narrow foot paths and in the broad highways स्रुतिः
स्वल्पो देवलोकमार्गः, पन्था ब्रह्मलोकमार्गः । The narrow path
indicates tortuous religious beliefs and practices. Krishna talks
about this 
मूढग्राहेणात्मनो यत्पीड्य क्रियते तपः । परस्योत्सादनार्तं वा
तत्तामसमुदाहृतम् ॥ BG(17-19).
The penance which is performed obstinately, with self-torture, or for
the purpose of ruining another is declared to be Tamasic. The broad
and firm ways represent the beliefs and practices inculcated by the
great teachers. They are the safe ways and are intended to be trodden
by the common people महाजनानां येनगतः स पन्थाः says
Mahabharatha. Saint Thiagaraja talks about this in his famous song
``Sakkani raja margamu undaga.'' He asks ``when there is
the well-laid king's highway of devotion to God, why do foolish
people stray into hard, tortuous and thorny footpaths and
suffer?'' Saint Manickavachagar has stated the same idea in his
Tiruvachagam. He says ``I was straying in the company of fools
who did not know the path to liberation. The Lord pointed out to me
the path of devotion and how to shake myself free from my past acts.
He flushed out the impurities in my mind. He made me Shivam or the
auspicious one and ruled me with grace. Oh! who had received in full
measure the bounty God has showered on me? I mistook the wrong paths
to be the right ones. He prevented me from following the small
pathways and showed me the broad ones for obtaining His divine
grace.''
Again Shri Rudra says नम इरिण्याय च प्रपथ्याय च । 
Salutation to Him who abides in saline tracts and in trodden
pathways.
इरिण्याय   Irinyaya: signifies arid  tracts and has a refernce to
samsara.
प्रपथ्यः   बहुभिहि सेवितो मार्गः प्रपथः, तत्र भवः
प्रपथ्यः । ᳚नम इरिण्याय चप्रपथ्याय चे᳚ति
श्रुतिः 
SS(346). Prapathyaya: pathway trodden or resorted to by many.
The Lord helps all who seek Him by following various paths. He
says: 
मच्चितः सर्वदुर्गाणि मत्प्रसादात्तरिष्यसि । Fix your heart in
Me. You shall, by My grace, cross over all difficulties.
So let us latch on to Him and win His grace.
Thus we have come to the end of this gem of a poem. Quotations from
various sources have been given to stress the point that the Lord is
one but known by various names and forms. We can find that though
this is a small piece of work it condenses in itself the gist of
vedantic truth and is very suitable for regular recitation. I submit
this commentary of mine at the feet of my preceptor Shri Vedanta
Desikachariar Swami. He litererally flodded me with ideas on this
poem But my bird brain could retain only an iota of what he
communicated to me. I trust this work will receive the approval of
the readers. Namaste. Om Tat Sat.
