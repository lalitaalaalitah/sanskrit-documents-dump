चिदम्बरनटननं च

This hymn is by Sage Patanjali, the author and compiler of the famous
yogasUtra . Once upon a time, as the story of the origin of
the hymn goes, Nandi, Shiva's carrier would not allow Patanjali Muni to have
Darshan of the Lord Shiva (Nataraja of Chidambaram).  In order to reach Lord
Shiva, Patanjali, with his mastery over grammatical forms,
spontaneously composed this prayer in praise of the
Lord without using any extended (`dIrgham') syllable,
(without `charaNa' and `shRi~Nga' i.e . leg and horn) to tease Nandi.
Shiva was quickly pleased, gave Darshan to the  devotee, and danced to the
lilting tune of this song .
The place where this incidence is said to have happened is
Chidambaram (also known as Thillai), located about a  hundred miles
from Madras, Tamilnadu, India . It is considered to be  one of the
holiest places in India . In this temple, which has a gold covered roof,
Lord Nataraja is present in a cosmic-dancing form . Many books have been
written on the greatness of the temple and its deity and can also be inferred
from various hymns composed in praise of the Lord by the Shaiva
Siddhanta Saints.
Please refer to http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2583
for more information and detailed description of Shaiva Siddhanta.
The translation of the hymn is based on Smt . Usha Bhise's and is taken from
the book `caranasrngarahitam natarajastotram.' This book also contains a sanskrit
commentary on this stotra by Chandrakala . The book was published by Bharati
Samskrta Vidya Niketanam in 1992-

इति स्तवममुं भुजगपुङ्गव कृतं प्रतिदिनं पठति यः कृतमुखः
सदः प्रभुपद द्वितयदर्शनपदं सुललितं चरण श‍ृङ्ग रहितम् ।
सरःप्रभव सम्भव हरित्पति हरिप्रमुख दिव्यनुत शङ्करपदं
स गच्छति परं न तु जनुर्जलनिधिं परमदुःखजनकं दुरितदम् ॥ १०॥

the great serpent Shesha . One who learns it by heart and recites it will
find a seat in the assembly of Gods . The praise song is charming . The
words in it lead to the perception of the   the Lord's pair of feet.
It flows on, being beginningless and endless (composed of the meter
charaNashri.ngarahita). It contains the description of Shankara praised
by the divine beings headed by Brahmadeva, Lords of the Quarters and Vishnu.
One who recites this hymn,quickly reaches the highest goal and does not steep
into the ocean of worldly existence which causes great sorrow and sinfulness.
