Preface by Dr. M. Srinivasan

1. Ardhanareeswara

The Shiva-Lingam is a symbol of Lord Shiva. When you look at the
Lingam, your mind is at once elevated and you begin to think of
the Lord. The word Lingam is derived from the two Sanskrit words
laya (dissolution) and agaman (re-creation). Thus, shivalinga
symbolizes that entity in which the creation merges at the
time of dissolution and out of which the universe reappears
at the beginning of the new cycle of creation.

Thus, it is Shiva the destructive form of the Almighty, who
is represented by the Lingam or Mark, which is manifestly the
CREATIVE power of Divinity, the divine symbol that is utterly
sublime Light (Jyoti) in its philosophical underpinnings.

One of the 64 manifestations of Shiva - the man-woman
form with Parvati constituting the left half of Shiva is
Ardhanareeswara. This is a much-hailed form in scriptures of
various languages.

Mother Shakthi once propitiated Lord Shiva with such fervent
intensity that she be part of him in body and mind. Her pleased
husband through his divine powers granted her this wish. The
Master then absorbed her in half of himself and thus was created
the half-man half-woman aspect of Lord Shiva, symbolizing
the oneness of all beings. One can state that even In Gender
definition, this aspect became the fundamental root of Advaitha.

This fusion of Shiva and Shakthi representing the male
and female halves transcends the distinction between and
limitation of male and female and takes the Lord to the level
of beyond-gender manifest Brahman, realization of which means
liberation.

Shakthi part is golden, while Shiva part is snow-white. She
is substrate and He is substance. Shiva is static; Shakthi is
dynamic and creative. Shiva is Being and Shakthi is Becoming. He
is One; She is many; He is Infinite and She renders the Infinite
into finite; He is formless and She renders the Formless into
myriad forms; but both are one. Shiva and Shakthi exist in
Nirmala Turiya state (Stainless Purity).

When it comes to worship of Ardhanareeswara, some worship the
Shiva aspect and some worship the Shakthi aspect. Shiva is
viewed as the Holder of Power, though he is inert. Shiva is
Shava (dead body) without Shakthi. All that power in creation,
maintenance, and dissolution rests with Shakthi. But the Great
Mother does not exist without Shiva. When they become one,
Ardhanareeswara becomes, a being of generative and constructive
force.

Philosophically, this form portrays the boundless Grace of
God. The formless God is called parashiva. On Its own free-will
for the benefit of pashus (souls), which are drowned in pAsha
(bondage), It thinks to create the worlds. Its dynamism of
creation thus springs out of It, which is called Shakthi. Now
Shiva and Its power Shakthi create everything. This is
the form of their togetherness that makes every existence
active. Shiva and Shakthi are one and the same Supreme may
also act independently. They are associated like the person
and the action of the person. They are one and the same like
the ice and the water - one becomes the other. Poet Kalidasa
hails them as inseparable like the word and its meaning,
the letter and pronunciation!!

“vAk arthA viva samprakthau vAkartha pprathipathayae jagatha:  
pithrau vandhe parvathi parameshwarau “ From time immemorial
the man-woman relationship has always dominated the very fabric
of civilization. Whether it is the western theory of creation,
that of Adam and Eve, or the Indian concept of Purusha and
Prakriti, the very core of civilization stems from the concept
of the union of the male and the female.

Shiva and Shakthi are compared to gold and gold ornaments;
they are same; Shiva is hypostasis and when this force fuses
with Shakthi results in multitude of manifestations.

Legends:  
We find many references in our ancient puranas, regarding the
origin of this Supreme form. Brahma the creator of the universe,
crafted the cosmos as per the divine instruction. He made all
the living beings and yet could not find any development. The
beautiful world remained lifeless without any expansion. The
maker was very much worried. A heavenly voice instructed him to
commence creation with the help of copulative activities. But
Brahma was finding it impossible since all the forms had been
inert (males) till then. At this instance the supreme form of
Ardhanareeshwara manifested. Brahma contemplated on this form of
Shiva - Shakti. The Lord became very pleased with him revealed
his Ardhanari form- Left side of his body resembled like a
woman while the right side appeared like a man. Lord Brahma
worshipped this form of Shiva and the Lord then separated
the feminine part of his body and thus manifested mother
Shakti. Lord Brahma worshipped her and requested to bestow such
power by which he could create a woman. Goddess Shakti blessed
him by saying - 'So be it' and vanished. This way Lord Brahma
became capable of commencing copulative creation. It was only
then that Brahma realized his mistake and created a woman,
and Srishti or creation began.

In another episode, Goddess Umadevi once playfully closed the
eyes of her beloved, which plunged the world into darkness. All
living beings suffered in the dark. The universal mother felt
for her folly and separated herself from her companion. Mother
started worshipping Lord Shiva in the form of Linga to absolve
herself of this sin and to reunite with him. Lord Vishnu,
(or Adi Kesava Perumal, enshrined at Thiruchenkode, a unique
Ardhanareeshwara temple) instructed Shakthi on the Kedara
Gowri Vratam to be performed to unite with Shiva. When she
reached Kancheepuram, Lord Shiva ordered her to proceed to
Thiruvannamalai and do her penance. Likewise Mother Parvathi
did penance at Pavalakundru with the help of Saint Gowthama. A
demon called Makishasuran disturbed the penance of Mother
Parvathi. The Mother took the form of goddess Durga Devi
and destroyed him on the full moon day of the Tamil Month
of Karthigai during the auspicious period of pradosham. Lord
Shiva presented himself in the form of Fire atop the hill and
merged Goddess Parvathi on the left half of his body. This
day of Supreme merger is celebrated as Karthigai Deepam. To
commemorate this event, every year during the festival of
Annamalai Deepam, Lord Arthanareeswaramurthi presents himself
as Jyothi Swaroopa to his devotees.

Another famous anecdote of Ardhanareeshwra is related to Sage
Bringi. Sage Bringi was one of the ardent devotees of Lord
Shiva who considered that Shiva grace is the ultimate source
for existence. He was a violent votary of Lord Shiva to the
exclusion of any deity in the worship including Parvathi! He
refused to worship Shakthi, a woman. Even during his daily
worship, he would circumbulate only the Lord ignoring Mother
Shakthi, with a flashing spark of arrogance. The divine
couple wanted to enlighten the sage and hence assumed this
unique form sharing his body with Parvathi. The couple took
the form of Ardhanareeshwara and stood unified inseparable to
every atom. Even then the egoistic sage took the form of a
bee (Bringa in Sanskrit stands for Bee and the sage came to
be called Bhringi.) and tried to pierce through the body of
the Lord so that he could go around only the Shiva part. In
every human body the static force of Shiva constituted the
bone and the skin and the dynamic force of Shakthi triggered
the blood and flesh. Goddess Shakti, being the power as the
name indicates, pulled out her energy from Bringi's body. Now
he was a mere skeleton and was even unable to stand. The Lord
pacified Parvathi and gave the sage one more leg to stand. The
sage soon realized his folly and understood that life becomes
dynamic only by the blending of both grace and force which
are not contradictory but complementary to each other.

At this point, instead of getting deeper into the analysis of
the beliefs of different Schools on Saivism [one can read the
writings of Swami Tapasyananda, RK Mutt, for greater details],
going to the basics of Advaitic Philosophy of AdiSankara,
the following leads to Ardhanareeswara.

The Supreme Reality is non-dual, having within it, a
distinction between Shiva and Sakthi – the Power holder
and Power- described as Being and will. What is called Power
becomes the Mother, Tripurasundari and the Power Holder,
Shiva Her Concert. Thus though they are one in principal,
in practice they are treated as distinct. Thus it ca be said,
Shiva Lingam encompass both the aspects and become the Root
of Ardhanareeswara.

Ardhanareeshwara stands for a profound philosophic truth that
the female and the male are complementary to each other and
it is their combination, the blending of grace and force that
contributes to the creation of life.

The serene Kumudakriya raga and its flow in the kriti
Ardhanaareeswaram By Muthuswamy Deeshidar, provides the
appropriate background for a narration describing Tiruchengode
and the shrine to the Ardhanareeswara form of Shiva - a shrine
where the last puja of the night is of special significance.

This song by itself is easily understandable for its inner
meaning, - more specifically the charanam in praise of the
Lord. Many of te other songs By Muthuswamy Deeshidar at Various
Siva Temples on the Lord and Devi, though sound as if written
on Lord Siva or the Supreme Mother, a deeper understanding will
show that most of them bring out the Oneness Of the Supreme-
the Ardhanareeswara.

As examples the author would like to site only two songs:  
The song Thiagarajayogavaibhavam in AnandaBairavi

tatvaswarupa prakasam sakala tatva swaupa prakasam
sivasakthyaadi sakala tatva swarupa prakasam

the teacher of the nature of philosophical truth (tatvaswarupa
praksam), known by all the different religions (sakala
tatvaswarupa prakasam), and in the form of Siva and Sakthi
(potential energy and active power) which is the basis of
every thing.( sivasakthyaadi sakala tatva swarupa prakasam).

The 2nd song is the Neelayadakshi in Neelambari.

Siva Kaayaa Rohanee Sollasini Chitrupa Vilaasini

She delights in sharing half the form (“kaaya”)
withLord Shiva and shines (“rohane”) as
supremeconsciousness. (“sollasini”).

To summarize subtly for the understanding of the layman
about Shiva:  

He' Paarvathee Hrudhayavallaba Chandramoule' Boodhaathiba
Pramadhanaadha Girisavaasa He' Vaamadhe'va bhavarudhra
Pinaakapaane'

Samsaaradh:ukkaka Hanaath Jadheesa Raksha

The concept of the Hindu Trinity, establishing Brahma as the
creator, Vishnu as the preserver and Siva as the destroyer
was taught to the simple peasants by the Rishis.

Shiva is sometimes depicted as fiercefull god with terrifying
weapons and frightening face. In fact Shiva is not at all
firecefull or frightening and this fact can be understood while
we have an in-depth study of Vedas and Upanishads. Shiva
is very merciful and loving in nature. He always gives
his devotees whatever is asked for. He is the one who gave
immense powers to Ravana, Surapadma, Tharasura and many more
assuras. He is muscular while fighting with evils and that is
why he is called the Destroyer of evils. He is feminine while
gracing his devotees with love and that is why he is called
Thaummanavar. He is the male and He is the female. He is the
Shiva and he is the Sakthi. Without Shiva there is no Sakthi
and without Sakthi there is no Shiva. The Shivaskathi Concept
is enshrined in Ardanareeswar where we can see our mother in
the left and our father in the right. An iconographical and
textual depiction of Siva, which epitomizes this dynamic most
powerfully, is through the figure of Ardhanareeswara.

Ardhanareeswara´s iconographical embodiment of paradox
and the meeting of dualities-embodied sonically as well as
visually-mirrors a similar paradox and synthesis embodied by
individual men and women. The male hormone Testosterone in
women and the female hormone Estrogen in men testify to the
fact that characteristics of both sexes are present in each
one of us. The production of these in our bodies keeps our
personalities and our bodies in balance. The differences are
brought together in the beautifully conceived anthropomorphic
form of Ardhanareeswara. The form encompasses every thing
from action to inaction, eternal rest to endless activity,
the terrible and the benign. The Devi depicted on the left
half of the deity, is the power of god by which creation,
protection, and destruction of the universe is accomplished. The
philosophy of the Ardhanareeswara places the genders on equal
terms without question.

2. The Basics of the Yantra and the significance of Srichakra
and Maha Meru.  In Ardhanareeswara Puja.

Sri Yantra / Maha Meru is the mystical construction of
cosmos, and have the power of 330 million Mantra-Devatas
(subtle-energies) polarized and embedded therein, in the form
of 52 Matruka Aksharas (alphabets) which form the base of any
Mantra, its attributed Deity, the carriage (Vahana or vehicle
on which the Deity sits), the herb or tree to which it belongs
and the corresponding body part of the human beings, which it
controls. Therefore Sri Yantra / Maha Meru represents the whole
Universal Energy and the Energy embedded in every animate and
inanimate objects, meaning the Soul.

Before starting the worship it is advisable to know about the
way the Sri Yantra is constructed, what all it represents, about
the 9 Avaranas, the deities, their gunas and significance,
so that your worship is more meaningful. The following are
the authentic details as given in various Tantra and Mantra
scriptures.

Five downward pointing triangles representing Devi intersect
with four upward pointing triangles representing Shiva,
forming 43 triangles including the central triangle.

From the five Shakti triangles come creation and from the
four Shiva triangles come the dissolution. The union of five
Shaktis and four Fires causes the chakra of creation to evolve.

At the center of the Bindu of the Sri Yantra is Kamakala,
which has three Bindus. One is red, one is white and one is
mixed. The red Bindu is Kurukulla the Female form, the white
Bindu is Varahi the Male form, and the mixed Bindu is the
union of Shiva and Shakti - the individual as the potential
Sri Chakra. Varahi, the father-form, gives four dhatus to
the child and Kurukulla, the mother-form, gives five dhatus
to the child. Theses represent the nine dhatus of the human
body. Varahi's four fires are the 12 (4 x 3) sun Kalas, the 12
Zodiac constellations. Kurukulla's five triangles are the 15
(5 x 3) Kalas of the moon, 15 lunar Tithis.

These nine triangles also represent the nine stages of growth
of the human child in the womb. Surrounding the 43 triangles
formed by the intersection of the nine triangles are the 16
petals circle. Surrounding the 16 petal circle is an 8 petal
circle. After that the 3 lines and at the outermost part of
the Sriyantra there are 3 lines called the Bhupura.

The 43 triangles constitute the six inner sections called
Avaranas, the two circles of petals are two more avaranas and
the Bhupura of 3 lines is the last Avarana. These 9 Avaranas
of the Sri Yantra have various presiding Devis. They are the
Devi's Parivar (retinue) of total 108. In the Srichakra puja
they are systematically worshipped one by one with their
names and mantras. The presiding Deity of Srichakra, Devi,
is Known as Lalita Tripura Sundari. The form of Devi Kamakshi
of Kancheepuram is the closest resemblance of the Devi as
described in the scriptures

Chakra puja or Yantra puja is the worship of a deity in a
diagrammatic form. This type of worship exists in a lot of the
other parts of the world also. The worship of Devi in Sri Chakra
is regarded as the highest form of the Devi worship. Originally
Lord Shiva gave 64 Chakras and their Mantras to the world,
to attain various spiritual and material benefits. For his
consort Devi he gave the Sri Chakra and the highly coveted
and the most powerful Shodashakshari mantra, which is the
equivalent of all the other 64 put together.

The Bindu in the center of the Sri Chakra is the symbolic
representation of the cosmic spiritual union of Shiva and
Shakti. Apart from that the Sri Chakra also embodies countless
number of deities and represents the whole of creation. Hence by
worshipping the Devi in Sri Chakra one is actually worshipping
the highest ultimate force in the Tantrik form. That is, the
Upasaka is worshipping Sri Ardhanareeswara [ri] at the Bindu.

Lalita means The One Who Plays. All creation, manifestation
and dissolution is considered to be a play of Devi. Tri-Pura
means the three worlds and Sundari means beauty. She is
the transcendent beauty of the three worlds. Tripura also
signifies: - She is the ruler of the three gunas of Satva,
Rajas and Tamas; and Sun, moon and fire - the zodiac and the
planets, and therefore Time itself; She is also ᳚tripura᳚
as Will (Iccha), Knowledge (Jnana) and Action (Kriya). She is
also ᳚tripura᳚ as intellect, feelings and physical sensation;
and She is triple as the three states of the soul - awakening,
dreaming and -sleeping states. Her five triangles also represent
the Pancha Tatwas and the Pancha Bhootas. (This is what the
verse in Lalita Sahasranama means by -᳚Panchami pancha bhuteshi
pancha Sankhyopacharini ᳚. It is difficult to say what She is
not. Lalita holds five flowery arrows, noose, goad and bow. The
noose represents attachment, the goad represents repulsion,
the sugarcane bow represents the mind and the flowery arrows
are the five sense objects.

It is important to note that the Sri Yantra / Maha Meru is
placed, with the central triangle always pointing down or
towards the sadhaka (worshipper). In the Meru the central dot
is within a triangle and here also any point of the triangle
will always face the worshipper. Whatever side the central
triangle faces, it becomes south and the top becomes North. If
the Sri Yantra is placed with the 5 triangles looking down, it
becomes the Sakthi Chakra (potent energy) and if it is placed
with the 4 triangles looking down, it becomes the Shiva Chakra
(latent energy). In the case of Maha Meru, it is never placed
lying flat down, as it is conical and will always be placed
top up. Therefore they have no sides such as North, South,
East or West etc.

The north-east of the Sri Yantra / Maha Meru is the place
of Agni, the North West Divine (God), the South East - Asura
(Demon negative), and the South West Vayu air flow. Therefore
they totally control the flow of energy in the puja room or
meditation hall or house or office wherever it is placed and
brings in all benefits to the user. It corrects the aura
of the individual's magnetic field, cleanses the place of
unwanted energy, corrects vastu defects, increases happiness
and contentment and finally helps one to reach the goal of
human life. It ushers Spiritual and Material benefits to go
hand in hand.

The subtle energy in Sri Yantra / Maha Meru will not vibrate
unless it is properly charged and given the power by the process
of transmission of Divine Energy by the competent persons,
much like the human body, which cannot vibrate without the
soul. Extensive bathing with sanctified water, performing Puja
(worship) charging the Sri Yantra and Meru with Divine Mantras
prescribed, and finally doing Homa (havan) in sacrificial fire
are all done as prescribed perfectly.

Why a Meru inside a pyramid or cube? The angular measurements
of the Pyramid correspond to the angles in Sri Yantra /
Meru. The Pyramids give out bio-energy fields, akin to those
found in ancient Sri Yantra installed in various Temples
in India. Temples where the Sri Yantra / Meru is installed
provide the bio-energy to cure the illness of those who rested
there. Therefore a combination of Meru inside Pyramid/Cube was
conceived to double the effect of reducing illness, bringing
in harmony, prosperity and peace of mind.

Worshippers of SriChakra or Mahameru vibrate Divine energy
and are able to transmit the same to others for the welfare of
the society. There are nine chakras in the Sri Chakra. These
nine Chakras have each a distinct form and a distinct
name. Proceeding from the outermost to the inner, let us
describe the Chakras. The outermost is a square Chaturasra of
three lines, the lines one inside the other, opening out in
the middle of each side as four portals. This is known as the
Bhupura, the earth-stretch. This is the ground-plane if Sri
Chakra is considered as graded elevations, Meru. Through the
portals in the Bhupura one enters the precincts. Immediately
inside the square are three concentric circles, which serve
as three girdles trivalaya. The space between the sides of the
square and the circumference of the outermost circle, between
Bhupura and Trivalya, is known as Trailokya Mohana Chakra,
the Enchanter of the Triple World. Inside the 3 girdles are:  
1. Sarvasa Paripuraka Chakra - 16 Petals - Fulfiller of all
Desires; 2. Sarva Sanksobhana Chakra - 8 Petals - Agitator of
all; 3. Sarva Saubhagyadayaka Chakra - 14 Triangles [Chaturdasa
Kona] - Giver of all Auspiciousness; 4. Sarvartha Sadhaka Chakra
- 10 Triangles [Outer Dasara] – Accomplisher of all Purposes;
5. Sarva Raksakara Chakra - 10 Triangles [Inner Dasara] - Giver
of all Protection; 6. Sarva Rogahara Chakra - 8 Triangles [Ashta
Kona] - Remover of all Diseases; 7. Sarva Siddhiprada Chakra -
Inverted Primary Triangle - Giver of all accomplishments and
8. Sarvanandamaya Chakra - Bindu – Full of all Bliss.

The Mahamehru is consisting 43 triangles. The base is having
4 door opens which are called Dhwara Shris and the next step
is consisting 3 circles which are called as Bhoopurams and the
next is 16 petal lotus and the next is 8 petal lotus and the
dot is called as Bindustanam. In that Bindustanam, the goddess
Parasakthi is being seated in 4 legged simhasanam in the lap
of her husband Kameshwara. The puja method of this Mahamehru
is called as Navavarna puja.

According to ancient rishis and saktha upasakas where the
᳚Maha Meru᳚ is kept (i.e., Sri Nagara of Goddess Parasakthi)
it is sure that the three supermost powers namely Parasakthi
(to give us strength), Mahalakshmi (to give us a very good
wealth) and Maha Saraswathi (to bless us with vast knowledge
and education) will have their permanent residence.

As per the mathematical theory, Mahameru is of 90 Deg. and
its shadow will be only inside of it. In India, the Chola King
Rajaraja Cholan made the Sikaram in Sri Prahadeeshwarar temple
at Tanjore District according to this theory.

The mention of the geographic location of Mt. Sumeru in Vishnu
Purana is very interesting. Most significantly, Kailas Range
is situated at 31.00 N 82.00 E while Mt. Everest is at 28.05 N
86.58 E. Both the peaks are close to the centre of the earth
(90 degrees). Thousands of years ago, the maharshis could
realize that the Mount Sumeru is at the centre of the earth.

Bhaskararaya’s bhashyam for Lalitha Sahasranamam while dealing
with the Naama “Mahameru Nilaya” quotes that the Book,
Tantraraja Chapter 28.

“In the midst of Meru the great shining Lalitha ever
remains”, around it (the meru) there are 14 continents up
to the ocean where the other deities (remain).

Beyond them in the last supreme ether are, abodes of Chitra’s
and the other deities. Sri Chakra has 3 aspects: Bhoomi,
Kailasha and Meru. When it is identified with the eight deities
namely Vasini and others it is the Bhuprastara; when it is
with the matrika letters it is Kailasha; and the Meru when
it is with the 16-nitya deities. Meru nilaya means She abides
in the mental identification with 16 nitya deities. Meru, the
nine-syllable mantra as described in the gyanarnava indicated
by the following words:  

“ Bhoomi Chandra Shiva Maya Shakthi Krsnadhavan Madhana
Ardhachandra and Bindu.” Nilaya the place where from all
other mantras arose.

Mahameru Puja and its inner meaning.

The significance of Mahameru Puja has been well explained
by People like Anna Subramanya Iyer, Kalyanasundaram Iyer ,
Najan Publications and others. The following is the underlying
significance Of the Puja which must be a daily Ritual- for true
enlightenment. The person doing Puja it is said , is synonymous
with the Supreme mother and with true surrender and sincere
devotion to his duties , one integrates with the Ultimate.

One starts with Todi, then MahaGanapathi, Balasubramanya
followed by the 10songs and to does Lalitha Sahasranaamam and
or Trisadhi.

Here after singing Todi, the upasaka gets the blessings of Devi
to do The ULTIMATE PUJA and for that seeks and gets Permission
from HER and the 32 Rishi's/Sidhhas who are ever in Her Service
at the 1st step of Shri Mahameru.

Then he goes one step up on Mahameru Anticlockwise[ACW]
=Appradakshinam to get the blessings of MahaGanapathi[Gowlai
song] and 24 sidhhas,at the Banks of Kamalaalaya Theertham
.After having the bath the upasaka climbs 2 more steps, again
anticlockwise to get the blessings of Balasubramanya[suritti].

Balasubramanyar is Siva Guru and with him are 16 Rishis at
this step. Proceeding ACW while singing Ananda Bairavi,
asking MahaTripura Sundari to ᳚Protect me᳚: Kamalamba
Samrakshithoham᳚! One also gets to be blessed by 16 sidhhas
at this point.

According to writings by Greats, an average human is indeed
blessed very high to reach, even this step with all his/her
worries, aspirations and day to day responsibilities.

Now a blessed one proceeds further ACW singing Kalyani Kamalamba
seeking Her Grace to permit to worship HER ᳚as the one always
worshipped by Lakshmi and Saraswathi.” Here one is blessed
by Devi and 12 Sidhhas.

After Kalayani one climbs ACW to sing Sankarabaranam ᳚seeking
HER blessings to be integrated with ᳚Brahman᳚! 9 sidhhas bless
the upasaka at this step.

Climbing further ACW, while singing Kamboji, one is worshipping
Her as the ultimate Mother of all beings - Devaas, Rishis and
Lord Siva Himself. The upasaka is blessed to get Her Grace and
blessings of 6 of the Greatest Sidhhas and proceeds ACW to
Sing Bairavi. The meaning of Pallavi is explicit, “I HAVE
NOTHING ELSE TO CLING ONTO, except thy lotus feet-Param Nahi
Re᳚ telling her ᳚ Sivaantha Thathva Swaroopinya᳚= you are Siva
and Sakthi”. There are 4 more Sidhhas at this level..

Next ACW climb leads to Punnagavarali Song and Sahana
song, both in Her Honor telling Her, ᳚you are the root of
everything”. With Punnagavarali the upasaka gets blessed
by 2 SathGurus . At the penultimate step to Bindu [Kanda
Kamala]. the upasaka worships Lord Siva as the Ultimate Guru
of all. Now the upasaka is at the foot of Sri Bindu on Sri
Mahameru singing ᳚Sri Kamalamba Jayathi᳚. The lat song is
Sri Raga Kamala and one concludes with Lalitha Sahasranaamam
or Trisadhi or both. The Ardhanareeswara Trisadhi integrates
The Sakthi and Siva by way of Naamaas derived from Lalitha
Trisadhi and mostly Rudram and will certainly help the upasaka
for integration with the Supreme through True surrender.

3. What is special about Ardhanareeswara Trisati presented.

Ardhanareeswara Trisadhi is more a formulation than an Original
Composition.

The 1st part of each Naamaa is derived from Lalitha Trisadhi
and the 2nd part from Rudram. However of the 300 masculine
Naamaas, 34 are not derived from Rudram, but from various
other Scriptures set in praise of Lord Shiva since Rudra
Trisadhi has only Pranava Manthram or some repeats in these
34 places. These 34 namaas as well as the entire formulation
were made during Sri Mahameru Puja over several months through
the direct guidance by the Supreme Mother Herself.

4. Puja Methodology.

This is a note written with all humility and total Surrender
to Sri Ardhanareeswaraa for the benefit of those Uppsakas who
aspire for self-realization.

Sri Sri Paramacharya and the other Greats have always emphasized
on Athma Vichara while being selfless, living with no hatred
and jealousy towards fellow beings.

The Mother is an integral Part of Lord Shiva and no need to
look anywhere except Sri Lalitha Sahasra Naamam for getting
an introduction to Shiva-Sakthi Iykkyam.

People being familiar with Navaa Varna Puja, Mahameru and Sri
Chakra Puja are aware of the need of discipline and proper
initiation with rigorous Anushtana approaches.

In the present day world with a fast life, the average Gruhastha
has very little time for practicing even the elementary rituals.

This note is neither critical of the present day set up nor
aims at imposing any specific methodology for prayer.

It is said, that to be a Devi Upasaka, one should be blessed
by THE MOTHER even before the birth.

An extensive survey of Literature On Ardhanareeswara both by
Goggle and Wikipedia revealed that Lalitha Sahasranaamam is the
one cited for Ardhanareeswara Puja and this author could not
locate a separate Ardhanareeswara Trisadhi and Sahasranaamam.

This formulation presented here is at the ordainment of Sri
Lalitha Tripurasundari.

For those who may raise the question: Shiva Sakthi uses the
masculine Gender 1st while in this formulation on what basis,
Feminine gender precedes Shiva Naama in each?

In all our Puja’s during Sankalpam, we say: “Kalpakaamba
sametha Kapaaliswara Swami Sannidow, Alamelu Manga Sametha
Veenkateswra Swami Sannidow and so on.  Also Without Sakthi
[Energy] Shiva is Powerless. Naturally Sakthi take precedence
to Shiva, here in.

For those who have very high time demand on their daily routines
Natdopasana is adequate. Sing the songs of your favorite Deity
at least when you are taking bath getting ready for your long
Day. For those who have the time and drive Ardhanareeswara
Trisadhi Can be considered as a boon since one worships
Shiva-Sakthi through these 300 lines.

Abishekam with Rudram is the start of any Shiva- Sakthi
Puja. But without initiation, this is not done.

But one can do this Trisati after bath with Akshadai, Swarna
Pushpam

[Most Jeweler Shops provide Silver or gold-coated silver coins
for this purpose] or any flowers as per ones wish. One can do
it on any day of his or her choice if it is not possible on
a daily basis.

The upasaka must make sure that he or she does not make a
mistake and ensure that the gender ending is not overlooked. It
does not matter if one does it ONLY occasionally due to
time constraints, but do without mistakes. The author is
emphasizing this point since there are many whom this author has
encountered, who say, “I am doing the Puja with sincerity. If
there are mistakes, in methodology, pronunciation etc., let
the Deity take care”!

The author advocates the following approach to serious
upasakaas.

a. As a prelude to Ardhanareeswara Trisati Archana, one can
sing the Navaa Varna Keerthana of Sri Muthuswamy Deekshidar. The
Paddathi for singing is well established.

b. Those who have time can add the following songs: Saptha
Brahma mayee [Adi Sankara], Sadaa Saaranga [Manoranjani]
Annapoorne Visalakshi [Sama], Saraswathi, [Chaayaa Tharangini],
Amba Neelaayadakshi [Neelaambari], Akilandeswari [Dwijavanthi]
and Ardhanareeswaram [Kumudakriya].

There are hundreds of other Songs by the three Greats as well
as by Mahans like Papanasam Shivan and Contemporary composers.

Life is not a sweet bed of roses but any struggle in life can
be over come by Total surrender.

Though all slokas like Lalitha Sahasranaamam, Vishnu
Sahasranaamam etc end with Palasruthi, there is no need to read
this part if one accepts that the Supreme knows his aspirations
and the same will certainly will come to him/her. As long as
we are sincere to our duties- Parents, spouse and children,
we will never be let down and the Prayer will carry us to
heights we never would have imagined.

5. What are the essential qualities expected of the Upasakan
to achieve Self-realization and integration with the supreme.

A Sri Vidya Upasakan must not find fault with the beliefs
and faith of others and other religions. He must be sincere
and serious in his surrender and his worship goes on as an
undercurrent at all times. This comes naturally if he has Her
guidance. Never ask for favors but be prepared for service
and sacrifices. Be fearless and frank and do the duty and the
puja without looking forward to the fruit. The only goal that
he must have is self-realization.

Introduction by Dr. M. Srinivasan, composer of the trishati
Introduction

The Ardhanareeswara Trisadhi presented here is more a
formulation based on traditional principles and mostly derived
from Lalitha Trisati and Rudram. However some 34 namavali are
original reference to the Lord composed based on the inner
meaning attributed to the Lord by Greats like Jagad Guru Adi
Shankara and Muthuswamy Deeshidar’s Kritis.

The formulation was originally made as Siva-Sakthi Sadsathi and
presented as Offering at the Siva Vishnu Temple, Washington
DC on January 15, 2002 during Maker Vilakku Puja in the Lord
Iyappan Sannidhi.

It was then slowly integrated as Ardhanareeswara Trisadhi with
the incorporation of The 34 Namaas refered to in the 1st Para.

It is my duty to place on record my gratitude to Pujya Sri Sri
Paramarthananda Saraswaty for his time and useful suggestions
to improve the formulation.

It would have been impossible to bring it to the present form
but for the Editorial help and correction rendered by Sri
S. Srinivasan, Chairman and MD., SRA Systems (now discontinued).

The Tamil settings on PC was done by Rajamani Muthuswamy and
Sanskrit by Ganesh Srinivasan and Bharathi Ganesh. Their help
is appreciated.
