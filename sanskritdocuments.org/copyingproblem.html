<H2>Plagiarism of Sanskrit Documents<BR>
The Netiquette Problem</H2></CENTER>
<P width=80%>


We are encountering problem of copying of contents from sanskritdocuments.org
by owners of certain sites.
<P>
We have identified some who are routinely involved in practicing plagiarism and
copying texts from many places.
The files are taken without permission and with minimal mention of any
original source or without
courtesy references of people/sites who have worked hard to prepare them.
They are interested in promoting themselves, family, and/or ideologies
they represent.  They have
taken significant number of texts prepared lovingly by dedicated
and well-meaning volunteers.  

<P>The victims are the volunteers at
<a href=https://sanskritdocuments.org>sanskritdocuments.org</a>,
<a href=http://sanskritworld.in>sanskritworld.in</a>,
<a href=http://satsangdhara.net>satsangdhara</a>,
<a href=http://sanskrit.safire.com>sanskrit.safire.com</a>,
<a href=http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1275&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1>kamakotimandali.com</a>,
<a href=http://vedicreserve.mum.edu>vedic reserve</a>,
<a href=http://sanskrit.safire.com>sanskrit.safire.com</a>,
<a href=http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/>GRETIL</a>, Hindi Sahitya,
Muktabodha, and so among a few known.

<P>
This has certainly violated volunteer spirit at
sanskritdocuments site and have reduced volunteers' involvement considerably.
This is unfortunate situation that has been thrust upon us.
We are aware that 
a <a href=https://sanskritdocuments.org/sanskritfaq.html#SECTION0003500>note about copying question in FAQ</a>,
attempting to prevent a repeat of this sort,
is not going to make difference with the offenders 
who are bent on following their "ideology."
<!--When notified about the misuse, the responses we received from the 
offending site owners indicate affection for their own dharma, as
the subhAShita mentioning
 <a href=https://www.google.com/search?q=%E0%A4%9A%E0%A5%8C%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A3%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%83%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%82+%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8D+&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=sb>चौराणामनृतं बलम् ॥  
(chaurANAM anRitam balam).</a>-->

<P>
Upon considerable deliberation, at this time,
the Sanskrit Team members have decided
not to put up the names of the sites and owners that are profiting from the work
done by volunteers. 
We believe that the bitterness caused by public humiliation
is not going to further the cause
of promoting Sanskrit literature study, related knowledge, and associated devotion.
<b><center>Hope to maintain due respect for volunteer spirit!</center></b>
