<HR>

The text is from Srimad BhAgavatam, Skandha 10 ,Ch 87, verses 14-41.
The meanings are extracted from http://home.att.net/~gitaprasad/BhPurantm

14. The srutis said: Victory, victory to You, O unconquerable one! By
Your very nature You are perfectly full in all opulences; therefore
please defeat the eternal power of illusion, who assumes control over
the modes of nature to create difficulties for conditioned souls. O You
who awaken all the energies of the moving and nonmoving embodied beings,
sometimes the Vedas can recognize You as You sport with Your material
and spiritual potencies.

15. This perceivable world is identified with the Supreme because
the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate foundation of all existence,
remaining unchanged as all created things are generated from it and at
last dissolved into it, just as clay remains unchanged by the products
made from it and again merged with it. Thus it is toward You alone that
the Vedic sages direct all their thoughts, words and acts. After all,
how can the footsteps of men fail to touch the earth on which they live?

16. Therefore, O master of the three worlds, the wise get rid of all
misery by diving deep into the nectarean ocean of topics about You, which
washes away all the contamination of the universe. Then what to speak of
those who, having by spiritual strength rid their minds of bad habits
and freed themselves from time, are able to worship Your true nature,
O supreme one, finding within it uninterrupted bliss?

17. Only if they become Your faithful followers are those who breathe
actually alive, otherwise their breathing is like that of a bellows. It
is by Your mercy alone that the elements, beginning with the mahat-tattva
and false ego, created the egg of this universe. Among the manifestations
known as anna-maya and so forth, You are the ultimate one, entering
within the material coverings along with the living entity and assuming
the same forms as those he takes. Distinct from the gross and subtle
material manifestations, You are the reality underlying them all.

18. Among the followers of the methods set forth by great sages, those
with less refined vision worship the Supreme as present in the region of
the abdomen, while the Arunis worship Him as present in the heart, in the
subtle center from which all the pranic channels emanate. From there,
O unlimited Lord, these worshipers raise their consciousness upward
to the top of the head, where they can perceive You directly. Then,
passing through the top of the head toward the supreme destination, they
reach that place from which they will never again fall to this world,
into the mouth of death.

19. Apparently entering among the variegated species of living beings
You have created, You inspire them to act, manifesting Yourself according
to their higher and lower positions, just as fire manifests differently
according to the shape of what it burns. Therefore those of spotless
intelligence, who are altogether free from material attachments, realize
Your undifferentiated, unchanging Self to be the permanent reality among
all these impermanent life forms.

20. The individual living entity, while inhabiting the material bodies he
has created for himself by his karma, actually remains uncovered by either
gross or subtle matter. This is so because, as the Vedas describe, he is
part and parcel of You, the possessor of all potencies. Having determined
this to be the status of the living entity, learned sages become imbued
with faith and worship Your lotus feet, to which all Vedic sacrifices
in this world are offered, and which are the source of liberation.

21. My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue
of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastimes,
which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the
unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to
liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their
association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the
lotus of Your feet.

22. When this human body is used for Your devotional service, it acts as
one’s self, friend and beloved. But unfortunately, although You always
show mercy to the conditioned souls and affectionately help them in
every way, and although You are their true Self, people in general fail
to delight in You. Instead they commit spiritual suicide by worshiping
illusion. Alas, because they persistently hope for success in their
devotion to the unreal, they continue to wander about this greatly
fearful world, assuming various degraded bodies.

23. Simply by constantly thinking of Him, the enemies of the Lord attained
the same Supreme Truth whom sages fixed in yoga worship by controlling
their breath, mind and senses. Similarly, we srutis, who generally see
You as all-pervading, will achieve the same nectar from Your lotus feet
that Your consorts are able to relish because of their loving attraction
to Your mighty, serpentine arms, for You look upon us and Your consorts
in the same way.

24. Everyone in this world has recently been born and will soon die. So
how can anyone here know Him who existed prior to everything else and who
gave rise to the first learned sage, Brahma, and all subsequent demigods,
both lesser and greater? When He lies down and withdraws everything
within Himself, nothing else remains—no gross or subtle matter or bodies
composed of these, no force of time or revealed scripture.

25. Supposed authorities who declare that matter is the origin of
existence, that the permanent qualities of the soul can be destroyed,
that the self is compounded of separate aspects of spirit and matter,
or that material transactions constitute reality—all such authorities
base their teachings on mistaken ideas that hide the truth. The dualistic
conception that the living entity is produced from the three modes of
nature is simply a product of ignorance. Such a conception has no real
basis in You, for You are transcendental to all illusion and always
enjoy perfect, total awareness.

26. The three modes of material nature comprise everything in this
world—from the simplest phenomena to the complex human body. Although
these phenomena appear real, they are only a false reflection of the
spiritual reality, being a superimposition of the mind upon You. Still,
those who know the Supreme Self consider the entire material creation
to be real inasmuch as it is nondifferent from the Self. Just as things
made of gold are indeed not to be rejected, since their substance is
actual gold, so this world is undoubtedly nondifferent from the Lord
who created it and then entered within it.

27. The devotees who worship You as the shelter of all beings disregard
Death and place their feet on his head. But with the words of the Vedas
You bind the nondevotees like animals, though they be vastly learned
scholars. It is Your affectionate devotees who can purify themselves
and others, not those who are inimical to You.

28. Though You have no material senses, You are the self-effulgent
sustainer of everyone’s sensory powers. The demigods and material nature
herself offer You tribute, while also enjoying the tribute offered them
by their worshipers, just as subordinate rulers of various districts in a
kingdom offer tribute to their lord, the ultimate proprietor of the land,
while also enjoying the tribute paid them by their own subjects. In this
way the universal creators faithfully execute their assigned services
out of fear of You.

29. O eternally liberated, transcendental Lord, Your material energy
causes the various moving and nonmoving species of life to appear by
activating their material desires, but only when and if You sport with
her by briefly glancing at her. You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
see no one as an intimate friend and no one as a stranger, just as the
ethereal sky has no connection with perceptible qualities. In this sense
You resemble a void.

30. If the countless living entities were all-pervading and possessed
forms that never changed, You could not possibly be their absolute ruler,
O immutable one. But since they are Your localized expansions and their
forms are subject to change, You do control them. Indeed, that which
supplies the ingredients for the generation of something is necessarily
its controller because a product never exists apart from its ingredient
cause. It is simply illusion for someone to think that he knows the
Supreme Lord, who is equally present in each of His expansions, since
whatever knowledge one gains by material means must be imperfect.

31. Neither material nature nor the soul who tries to enjoy her are ever
born, yet living bodies come into being when these two combine, just as
bubbles form where water meets the air. And just as rivers merge into
the ocean or the nectar from many different flowers blends into honey,
so all these conditioned beings eventually merge back into You, the
Supreme, along with their various names and qualities.

32. The wise souls who understand how Your Maya deludes all human beings
render potent loving service to You, who are the source of liberation
from birth and death. How, indeed, can fear of material life affect
Your faithful servants? On the other hand, Your furrowing eyebrows—the
triple-rimmed wheel of time—repeatedly terrify those who refuse to take
shelter of You.

33. The mind is like an impetuous horse that even persons who have
regulated their senses and breath cannot control. Those in this world
who try to tame the uncontrolled mind, but who abandon the feet of their
spiritual master, encounter hundreds of obstacles in their cultivation
of various distressful practices. O unborn Lord, they are like merchants
on a boat in the ocean who have failed to employ a helmsman.

34. To those persons who take shelter of You, You reveal Yourself as
the Supersoul, the embodiment of all transcendental pleasure. What
further use have such devotees for their servants, children or bodies,
their wives, money or houses, their land, good health or conveyances? And
for those who fail to appreciate the truth about You and go on pursuing
the pleasures of sex, what could there be in this entire world—a place
inherently doomed to destruction and devoid of significance—that could
give them real happiness?

35. Sages free from false pride live on this earth by frequenting the
sacred pilgrimage sites and those places where the Supreme Lord displayed
His pastimes. Because such devotees keep Your lotus feet within their
hearts, the water that washes their feet destroys all sins. Anyone
who even once turns his mind toward You, the ever-blissful Soul of all
existence, no longer dedicates himself to serving family life at home,
which simply robs a man of his good qualities.

36. It may be proposed that this world is permanently real because it is
generated from the permanent reality, but such an argument is subject
to logical refutation. Sometimes, indeed, the apparent nondifference
of a cause and its effect fails to prove true, and at other times the
product of something real is illusory. Furthermore, this world cannot be
permanently real, for it partakes of the natures of not only the absolute
reality but also the illusion disguising that reality. Actually, the
visible forms of this world are just an imaginary arrangement resorted
to by a succession of ignorant persons in order to facilitate their
material affairs. With their various meanings and implications, the
learned words of Your Vedas bewilder all persons whose minds have been
dulled by hearing the incantations of sacrificial rituals.

37. Since this universe did not exist prior to its creation and will no
longer exist after its annihilation, we conclude that in the interim
it is nothing more than a manifestation imagined to be visible within
You, whose spiritual enjoyment never changes. We liken this universe
to the transformation of various material substances into diverse
forms. Certainly those who believe that this figment of the imagination
is substantially real are less intelligent.

38. The illusory material nature attracts the minute living entity
to embrace her, and as a result he assumes forms composed of her
qualities. Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must
undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the
same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession
of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences.

39. Members of the renounced order who fail to uproot the last traces of
material desire in their hearts remain impure, and thus You do not allow
them to understand You. Although You are present within their hearts,
for them You are like a jewel worn around the neck of a mall who has
totally forgotten it is there. O Lord, those who pratice yoga only for
sense gratification must suffer punishment both in this life and the next:  
from death, who will not release them, and from You, whose kingdom they
cannot reach.

40. When a person realizes You, he no longer cares about his good and
bad fortune arising from past pious and sinful acts, since it is You
alone who control this good and bad fortune. Such a realized devotee
also disregards what ordinary living beings say about him. Every day
he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by
the unbroken succession of Manu’s descendants, and thus You become his
ultimate salvation.

41. Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You
Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes,
each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to
wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The
srutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from
the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion.
