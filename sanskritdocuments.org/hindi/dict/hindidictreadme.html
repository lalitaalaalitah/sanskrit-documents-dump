<BR>Namaskar Srinivas,
	<BR>I am Amba Kulkarni, from Language Technologies Research Center,
International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad.
	Here are the clarifications/information you are looking for.

<OL>
<LI>Our group has been working in the area of Natural Language
Processing for last two decades. The major contribution of the group
is
in the development of  anusaarakas (language accessors).
	As a side product many bilingual dictionaries have been developed
by our group. They are
	Telugu-Hindi; 
	Kannada-Hindi; 
	Marathi-Hindi; 
	Punjabi-Hindi; 
	Bengali-Hindi; 
<BR>All these dictionaries are available at
http://www.iiit.net/ltrc/downloads.html
for free download under GPL.

Online dictionary search interface is also available for online search
at http://www.iiit.net/ltrc/onlineservices.html

<P>In addition there are morphological analysers for some of the Indian
langauges.

<P>Funding for this work was through TDIL project, DOE,India.

<LI>Since 1999, funding for our group is from Satyam Computers.
The English-Hindi dictionary as well as its new version Sabdaanjali
have
been developed during this period. Though many volunteers (from school
children, teachers, house wives to retired persons, from various
parts of
India ) have contributed to the dictionary, the core group of this
activity is being supported by Satyam Computers.

<P>Dr. Dipti Misra Sharma(dipti_{}abcdiiit.net) is the chief editor of this
dictionary.

<P>This dictionary(like other dictionaries on our site) is also available
under GPL.

<LI>The Classical Hindi Literature that you see on our web site is
mainly the one-man voluntary effort by Shri. Balaram Rathore, a
retired
Railway driver, at Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh, India
</OL>

Hi,

Thank you for the reply and for nice words about the site.

1. I would like to acknowledge the people involved before I release it
for public. Any additional information on the source of English to
Hindi
is appreciated. Shree: Can you give me any more details?

2. What should be the mechanism to add/correct the dictionary? Can I
redirect users to Sanskrit_{}abcdcheerful.com? How can I get updated
versions
of the dictionary? I am currently using tab-delimited ITX version,
which
serves my purpose very well.

3. Aksharamala product is certainly my brain-child but it certainly is
not one man effort. Although, I have been working fulltime on this
project for close to two years now, I also have a graphic designer and
few other people for marketing. Our company is incorporated in India.
We
are also planning to setup a real office in India soon.

I am not sure if have heard of return2india.com. I have created that
site and SIFY bought it over in 2000. Of course, the site used to be
maintained better then :-)

4. I know Shree since he provided lot of feedback for Aksharamala and
had few emails with Vineet-ji (from IIIT, I presume), who are others?
I
would like to get to know more about all of you.

5. Would any of you or anyone you know be interested in creating
content
in Hindi? Specifically for Hindi section front-page in Hindi would be
nice. Same goes for Marathi and Sanskrit (in future). Although, as of
now, I won't be able to pay for your time I can certainly provide with
few licenses of Aksharamala.

6. Do you know of any other content that is in GPL or other
source-able
formats? 

What about other content on
sanskrit.bhaarat.com/The_Document_Project/hindi/ are they GPL'ed too?
I
can gladly convert the Bhajans, Chalisas to Unicode and host them in
Hindi section. But, I can't figure out their licensing by reading the
page. 

As of you now, Hindi, Marathi and Sanskrit are priority. Gujarati,
Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and others are coming soon.

Btw, by any chance are you related to Harshad Abhyankar (returned from
US to Pune before a year or so)

Regards,
Srinivas

Srinivas,

The dictionary was supplied by IIIT from TDIL.  See the note in
http://sanskrit.bhaarat.com/The_Document_Project/hindi/  (since the
the
main gde.to site is down at the moment)

"The dictionary has been encoded by Technology Development for Indian
Languages as part of the Anusaaraka project. The files which are in
ISCII format have been made freely available under the GNU general
public license."  The TDIL's new site is
http://tdil.mit.gov.in/download/menu.htm.

I have copied the message to a few friends who may know more about it.
It was reformatted for presentation by Shree Devi Kumar.  I think it
was
entered/translated by people in Ratlam and provided by group of people
at Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) at Hyderabad.

Charles Wikner has written Sanskrit Introductory tutorial but not the
dictionary.

Your Aksharamala site is well done.  The English-Hindi search engine
is
also appealing.
Is yours a one man effort at deshweb.com?

Hope this helps.
