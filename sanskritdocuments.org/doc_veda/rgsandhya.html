Introduction
============

From time immemorial man has been preparing to face
uncertainties and struggling to overcome difficulties in
life. Broadly speaking the difficulties and conflicts he
faces can be categorised as physical on the one extreme and
spiritual on the other, intervened by various other stages
like ethical, intellectual, emotional, filial, occupational,
professional, societal, national and so on. While enormous
education, training and efforts go into tackling difficulties,
conflicts and uncertainties at the basest physical level
onwards, these are waning with the progression to the noblest
spiritual level. It is towards strengthening in this direction
that man has evolved rituals and faith in that Universal
Power and set out in search thereof. Ideally, man should turn
everything he does into sacred with a view to know himself and
his God and towards this strengthen all his faculties. SandhyA
vandana, worship of Gods three times a day at the junctures
of Night-Morning-afternoon-evening, invoking their blessings
and strength, is one such important activity.

Brahmanas
=========

A Brahmana deserves to be called so only when he
conducts himself in the ways approved in the scriptures
and also performs at least the basic ritual called trikAla
SandhyA-vandana. SandhyA vandana is a daily duty for a Brahmana
after upanayana. It is very auspicious and sacred also. TrikAla
SandhyA vandana means paying obeisance to the Lord, three times
a day, i.e., during sun rise, noon and sun-set. It is called
SandhyA Vandana also because the obeisance is offered at the
junctures of 1. Night and day, 2. morning and afternoon, and
3. Day and night. The first one, prAtaH SandhyA, is performed
when the sun is about to rise and the stars are still aglitter
in the sky. The second one, mAdhyAhnika, is performed during
the noon time. The third one sAyaM sandhyA, is performed just
before the sunset. These junction times are regarded as highly
sacred for this purpose.

Preparation
===========

The basic preparation is to cleanse the body externally.
For prAtaH SandhyA, it will be by means of the morning bath
and for the other two it will be by means of washing the
legs, hands and face. After this, You will wear clean clothes
specially meant for this purpose.  The practice is to wear a
dhoti and a shalya.

Thereafter, quietly sit on either a kR^iShNAjina (deer-skin
seat) or on wooden plaque placed on the floor, in the pooja
room (select some other neat place if pooja room is not
available. While for prAtaH SandhyA you can face either East
or North, for the other two you have necessarily to face
North. Keep readily available minimum three vessels, two
with clean water (one for Achamana and the other for Arghya)
and ladle (spoon) and the third one empty (arghya pAtra).
Also ensure that you have complete privacy during the whole
process and avoid external noises like music systems, TV,
talking to others etc.

You will also take the following steps for prAtaH SandhyA
only. Keep a set of mudras (five metallic stamps with different
shapes explained later) and gopichandana (a special variety of
mud ball). Then, apply gopichandana on your body. Generally,
if available, nirmalya tIrtha (holy remnant water after deva
pooja by self or someone) is used for this purpose. In case
of unavailability of nirmAlya tIrtha i.e. Arghya Water can
also be used.

Start the process invoking the blessings of the Lord by reciting
the following mantras.

श्री लक्ष्मीवेङ्कटेशाय नमः ॥

श्री गुरुभ्यो नमः । परम गुरुभ्यो नमः ॥

श्रीमदानन्दतीर्थ भगवत्पादाचार्य गुरुभ्यो नमः ॥

श्री वेदव्यासाय नमः ॥

हरिः ॐ ॥

गोपीचन्दन पापघ्न विष्णुदेह समुद्भव ।
चक्राङ्कित नमस्तेऽस्तु धारण मुक्तिदो भव ॥

Simultaneously, place a spoon of water (either nirmalya
or Arghya Water) on the left hand palm, take a piece
of gopichandana, rub vigorously and prepare a paste of
gopichandana. Apply this paste at 12 places in the body - one on
forehead, three on abdomen, one on chest, one each on shoulders,
all 4 parts of neck, one on bottom of back-bone just above trunk
and one on top of head. Then, one more is applied on the right
side of the chest.  Some people do also apply a similar final
mark on the left side of the chest, if this is the tradition
that they have been taught as per their sampradAya (custom).
While applying, recite Keshavadi Dwadashanama (explained below),
one nAma each for one application.

The order for applying nAmas are -- on the forehead (keshavAya
namaH), center of abdomen (nArAyaNAya namaH), chest (mAdhavAya
namaH), front portion of neck (govindAya namaH), right side
of abdomen (viShNave namaH), right shoulder (madhusudhanAya
namaH), right side of neck (trivikramAya namaH), left side of
abdomen (vAmanAya namaH), left shoulder (shrIdharAya namaH),
left side of neck (hR^iShIkeshAya namaH), back side (above
tunk) (padmanAbhAya namaH), back side of neck (dAmodarAya
namaH) and on the head, on the chest (shrIvatsAya namaH).
The shapes of the paste applied will be as follows. On the
forehead : one set of vertical parallel lines (first apply the
paste with the forefinger and later run through it with a wet
cloth/finger). On the chest: heart (lotus leaf) shape. On the
shoulder: leaf shape (preferably with a stem).  Elsewhere:  
deepAkAra (burning candle light shape). Concentrate on the
mantra and quickly go through the process of applying the
paste instead of trying to perfect the shapes.

After applying gopichandana, apply mudras as follows in
that order.

chakra mudra: one on right side of eye, five on centre of
abdomen, three on heart, two on right of abdomen, three on
right of chest, two on right shoulder both sides of nAma, two
on right of neck, one on front of neck, one on left shoulder
below the nAma.

shankha mudra - one on left side of eye, one on left of abdomen,
two on left of chest, two on left shoulder both sides of nAma,
two on left of neck, one on right shoulder below the nAma.

gadA mudra - one on forehead, one on left of abdomen, one on
left of chest, two on left shoulder both sides of nAma below
shankha mudra.

padma mudra - two on chest, two on right abdomen, two on right
shoulder both sides of nAma below chakra mudra.

nArAyaNa mudra - one each overlapping on all mudras and nAma.

अपवित्रः पवित्रो वा सर्वावस्थां गतोऽपि वा ।
यः स्मरेत्पुण्डरीकाक्षं सबाह्याभ्यन्तरः शुचिः ॥

प्राणायामः ................... (2)

(This is preamble for Gayatri Awahana i.e. welcome, for this
Sri Hari or ParamAtmA is R^iShi devatA and devI gAyatrI is
Channdassu.  Practice of prANAyAmah cleanses one of impurities
and provides a resurgence of spiritual energy to revitalize
one's sAdhana.

In order to extinguish the sins or effect of base deeds in the
previous night for prAtaH SandhyA this verse is uttered. The
pramAna says that this mantra will destroy all the sins
committed previously or previous night if it is prAtaH SandhyA,
morning if it is mandhyanika SandhyA and it is afternoon till
evening if it is sAyam SandhyA.)

ॐ प्रणवस्य परब्रह्म ऋषिः । परमात्मा देवता ।
देवी गायत्री छन्दः । प्राणायामे विनियोगः ॥

ॐ भूः । ॐ भुवः । ॐ स्वः । ॐ महः । ॐ जनः । ॐ तपः ।
ॐ सत्यं । ॐ तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं । भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि धीयो यो नः
प्रचोदयात् । ॐ आपोज्योतीरसोऽमृतं ब्रह्म भुर्भुवःस्वरोम् ॥

(A married man should hold the nose in all His five fingers
while performing this and bachelors and saints/seers should hold
through three fingers i.e.  index, thumb and small fingers. This
prANAyAmaH has three parts to perform and it is called rechaka,
pUraka and kumbhaka. To start with one has to leave the air
from right side of the nose (1 unit of time) that is called
rechaka, secondly one has to inhale the air from left side of
nose (2 units of time) i.e. called pUraka and finally holding
the air for 3 units of time i.e. is called kumbhaka.

Meaning of this mantra is as follows : OM = ParamAtmA who
has all the virtues is to be called OM, bhUH = gunapUrna
(complete virtues or characters), bhuvaH = wealthy and never
become pauper or most prosperous, svaH = always happy, mahaH =
prayed as the best or excellent, janaH = creation of the world
by Him, tapaH = one who has the complete knowledge, satyaM =
one who controls or decides about the liberation.

yaH = this paramAtmA, naH = ours, dhIyaH = mind, prachodayAt
= initiates, tasya = of this paramathmA, savituH = cause of
creation, devasya = special characters, vareNyaM = prayed by
all, bharga = paramAthmA in knowledge form, dhImahi = pray
for Him.

Apo = paramAtmA, jyoti = cause of brightness, rasaH = has got
essence or substance or Ananda rUpa peaceful, amR^itaM = does
not have extinction, bhUH = complete virtues or characters,
bhuvaH = prosperous and wealthy always, svaH = always happy,
OM brahma = all virtues of ParamAtmA, dhImahi = praying for You.

The gist of this verse is:  

Sri Hari in the form of Sri Gayatri is complete with all divine
virtues, always prosperous and wealthy, always happy, considered
to be the best or excellent, one who creates this world, one who
regulates this world and one who is being prayed by all of us.

Further, Sri Hari or paramAtmA also has the power of creating
the brightness (enlightenment), does not have extinction,
has complete knowledge, is always prosperous and wealthy and
has got complete virtues, is the paramAtmA (Supreme Being)
whom I am praying.)

सङ्कल्पः ..................... (3)

(Hold right palm over the left palm and keep them on the
right thigh and utter the following mantra )

श्री शुभे शोभने मुहूर्ते विष्णोराज्ञया प्रवर्तमानस्य
आद्य ब्रह्मणः द्वितीये परार्धे श्री श्वेतवराह कल्पे
वैवस्वत मन्वन्तरे अष्टाविंशतितमे कलियुगे प्रथमपादे

अमुक तिथौ    अमुक वासरे    अमुक नक्षत्रे   शुभयोग

लक्ष्मीनारायण प्रेरणया श्री लक्ष्मीनारायण प्रीत्यर्थं
प्रातः सन्ध्यामुपाशिष्ये ।

(For any prayer or performance of any sacred work whether
it is SandhyA, puja, yagna, or any ritual performed by any
individual this customary sankalpa has to be narrated. It
denotes the commitment and determination of the performer
to rightfully and sincerely perform such sacred rituals.
Here in this sankalpa it is nothing but remembering which
of the samvatsara (year), period or season (R^itau), month
(mAse), the half of lunar month (pakShe), lunar day (tithau),
day (vAsare), star of the day (nakShatre) has to be to according
to the calendar. KAla, i.e. kAladevata is equally God. Even one
has to remember that the prayer is initiated by paramAtmA and
to get His blessings and love, I am performing the respective
ritual.  This is a must as it has been understood that without
this sankalpa the prayer or ritual will not materialise or
not received by the God.

The need for this is to totally concentrate on the present
moment instead of the usual mind's habit of either brooding
over the past or dreaming of the future.)

मार्जनम् ....................... (4)

(Keep a spoon or ladle of water (Arghya Water) in the left
hand and from tulasi or basil leaves sprinkle the water in three
different directions to the organs of the body. Firstly one has
to sprinkle feet, centre of the head and heart, secondly heart,
feet and centre of the head and finally centre of the head,
heart and feet like this one has to sprinkle three ways or
nine times)

ॐ आपोहिष्ठेति त्र्यर्चस्य सूक्तस्य । सिन्धुद्वीप ऋषिः ।
अपो देवता गायत्री छन्दः । मार्जने विनियोगः ॥   ........ (4.1)

ॐ आपोहिष्ठा मयो भुवः । ता न ऊर्जे दधातन ।
महेरणाय चक्षसे । योवः शिवतमो रसः ।
तस्य भाजयते हनः । उशतीरिव मातरः ।
तस्मा अरङ्ग मामवः यस्य क्षयाय जिन्वथ ।
आपोजनयथा च नः ॥   ........ (4.2)

(mArjanam means cleansing or scouring. It is again purifying
the body and mind for offering Arghya and chanting Gayatri
mantra.

For R^ik mantras sindhudvIpa is R^iShiH, paramAtmA is devatA
and Gayatri is Chandassu.

Here is the substance of this verse. It is prayer to Water
related devatAs (aqua-Gods).

᳚ Hey, Water related devatAs, You are bestowing on us happiness
by causing the water to flow, and You bless us with grains
and other related needs and also confer on us devotion and
knowledge towards Sri Hari which guides all of us in the path
of liberation. ᳚

᳚ Hey, Water related devatAs, You are auspicious, You are very
eminent, You are bestowing on us happiness and joy and confer on
all of us love like mothers feeding and protecting their newborn
kids. In order to destroy the sins which we have committed and
also to acquire knowledge we are praying Sri Narayana who is
omnipresent in the water and whom we are praying to bless us to
lead a happy life and also to liberate us at the earliest. ᳚ )

जलाभिमन्त्रणम् ...................... (5)

(While uttering this, take a spoon of water (Arghya Water)
and sip it after completing the following portion)

सूर्यश्चेत्यस्य मन्त्रस्य । नारायण ऋषिः ।
सूर्यमामन्यु मन्युपतयो रात्रिर्देवता ।
प्रकृतिश्छन्दः । जलाभिमन्त्रणे विनियोगः ॥   ........ (5.1)

ॐ ॥ सूर्यश्चमामन्युश्चमन्युपतयश्च मन्युकृतेभ्यः ।
पापेभ्योरक्षन्ताम् । यद्रात्र्या पापमकार्षम् ।
मनसा वाचा हस्ताभ्याम् । पद्भ्यामुदरेण शिश्ना ।
रात्रिस्तदवलुम्पतु । यत्किञ्च दुरितं मयि ।
इदमहं माममृतयोनौ सूर्ये ज्योतिषि जुहोमि स्वाहा ॥  ........ (5.2)

(The verse which has started with sUryascha, Narayana is
R^ishi, manyupathi ratri niyamaka durga is devatA and it is
in prakR^iti Chandassu.

᳚ Hey, paramAtmA, You are the one who controls the Sun who is
very bright, You are the one who controls Sri Rudra who is known
for His wildness You protect us from the sins which are caused
by the ferocity and the initiatives of Sri Rudra devatAs. ᳚

᳚ Hey, paramAtmA, please also protect me from not committing
sins like, sins during night times, sins from mind, sins by
mouth or talking or speaking, sins through hands, sins from
feet, sins from belly and sins through the sex organs. If
I commit any sins, ratrI abhimani (related) devatA should
bless me to wipe it off and if any of my sins are over, I
am performing homa (burnt offering) of the same to You i.e.,
Sri Narayana who is shining in the form of Sun . ᳚ )

(The first three verses are already dealt in mArjanam para (4).

᳚ Apashabda vAchya Sri ParamAtma, You bless us with the wealth
of needs like drinking water, happiness and good health. ᳚
(6.3)

᳚ Apashabda vAchya Sri ParamAthma, the grains which are grown
through water mainly referring to rice and like food grains,
You are the owner. You confer on us the knowledge of medicine
to destroy sAnsArik troubles for two and four legged animals. ᳚
(6.4)

᳚ There are different medicines in water which can cure many
diseases. Hey, ParamAtma You have manifested in the form of
of water to bless us with the knowledge to understand these
curative medicines. ᳚   (6.5)

᳚ Hey, ParamAtma, bless us with the preventive medicine
i.e. knowledge for all diseases of my body and soul so that
for long time I can visualize You in my life. ᳚  (6.6)

᳚ Hey, ParamAtma, if I have committed any sins, if I have
betrayed anybody and if I have cursed anybody or if I have
mistaken any body please pardon me. ᳚  (6.7)

᳚ Hey, ParamAtma, now I am following Your directions and Your
principles and I am drowning in water, You are like fire in
the water and rescue me and infuse in me Your energies. ᳚  (6.8)

There is a definite relationship between water and Narayana. Sri
Hari is incarnated and is omnipresent in water. Sri Hari
created water-related amruta (knowledge) to lead us towards
liberation. For this purpose He created day and night abhmimani
(related) devatAs. For acquisition of knowledge and protection
of my body (from any diseases) I am welcoming You (Narayana)
to reside in my soul and body.  (6.9))

Water) in right-palm then after completing the verse inhale
the water from right side of the nose and exhale the air from
the left side of the nose and pour out the water on the earth
on one's left side.

This verse is from pApaparihari RishiH, satya and bhakti devatA
and anuShTup Chanddassu . You should have the feeling that
in order to extinguish the sins committed you are offering,
symbolically, a spoon full of water.  (7.1)

Before Brahma thought about anything, ParamAtma created truth,
from the same ParamAtma night was born and from the same
ParamAthma ocean was born.

ParamAtma, the supreme head of everything, created the following
in that order: four-headed Brahma, night, day and all kinds
of living beings.

ParamAtma, one who is the cause of creation has created first
the Sun and the moon, then He created heaven, then He created
the universe, then He created the sky and then He created
heavenly bodies.  (7.2))

both the hands should fold make like cow's face or bowl and
it should be up to your nose's height.

Write this figure (yantra) and words (preferably in devanagari
script) using your small finger in the bowl where arghya
offering water (Arghya Water) has been kept:

                               ॐ
                               / 
                              /   
                        स्वः / वं  भूः

                           /

                              भुवः

There is story behind this offering Arghya : Mandeha's
were powerful AsurAs (demons) and they are devoted to Sri
Brahma. They got a boon from Him that even if they die one
day they should be born the next day. They were trying to
consume the Sun God himself as a result of these Arghyas;
Whenever they were killed, because of Brahma's blessings they
are born the next day. It is believed this process goes on even
now. In order to kill these AsurAs and to protect the Sun God
for illuminating all of us, we have to offer three Arghyas on
each occasion. Three Arghyas are offered as follows: the first
one is to destroy the AsurAs' vehicle, the second to destroy
their weapons and the third to kill them. This story has been
explained in Vishnu Purana of 8th chapter.

If the prescribed time for performing SandhyA has passed,
You have to offer the fourth Arghya as compensation.)

(For pratichakShva verse VashiShta is R^ishI, Moon and
Indra are devatAs and anuShTup Channadassu. This verse is for
obtaining eligibility and capability for offering Arghya and
protection of the soul.

The presence of Moon and Indra is invoked to watch out AsurAs
see that the later will not spoil the process of performing
SandhyA and prevent the performer realising the benefits
thereof. It is believed that both Sun and Indra are capable
of killing or destroying these AsurAs, who cause impediments
and even destroy the process of performing sacred rituals.
The Lord Indra, the head of devatAs, uses His weapon, Vajrayudha
for the purpose.)

with the first 12 names of Vishnu (keshava etc.) and during
krishna pakSha (second half of lunar month) it is given with
the 12 names starting from sankarshana. The procedure for
giving tarpaNa is: take one ladle full of water from Arghya
Water in left hand and pour it on right hand fingers so that
it falls through the fingers (except thumb) to 'Arghya PAtra'.
This tarpaNa should not be given on ekadashi, gokulAShTami)

devatA and anuShTup Chandassu.

Meaning : All AsurAs living on this earth should
disappear. Those AsurAs who obstruct good and sacred work
should be destroyed by the orders of Sri Rudra devatA.

It is a prayer to the existing devatAs who are present in
different forms and taking their permission to start the sacred
SandhyA and request or pray to them to destroy all AsurAs,
devils etc. who are obstructing the ritual.)

(Those who have got the upadesha of  tatvanyAsa, mAtR^ikAnyAsa

(Paravasu was killed, I am living in the hearts of
arvahasu. This has been told by Surya (Sun). By reciting
this cut a thread of the cloth worn by you and make two small
pieces. Throw the one on the left hand, on the left side and
keep the other under the seat.

Silently think like this. Earth is like four poles i.e. four
sides (North, South, East and West) having a seat like the
turtle/tortoise (referring to kurma incarnation). I am sitting
on that. ParmAtma is sleeping on top of snake (shesha) bed. I
am bowing to You. I am bowing to Vishnu Kurma (tortoise)
one who is protecting the earth (Brahmanda) from destruction.

For Prithvi verse merupR^iShTha is R^ishi kUrma (tortoise)
is the devatA sutalam is Channdassu. After this, settle on
the seat for chanting Gayatri MantraH.

Prayer to Prithvi i.e. earth. All regions of Loka are covered
by You, Prithvi Namaka Daivi, You are decorated by Vishnu vakya
ParamAtma. Hey, Prithivi, You authorise me by purifying the
seat where I am sitting.  Prithivi, You also purify me. You
are very special and I am bowing You.  By uttering this,
touch the seat and bow to it.

ParamAtma is called as OM; He has got the form of Brahma and
Agni devatA.  Like the same Brahma is R^ishi, Gayatri Chanddassu
and in the form of OM.

'AyAtu' verse is to welcome Gayatri. For this verse Vasudevaka
ParamAthma is R^ishi, Gayatri Pratipadya Narayana is devatA
and it is in anuShTup Channdassu.

᳚ Hey, Wealth bestowing devatA, bless us with Brahma verse
(Gayatri) which is immortal and is considered to be the mother
of all Vedas (Gayatri); Please bless me Para Brahma (Gayatri
verse). By uttering this Gayatri verse all the sins committed
by me in my daily life will be destroyed (extinguished). ᳚

᳚ I am praying to ParamAthma, who is in the form of Saraswathi
who is also SandhyA devatA and knowledge devatA. Please
extinguish, through the night related devatA who is none other
than Sri Hari, all my sins committed in the night. ᳚

This is a prayer to ParamAtma who is in the form of Gayatri. ᳚
Hey, ParamAtma - You are instrumental for everything, You
have all the patience, You have all the powers, You have the
vision, for devatAs You are Sharanya (protecting them), You
are omnipresent, You have complete form, You are controlling
everything, You are instrumental for everybody's life-activities
and enemies are being defeated by Your single word 'OM'. By
all the above things You are being called Paramatma by the
name Gayatri, the same Gayatri I am inviting in my mind
(AhvAna), I am welcoming Savitri, I am welcoming Saraswati,
I am inviting Chhanddassu, R^ishis, Parabrahma, I am inviting
LakShmi and Vayu who is well known for His powers. ᳚

For Gayatri verse, Gayatri is Channdassu, Vishwamitra is R^ishi
and ParamAtma who is called very sacred (savitR^inamaka). This
ParamAtma is in the following form : His appearance is like fire
in His body, His face is like four headed Brahma, He has got
the heart which is covered by the whole universe, He appears
like Rudra, He has the Sankarshana's hair, He is the earth,
He has yoni sthana, He has five vital airs like prANa, apAna,
vyAna, udAna and samAna and He has upa prANa like devadatta,
kurma, kR^ikara, dhananjaya and nAga, His colour appears like
blood and He belongs to sankhyasana gotra. He has been called
in 24 keshava nAmas, His presence is there in all three places
i.e.. earth, vaikuntha and pAtAla, He has covered in all four
regions (i.e. North, South, East and West), He has five heads
like vyakarana, shikSha, kalpa, nirukta and jyotiSha this
Gayatri I am praying and worshipping.)

(For this Gayathri verse, Vishwamitra is R^ishi, Sri LakShmi
Narayana is devatA, in order to impress Sri LakShmi Narayana,
and in order to get love and affection from Sri LakShmi Narayana
I am reciting this according to my abilities and capabilities.

While reciting the japa, imagine the following picture of
Sri LakShmi Narayana who is the subject and object of your
prayer. They are :  

Settled in the centre of the Sun, He is sitting in the posture
of a yogi (padmasana), He has been decorated with the ornament
of shoulder, He has worn ear rings, He has put head gear,
He has the necklace, He has the body of hiranya and He has
conch shell and wheel on His both hands. The same Sri LakShmi
Narayna is the subject and object of my prayer. This prayer is
initiated by Sri LakShmi Narayana and I am praying to please
Him and to get love from Him. I am chanting this verse sincerely
according to my abilities and capabilities.

Take note of the following guidelines while reciting Gayatri Japa :  

1. Laughing/Smiling, talking with others, looking here and
there, sitting other than in the posture of yogi, hands
together, allowing the mind to wander, touching the places
which are below the navel portion etc., which are all unholy,
should not be done.

2. Reciting should be with calmness and peace of mind.

3. PrataH SandhyA Gayathri japa can be recited by standing
and facing towards the East till the Sunrise. Later it can be
recited either standing or sitting.  But Madhyanika Gayathri
japa and Sayam SandhyA Gayathri japa should be recited only
sitting.

4. While counting the beads, cover the right hand either by the
left hand or with a cloth and the number of Gayatri mantraH to
be recited should be ten or in geometrical progression thereof
(i.e. 100, 1000 etc.)

5. Pause after every 5 verses.

6. There are three methods of uttering Gayatri verses. One is
by uttering loudly, second is whispering i.e. speaking through
lips without being heard by any body and third silently chanting
in your mind, always dwelling on their meaning. It is believed
that the third method is better than the second and second
one is better than the first.

7. Counting of the Gayatri verses should be done through finger
beads on circular basis in clockwise direction. Start counting
from middle bead of ring finger (1), come down to bottom bead
(2), traverse through bottom (3), middle (4) and top bead (5)
of little finger, top of ring finger (6),
 8. Hands should rest just above the navel during Pratah
 SandhyA, on the
chest during Madhyahnika and on the nose during Sayam SandhyA.

9. Generally, the Gayatri japa should be performed at the same
place where SandhyA is performed.)

(It is also believed that one should recite nArAyaNa

proportion, i.e.for every 10 Gayatri, you should recite 30
narayana aShTAkShara mantra. After reciting that, for every
10 Narayana aShTAkShara MantraH you should offer one Arghya
i.e. in above case you have to offer 3 Arghyas.)

(For jATavedasE verse kashyapa is R^ishi, jATadevagni is
devatA, triShTup Channdasu.

It is a prayer to ParamAtma to extinguish the impact of all
our sins. ᳚ Hey, ParamAtma, please solve or extinguish all our
sins like the boats crossing the stormy ocean, here ocean is
like Samsaric hurdles and boat or ship is like You and You
have to take through these difficulties and make us happy.
It is also said that You are the cause of knowledge and I
pray to you confer that knowledge on us to solve our problems
like crushing the somalata (juice) or crushing the enemies or
burning enemies, who come out cause difficulties in our life,
with the knowledge acquired. ᳚  (12.1)

For taChayo verse shamu is R^ishi, vishwa devatA is devatA,
shakwari is channddassu. To take refuge with ParamAtma this
verse is being uttered.

This prayer is for ParamAthma who is in the form of Dhanvanthri
- God for all medicines.

I am praying You to confer on me with all kinds of medicines
which can cure my existing diseases and also bless me with
the preventive medicines for any possible future diseases also.

I am praying to confer on me the determination to perform all
my duties, including the sacred work like yagna (burnt offering)
to attain salvation, with sincerity and dedication

I would like to attain MokSha like any other devatAs by doing
only sAtvik work in my life.

I would like to win over the heart of ParamAtma, who is in the
form of Gayatri and who can bless me to solve or extinguish all
problems in my mundane life and bless me with the remedies and
who keeps all human beings, all animals and all other living
beings happy.  (12.2)

For namo brahmane verse vAma deva is R^ishi, lingothkya devatA

I am bowing to Veda, I am bowing to Fire and related devatAs,
I am bowing to the universe, I am bowing to medicines, I am

omnipresent in this universe, including mountains. I am praying
to You to get liberated and I know You will listen and even
obey those who are devoted (brahmins) to You.

Gayantri mantra as it will confer on me virtues of uttering
complete Vedas, it will confer on me virtues of taking bath
in all holy rivers and I am praying this Mantra to Sri Hari
who will kill or destroy all wicked people.

Just like all rain-water falling on earth ultimately reach
the ocean, all prayers reach Keshava.

have been called Vasudeva because the entire universe has taken
refuge in You or the entire universe is inside You, all three
Lokas are in You, all jivas, living beings and animals have
taken refuge in You and You are protecting them.

You have been called Ananta, I bow to You. Anantha means
You don't have any particular place (You are omnipresent),
limitless and You are replete with divine virtues. You have
incarnated in thousands of forms, You have thousands of feet,
eyes, heads, legs, shoulders and You have been called on in
thousands of names, I bow to You, one who is holding thousand
wheels. You have been called Keshava wherein fire is present
inside You, please make my mind sacred to remember always Your
different forms.)
