         achyutAShTakam by Shri Shridhara Venkatesha.
The author Shridhara Venkatesha was a staunch devotee of Shiva but he
had no dislike for Vishnu. He had even decried the differences
displyed by people who claimed to be devotees of Siva or Vishnu to
the exclusion of the other. He believed that in this age of Kali yuga
when peoples' mind will be attacked by a million distractions making
it impossible for one to devote himself seriously to God, they can
take to chanting of His name as Shridhara believed that the name is as
potent as Him in distroying the sins of the devotee. This theme is
highlighted in this short poem. The poet addresses the name and not
the Lord as is usually the case. The power of the Lord's name in
destroying the sins is mentioned in the first verse. He cites with
wonder instances when the name came to the rescue of His devotees in
times of crises. One instance was the case of Draupathi  when she was
being subjected to humiliation and was in a helpless condition. She
cried out for help and uttered Lord's name which produced unending
piles of clothes to the amazement of all and frustrated the efforts
of those who tried to dishonour her. The poet then cites  the case of
Gagendra who was caught in a tussle with a crocodile. After a
long-drawn struggle the elephant, feeling helpless, called out loudly
the Lord's name. This made Him rush to his rescue.  The poet feels
that it was the Lord's name that worked these wonders.

LIFE OF SHRIDHARA VENKATESA
श्रीकण्ठमिव भास्वन्तं शिवनामपरायणम् ।
श्रीधरं वेङ्कटेशार्यं श्रेयसे गुरुमाश्रये ॥
Shridhara Venkatesa lived about 300 years ago in
Tiruvisanallur, a village in Tanjavur district in Tamilnadu. He was called
Tiruvisanallur Ayyaval (deeply respected person) out of great respect
people held for him. Even today he is known by that name only. He was
the son of Lingayaryar who was a minister to the Maharaja of Mysore. Even
as a young boy Ayyaval was deeply religious and in particular had great
devotion to Shiva but he made no distinction between Shiva and Vishnu. He
studied Vedas, shastras and puranas and had a great desire to travel and
spread the message of the puranas and in particular the glory of Lord's
name among the people. After his father's death the Maharaja wanted
him to take his father's job but he politely declined and left Mysore
state with his wife and mother. He came to Tiruchirapalli in Tamilnadu
and stayed for some time giving talks. He was supposed to have brought
back to life a woman who had died by praying to the Lord. This attracted
people who wanted him to solve their problems. Ayyaval did not like this
and left the place. He proceeded to Tanjavur. It seems that King Shahaji
(1684-1710.AD) who was ruling at that time in Tanjavur wanted him to
stay in Tanjavur but Ayyaval wanted to lead a quiet life. King Shahaji
was inviting scholarly brahmins to stay in his kingdom. He renamed the
village Tiruvisanallur as Shahajirajapuram. One street was allotted for
their stay. Ayyaval also stayed in a house there.  Ayyaval was a proponent
of the view that in this dark age Kali chanting the lord's name will ward
off its evil effects. He was the senior contemporary of Bodhendra Swami
who was the 59th pontiff of the Shankara Math at Kanchipuram and who was
an ardent advocate of the glory of the lord's name.  Ayyaval wrote a
book भगवन्नामभूषणम् (Bagavannamabhushanam) on the subject
which is sadly not available now. Bodhendra Swami had also written a book
नामामृतरसायनम् (Namamritarasayanam)on the subject wherein
he had made references to the work of Ayyaval.  Once Ayyaval had to
perform a sraddha ceremony in his house. Therein food is prepared and
offered to the departed forefathers who are invoked in three brahmins
invited for the occasion. When every thing was getting ready Ayyaval
saw an outcaste with his family in a famished condition begging for
food. His heart melted with compassion at their condition. Without
any hesitation he offered them the food that was being prepared for
the ceremony.He then had the house washed and prepared to conduct the
ceremony again. But the brahmins in the village considered this act
reprehensible and refused to conduct the ceremony again. Ayyaval pleaded
with them quoting texts from the scriptures to support his action but the
Brahmins were not convinced. He asked them what he should do to remedy
the situation. They said that the only atonement was having a bath in
the Ganges. But there was no time to go to Varanasi and return. So he
prayed to Lord Shiva (in Gangashtakam) to release the waters of Ganga
from His matted hair as he did on an earlier occasion for Bhagiratha.
Water started flowing out of the well in his house and flooded the
streets of the village.  The villagers got scared and prayed to Ayyaval
to forgive them and stop the flood that was threatening the village. He
accordingly prayed again to stop the flooding and requested her to appear
in the well every year on that day. Even now people flock to that place
every year on that day and take bath in the waters of the well in the
belief that Ganga is present in the well on that day.  Ayyaval had
composed a number of works some of which are not yet been printed and
some not available. Some of his works are listed below.  (1) Bhagavannama
Bhushanam. (2) Akhyashashti. (3) Daya satakam. (4) Matrubhtasatakam. (5)
Stuti paddati. (6) Shivabhakthikalpalatha. (7) Shivabhaktha lakShanam. (8)
Taravali stotram. (9) Artihara stotram.  (10) Kuliresvarashtakam. (11)
Jambhunathashtakam. (12) Doshapariharashtakam.  (13) Krishnadwadasa
manjari. (14) Achyuthashtakam. (15) Dola navarathnamala.  (16)
Padamanimanjari - a sanskrit dictionary. (17) Shahajiraja charitam.
