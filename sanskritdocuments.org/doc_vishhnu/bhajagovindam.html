<h2 itemprop="headline">Introduction</h2>

Bhaja Govindam was written by Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya.
A biography of Shankara and his other compositions of Vedic
literature can be found in the shankara.itx document.  Bhaja
govindaM is one of the minor compositions of the spiritual giant,
Adi Shankaracharya. It is classified as a prakaraNa grantha, a
primer to the major works. Though sung as a bhajan, it contains
the essence of Vedanta and implores the man to think, Why am I
here in this life ? Why am I amassing wealth, family, but have
no peace ? What is the Truth ? What is the purpose of life ?
The person thus awakened gets set on a path to the inner road
back to the God principle.

The background of Bhaja GovindaM is worth examining. During his
stay in Kashi, Adi Shankaracharya noticed a very old man studying
the rules of Sanskrit by Panini.  Shankara was touched with pity
at seeing the plight of the old man spending his years at a mere
intellectual accomplishment while he would be better off praying
and spending time to control his mind.

Shankara understood that the majority of the world was also
engaged in mere intellectual, sense pleasures and not in the
divine contemplation. Seeing this, he burst forth with the verses
of Bhaja govindaM.  In 31 verses, he, like no other, explains our
fallacies, our wrong outlook for life, and dispels our ignorance
and delusions. Thus bhaja govindaM was originally known as moha
mudgAra, the remover of delusions.

Shankara explains, nay chides, us for spending our time in useless
trivia like amassing wealth, lusting after (wo)men and requests us
to discriminate and cultivate the knowledge to learn the difference
between the real and the unreal. To emphasise that, he concludes
that all knowledge other than the Self-Knowledge is useless,
Shankara makes the person realize how foolish he/she is in the
conduct and behaviour by these verses, and shows the purpose of
our worldly existence, which is to seek Govinda and attain Him.

Bhaja govindaM is divided into dvAdashamanjarikA stotram and
chaturdashamanjarika stotram. At the end of composing the first
stanza, it is said that Shankara burst forth with the next 12
stanzas of bhaja govindam.  Thus stanzas 2-13 with 1st as refrain
are called dvAdashmanjarika stotram. Inspired by the extempore
recital by Shankara, each of his 14 disciples composed a verse and
the 14 verse compendium is called chaturdashamanjarika stotram.
(There are no evidences to prove the exact individual authorship
of these 14 verses, we have some traditional hearsay eviences as
attribution.) Shankara added the finishing touches by adding five
of his own stanzas at the last bringing the total to 31.
The combined 31 are also termed as mohamudgaraH by some.  The last two
verses in this version is not found in all editions.

Bhaja govindaM has been set to musical tones and sung as prayer
songs by children. It is divided into dvAdashamanjarikA and
charpaTapanjarikA for this purpose.  The former is a set of verses
(verses 2-13) while the rest of the verses form charpaTamanjarikA.
Anyone who listens to the music of Bhaja govindaM is attracted
to it. However, the significance of the text goes much deeper
and contains a well defined philosophy of attaining salvation.

Shankara's words seem to be quite piercing and seem to lack the
softness and tenderness often found in his other texts, thus
addressing directly.  The reason is that this was an extempore
recital to an old man. His words can be compared to a knife of a
surgeon. The surgeon's knife cruelly removes the tumour with much
pain, but removing the tumour ultimately restores good health in
the patient. So are Shankara's words, which pierce and point out
our ignorance. It is a knife into the heart of worldliness, and
by removing this tumour of ignorance, we can attain everlasting
bliss with the grace of Govinda.

May the AchAryA guide us from ignorance to truth. 

OM tat sat.


<h2 itemprop="headline">भज गोविन्दं</h2>

भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं
गोविन्दं भज मूढमते ।
सम्प्राप्ते सन्निहिते काले
नहि नहि रक्षति डुकृङ्करणे ॥ १॥ 

Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, worship Govinda, Oh fool !
Rules of grammar will not save you at the time of your death.

मूढ जहीहि धनागमतृष्णां
कुरु सद्बुद्धिं मनसि वितृष्णाम् ।
यल्लभसे निजकर्मोपात्तं
वित्तं तेन विनोदय चित्तम् ॥ २॥ 

Oh fool ! Give up your thirst to amass wealth, devote your
mind to thoughts to the Real. Be content with what comes
through actions already performed in the past.

नारीस्तनभरनाभीदेशं
दृष्ट्वा मा गा मोहावेशम् ।
एतन्मांसवसादिविकारं
मनसि विचिन्तय वारं वारम् ॥ ३॥ 

Do not get drowned in delusion by going wild with passions and
lust by seeing a woman's navel and chest. These are nothing but
a modification of flesh. Fail not to remember this again and
again in your mind.

नलिनीदलगतजलमतितरलं
तद्वज्जीवितमतिशयचपलम् ।
विद्धि व्याध्यभिमानग्रस्तं
लोकं शोकहतं च समस्तम् ॥ ४॥ 

The life of a person is as uncertain as rain drops trembling on a
lotus leaf. Know that the whole world remains a prey to
disease, ego and grief.

यावद्वित्तोपार्जनसक्त-
स्तावन्निजपरिवारो रक्तः ।
पश्चाज्जीवति जर्जरदेहे
वार्तां कोऽपि न पृच्छति गेहे ॥ ५॥ 

So long as a man is fit and able to support his family, see
what affection all those around him show. But no one at home
cares to even have a word with him when his body totters due to
old age.

यावत्पवनो निवसति देहे
तावत्पृच्छति कुशलं गेहे ।
गतवति वायौ देहापाये
भार्या बिभ्यति तस्मिन्काये ॥ ६॥ 

When one is alive, his family members enquire kindly about his
welfare. But when the soul departs from the body, even his wife
runs away in fear of the corpse.

बालस्तावत्क्रीडासक्तः
तरुणस्तावत्तरुणीसक्तः ।
वृद्धस्तावच्चिन्तासक्तः
परमे ब्रह्मणि कोऽपि न सक्तः ॥ ७॥  var   परे 

The childhood is lost by attachment to playfulness. Youth is
lost by attachment to woman. Old age passes away by thinking over
many things. But there is hardly anyone who wants to be lost in
parabrahman.

का ते कान्ता कस्ते पुत्रः
संसारोऽयमतीव विचित्रः ।
कस्य त्वं कः कुत आयात-
स्तत्त्वं चिन्तय तदिह भ्रातः ॥ ८॥ 

Who is your wife ? Who is your son ? Strange is this samsAra, 
the world. Of whom are you ? From where have you come ? 
Brother, ponder over these truths.

सत्सङ्गत्वे निस्सङ्गत्वं
निस्सङ्गत्वे निर्मोहत्वम् ।
निर्मोहत्वे निश्चलतत्त्वं
निश्चलतत्त्वे जीवन्मुक्तिः ॥ ९॥ 

From satsanga, company of good people, comes non-attachment,
from non-attachment comes freedom from delusion, which leads to 
self-settledness. From self-settledness comes JIvan muktI.

वयसि गते कः कामविकारः
शुष्के नीरे कः कासारः ।
क्षीणे वित्ते कः परिवारः
ज्ञाते तत्त्वे कः संसारः ॥ १०॥ 

What good is lust when youth has fled ?
What use is a lake which has no water ?
Where are the relatives when wealth is gone ?
Where is samsAra, the world,  when the Truth is known ?

मा कुरु धनजनयौवनगर्वं
हरति निमेषात्कालः सर्वम् ।
मायामयमिदमखिलं हित्वा  var  बुध्वा
ब्रह्मपदं त्वं प्रविश विदित्वा ॥ ११॥ 

Do not boast of wealth, friends, and youth. Each one of these
are destroyed within a minute by time. Free yourself from the
illusion of the world of Maya and attain the timeless Truth.

दिनयामिन्यौ सायं प्रातः
शिशिरवसन्तौ पुनरायातः ।
कालः क्रीडति गच्छत्यायु-
स्तदपि न मुञ्चत्याशावायुः ॥ १२॥ 

Daylight and darkness, dusk and dawn, winter and springtime
come and go. Time plays and life ebbs away. But the storm of
desire never leaves.

का ते कान्ता धनगतचिन्ता
वातुल किं तव नास्ति नियन्ता ।
त्रिजगति सज्जनसङ्गतिरेका
भवति भवार्णवतरणे नौका ॥ १३॥ 

Oh mad man ! Why this engrossment in thoughts of wealth ? Is
there no one to guide you ? There is only one thing in three
worlds that can save you from the ocean of samsAra, get into
the boat of satsanga, company of good people, quickly.

द्वादशमञ्जरिकाभिरशेषः
कथितो वैयाकरणस्यैषः ।
उपदेशोऽभूद्विद्यानिपुणैः
श्रीमच्छङ्करभगवच्छरणैः ॥ १३अ ॥ 

This bouquet of twelve verses (2-13) was imparted to a grammarian
by the all-knowing Shankara, adored as the bhagavadpada.

The following 14 form chaturdashama~njarikA.

Stanza below is attributed to padmapAda.

जटिलो मुण्डी लुञ्छितकेशः
काषायाम्बरबहुकृतवेषः ।
पश्यन्नपि च न पश्यति मूढो
ह्युदरनिमित्तं बहुकृतवेषः ॥ १४॥ 

There are many who go with matted locks, many who have clean
shaven heads, many whose hairs have been plucked out; some are
clothed in orange, yet others in various colours --- all just for
a livelihood. Seeing truth revealed before them, still the foolish
ones see it not.

Stanza attributed to toTakAchArya.

अङ्गं गलितं पलितं मुण्डं
दशनविहीनं जातं तुण्डम् ।
वृद्धो याति गृहीत्वा दण्डं
तदपि न मुञ्चत्याशापिण्डम् ॥ १५॥ 

Strength has left the old man's body; his head has become bald,
his gums toothless and leaning on crutches. Even then the
attachment is strong and he clings firmly to fruitless desires.

Stanza attributed to hastAmalaka.

अग्रे वह्निः पृष्ठे भानुः
रात्रौ चुबुकसमर्पितजानुः ।
करतलभिक्षस्तरुतलवास-
स्तदपि न मुञ्चत्याशापाशः ॥ १६॥ 

Behold there lies the man who sits warming up his body with the
fire in front and the sun at the back; at night he curls up the
body to keep out of the cold; he eats his beggar's food from
the bowl of his hand and sleeps beneath the tree. Still in his
heart, he is a wretched puppet at the hands of passions.

Stanza attributed to Subodha.

कुरुते गङ्गासागरगमनं
व्रतपरिपालनमथवा दानम् ।
ज्ञानविहीनः सर्वमतेन
मुक्तिं न भजति जन्मशतेन ॥ १७॥  var  भजति न मुक्तिं 

One may go to Gangasagar, observe fasts, and give away riches
in charity ! Yet, devoid of jnana, nothing can give mukti even
at the end of a hundred births.

Stanza attributed to vArttikakAra (sureshvara).

सुरमंदिरतरुमूलनिवासः
शय्या भूतलमजिनं वासः ।
सर्वपरिग्रहभोगत्यागः
कस्य सुखं न करोति विरागः ॥ १८॥ 

Take your residence in a temple or below a tree, wear the
deerskin for the dress, and sleep with mother earth as your
bed. Give up all attachments and renounce all comforts. Blessed
with such vairgya, could any fail to be content ?

Stanza attributed to nityAnanda.

योगरतो वा भोगरतो वा
सङ्गरतो वा सङ्गविहीनः ।
यस्य ब्रह्मणि रमते चित्तं
नन्दति नन्दति नन्दत्येव ॥ १९॥ 

One may take delight in yoga or bhoga, may have attachment or
detachment. But only he whose mind steadily delights in Brahman
enjoys bliss, no one else.  

Stanza attributed to Anandagiri.

भगवद्गीता किञ्चिदधीता
गङ्गाजललवकणिका पीता ।
सकृदपि येन मुरारिसमर्चा
क्रियते तस्य यमेन न चर्चा ॥ २०॥ 

Let a man read but a little from bhagavadgItA, drink just a drop
of water from the Ganges, worship but once murAri. He then will
have no altercation with Yama.

Stanza attributed to dRiDhabhakti.

पुनरपि जननं पुनरपि मरणं
पुनरपि जननीजठरे शयनम् ।
इह संसारे बहुदुस्तारे
कृपयाऽपारे पाहि मुरारे ॥ २१॥ 

Born again, death again, again to stay in the mother's womb !
It is indeed hard to cross this boundless ocean of samsAra. Oh
Murari ! Redeem me through Thy mercy.

Stanza attributed to nityanAtha.

रथ्याचर्पटविरचितकन्थः
पुण्यापुण्यविवर्जितपन्थः ।
योगी योगनियोजितचित्तो
रमते बालोन्मत्तवदेव ॥ २२॥ 

There is no shortage of clothing for a monk so long as there are
rags cast off the road. Freed from vices and virtues, onward he
wanders. One who lives in communion with god enjoys bliss, pure
and uncontaminated, like a child and as an intoxicated.

Stanza attributed to yogAnanda.

कस्त्वं कोऽहं कुत आयातः
का मे जननी को मे तातः ।
इति परिभावय सर्वमसारम्
विश्वं त्यक्त्वा स्वप्नविचारम् ॥ २३॥ 

Who are you ? Who am I ? From where do I come ? Who is my mother,
who is my father ? Ponder thus, look at everything as essence-less
and give up the world as an idle dream.

Stanza attributed to surendra.

त्वयि मयि चान्यत्रैको विष्णु-
र्व्यर्थं कुप्यसि मय्यसहिष्णुः ।
भव समचित्तः सर्वत्र त्वं
वाञ्छस्यचिराद्यदि विष्णुत्वम् ॥ २४॥ 

In me, in you and in everything, none but the same Vishnu
dwells. Your anger and impatience is meaningless. If you wish to
attain the status of Vishnu, have samabhAva, equanimity, always.

Stanza attributed to medhAtithira.

शत्रौ मित्रे पुत्रे बन्धौ
मा कुरु यत्नं विग्रहसन्धौ ।
सर्वस्मिन्नपि पश्यात्मानं
सर्वत्रोत्सृज भेदाज्ञानम् ॥ २५॥ 

Waste not your efforts to win the love of or to fight against friend
and foe, children and relatives. See yourself in everyone and give
up all feelings of duality completely.

Stanza attributed to bhArativamsha.

कामं क्रोधं लोभं मोहं
त्यक्त्वाऽऽत्मानं भावय कोऽहम् । var  पश्यति सोऽहम्
आत्मज्ञानविहीना मूढा-
स्ते पच्यन्ते नरकनिगूढाः ॥ २६॥ 

Give up lust, anger, infatuation, and greed. Ponder over your real
nature. Fools are they who are blind to the Self. Cast into hell,
they suffer there endlessly.

Stanza attributed to sumati.

गेयं गीतानामसहस्रं
ध्येयं श्रीपतिरूपमजस्रम् ।
नेयं सज्जनसङ्गे चित्तं
देयं दीनजनाय च वित्तम् ॥ २७॥ 

Regularly recite from the Gita, meditate on Vishnu in your
heart, and chant His thousand glories. Take delight to be with
the noble and the holy. Distribute your wealth in charity to
the poor and the needy.

Stanza attributed to sumati.

सुखतः क्रियते रामाभोगः
पश्चाद्धन्त शरीरे रोगः ।
यद्यपि लोके मरणं शरणं
तदपि न मुञ्चति पापाचरणम् ॥ २८॥ 

He who yields to lust for pleasure leaves his body a prey to
disease. Though death brings an end to everything, man does not
give-up the sinful path.

अर्थमनर्थं भावय नित्यं
नास्तिततः सुखलेशः सत्यम् ।
पुत्रादपि धनभाजां भीतिः
सर्वत्रैषा विहिता रीतिः ॥ २९॥ 

Wealth is not welfare, truly there is no joy in it. Reflect
thus at all times. A rich man fears even his own son. This is
the way of wealth everywhere.

प्राणायामं प्रत्याहारं
नित्यानित्य विवेकविचारम् ।
जाप्यसमेतसमाधिविधानं
कुर्ववधानं महदवधानम् ॥ ३०॥ 

Regulate the prANa-s, life forces, remain unaffected by external 
influences and discriminate between the real and the fleeting. 
Chant the holy name of God and silence the turbulent mind. 
Perform these with care, with extreme care.

गुरुचरणाम्बुजनिर्भरभक्तः
संसारादचिराद्भव मुक्तः ।
सेन्द्रियमानसनियमादेवं
द्रक्ष्यसि निजहृदयस्थं देवम् ॥ ३१॥ 

Oh devotee of the lotus feet of the Guru ! May thou be soon
free from Samsara. Through disciplined senses and controlled
mind, thou shalt come to experience the indwelling Lord of your
heart !

The following two are not found in standard text of Bhajagovindam.

मूढः कश्चन वैयाकरणो
डुःकृङ्करणाध्ययनधुरीणः ।
श्रीमच्छङ्करभगवच्छिष्यै-
र्बोधित आसीच्छोधितकरणः ॥ ३२॥ 

Thus a silly grammarian lost in rules cleansed of his narrow
vision and shown the Light by Shankara's apostles.

भज गोविन्दं भज गोविन्दं
गोविन्दं भज मूढमते ।
नामस्मरणादन्यमुपायं
नहि पश्यामो भवाब्धितरणे ॥ ३३॥ भवतरणे 

Worship Govinda, worship Govinda, worship Govinda, Oh fool !
Other than chanting the Lord's names, there is no other way
to cross the life's ocean.
