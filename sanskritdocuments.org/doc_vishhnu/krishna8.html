<h2 itemprop="name"> श्रीकृष्णाष्टकं श्रीकृष्णताण्डवस्तोत्रं च </h2>
          श्री कृश्न जन्माष्टमी
  नित्यानन्दैकरसं सच्चिन्मात्रं स्वयञ्ज्योतिः ।
  पुरुषोत्तममजमीशं वन्दे श्रीयादवाधीशम् ॥


  I adore Krishna, the Supreme Person, the Unborn
  Lord, the Self-effulgent One, the Supreme Lord of
  the descendents of Yadu, Whose nature is that of
  existence and consciousness, and Whose essence is
  entirely that of eternal bliss.
           From Prabodha sudhAkara of shrI shankarAchArya
  The birthday of shrI Krishna is usually taken to be the
  Shravana Krishna Ashtami, but is sometimes assigned to
  the month Bhadrapada, especially in Northern India.
  According to traditional sources, the Janmashtami is
  observed on the day when the ashtami tithi occurs at
  midnight . If the ashtami tithi AND the Rohini nakShatra
  occur on the same day, then the observance is considered
  to be doubly sacred; otherwise the observance is held on
  the day on which the ashtami prevails at midnight.
  The vrata mainly consists of fasting, spending the whole
  night in the worship of Krishna, reciting hymns of praise and
  Krishna's pastimes, reciting prayers from the Bhagavata,
  offering arghya to Krishna, and the parana or the ceremonial
  breaking of the fast .  The next day is  celebrated as
  Krishna Jayanti.
  Celebrations are held on a grand scale in all Krishna
  temples,  especially the ones in Vrindavan, Mathura
  (Uttar Pradesh), Dvaraka (Gujarat), and other regionally
  famous temples.
  Although, the great Vedantin Adi shankara preached the
  path of knowledge (Jnana), fiercely criticizing and
  routing various schools of philosophy, he did not decry
  the path of devotion (Bhakti). On the contrary, one is able
  to discern from his writings that he had a soft-corner
  for Bhakti . shankara did not only believe in the efficacy of
  Bhakti in the realization of Brahman, but he also actually
  composed many stotras or hymns in praise of Vishnu, Shiva,
  Devi, Ganapati, Skanda, etc.
  One such hymn is the shrI Krishna Ashtaka or eight verses in
  praise of shrI Krishna . This stotra, like many of shankara's
  stotras, has a musical effect and may be easily set to
  music . It is, therefore, recommended that the stotra be
  sung, not just recited .  For Lord Vishnu has promised to
  be present wherever His devotees sing His glories.

  यत्र गायन्ति मद्भक्ताः तत्र तिष्ठामि नारद ।

<h2 itemprop="headline">श्री कृष्णाष्टकम्</h2>
  भजे व्रजैकमण्डनं समस्तपापखण्डनं
  स्वभक्तचित्तरंजनं सदैव नन्दनन्दनम् ।
  सुपिच्छगुच्छमस्तकं सुनादवेणुहस्तकं
  अनंगरंगसागरं नमामि कृष्णनागरम् ॥ १॥


  I worship the naughty Krishna, the sole ornament of Vraja,
  Who destroys all the sins (of His devotees),
  Who delights the minds of His devotees, the joy of Nanda,
  Whose head is adorned with   peacock feathers, Who holds
  a sweet-sounding flute in His hand, and Who is the ocean of
  the art of love.

  मनोजगर्वमोचनं विशाललोललोचनं
  विधूतगोपशोचनं नमामि पद्मलोचनम् ।
  करारविन्दभूधरं स्मितावलोकसुन्दरं
  महेन्द्रमानदारणं नमामि कृष्णावारणम् ॥ २॥


  I bow to Krishna Who rid Kama deva of his pride, Who has
  beautiful, large eyes, Who takes away the sorrows of the
  Gopas (cowherds), the lotus-eyed One . I bow to Krishna
  Who lifted the (Govardhana) hill with His hand, Whose
  smile and glance are extremely attractive, Who destroyed
  the pride of Indra, and Who is like the King of elephants.

  कदम्बसूनकुण्डलं सुचारुगण्डमण्डलं
  व्रजांगनैकवल्लभं नमामि कृष्णदुर्लभम् ।
  यशोदया समोदया सगोपया सनन्दया
  युतं सुखैकदायकं नमामि गोपनायकम् ॥ ३॥


  I bow to that Krishna Who wears earrings made of Kadamba
  flowers, Who has beautiful cheeks, Who is the only darling
  of the Gopikas of Vraja, and Who is very difficult to attain
  (by any means other than Bhakti). I bow to Krishna Who is
  accompanied by Gopas (cowherds), Nanda, and an overjoyed
  Yashoda,Who gives (His devotees) nothing but happiness, and
  Who is the Lord of the Gopas.

  सदैव पादपंकजं मदीय मानसे निजं
  दधानमुक्तमालकं नमामि नन्दबालकम् ।
  समस्तदोषशोषणं समस्तलोकपोषणं
  समस्तगोपमानसं नमामि नन्दलालसम् ॥ ४॥


  I bow to the son of Nanda, Who has placed His lotus feet
  in my mind and Who has beautiful curls of hair . I adore
  Krishna Who removes all defects, Who nourishes all the
  worlds and Who is desired by all the Gopas and Nanda.

  भुवो भरावतारकं भवाब्धिकर्णधारकं
  यशोमतीकिशोरकं नमामि चित्तचोरकम् ।
  दृगन्तकान्तभंगिनं सदा सदालिसंगिनं
  दिने दिने नवं नवं नमामि नन्दसम्भवम् ॥ ५॥


   I bow to Krishna Who relieves the burden of the earth
  (by vanquishing innumerable demons and other evil forces),
  Who helps us cross the ocean of miseries, Who is the son
  of Yasoda, and Who steals the hearts of everyone . I bow to
  Nanda's son Who has extremely attractive eyes, Who is always
  accompanied by saintly devotees, and Whose (pastimes and form)
  appear newer and newer, day by day.

  गुणाकरं सुखाकरं कृपाकरं कृपापरं
  सुरद्विषन्निकन्दनं नमामि गोपनन्दनम् ।
  नवीनगोपनागरं नवीनकेलिलम्पटं
  नमामि मेघसुन्दरं तडित्प्रभालसत्पटम् ॥ ६॥


  Krishna is the repository of all good qualities, all
  happiness, and grace . He destroys the enemies of the gods
  and delights the Gopas . I bow to the mischievous cowherd
  Krishna, Who is attached to His exploits, which (appear)
  new (every day), Who has the handsome complexion of a
  dark cloud, and  Who wears a yellow garment (pItAmbara)
  that shines likes lightning.

  समस्तगोपनन्दनं हृदम्बुजैकमोदनं
  नमामि कुंजमध्यगं प्रसन्नभानुशोभनम् ।
  निकामकामदायकं दृगन्तचारुसायकं
  रसालवेणुगायकं नमामि कुंजनायकम् ॥ ७॥


  Krishna delights all the Gopas and (plays with them)
  in the center of the grove (kunja). He is appears as
  resplendent and pleasing as the sun and causes the
  lotus that is the heart (of the devotee) to blossom
  with joy . I bow to that Lord of the grove of creepers
  Who completely fulfills the desires (of the devotees),
  Whose beautiful glances are like arrows, and Who plays
  melodious tunes on the flute.

  विदग्धगोपिकामनोमनोज्ञतल्पशायिनं
  नमामि कुंजकानने प्रव्रद्धवन्हिपायिनम् ।
  किशोरकान्तिरंजितं दृअगंजनं सुशोभितं
  गजेन्द्रमोक्षकारिणं नमामि श्रीविहारिणम् ॥ ८॥


  Krishna lies down on the bed that is the minds of the
  intelligent Gopis who always think of Him . I adore Him
  Who drank the spreading forest-fire (in order to
  protect the cowherd community). I bow to Krishna Who has
  eyes which are made attractive by His boyhood charm and
  a black unguent (anjan), Who liberated the elephant
  Gajendra (from the jaws of the crocodile), and Who is the
  consort of LakShmi (shrI).

  यदा तदा यथा तथा तथैव कृष्णसत्कथा
  मया सदैव गीयतां तथा कृपा विधीयताम् ।
  प्रमाणिकाष्टकद्वयं जपत्यधीत्य यः पुमान
  भवेत्स नन्दनन्दने भवे भवे सुभक्तिमान ॥ ९॥


  O Lord Krishna! Please bless me so that I may sing your
  glories and pastimes, regardless of the position I am in.
  Anyone who studies or recites these two authoritative ashtakas
  will be blessed with devotion to Krishna in every rebirth.
  Note: The two ashtakas referred to above are the shrI Krishna
  Ashtaka and the Krishna Ashtaka.

इति श्रीमच्छंकराचार्यकृतं श्रीकृष्णाष्टकं 
कृष्णकृपाकटाक्षस्तोत्रं च सम्पूर्णम् ॥

            श्री कृष्णार्पणमस्तु ॥
