no other Lord but Himself. 

 Notes:  
1. shiva and mahesha are the names of Lord Shiva also.
Sri Shankara states that shiva and viShNu are one and
the same. The purANic shloka 
शिवाय विष्णुरूपाय शिवरूपाय विष्णवे ।
शिवस्य हृदयम् विश्णु विष्णोश्च हृदयम् शिवः ॥

 and so on also asserts the same. 

 2. Lord RAma ruled Ayodhya for 11,000 years according
to the Ramayana. Even today a model state is referred to
as a 'rAmarAjya'. 

 3. This reminds me of a nindA-stuthi in Kannada by
Sri PurandaradAsa. He says 'ninnantha swAmi enaguNTu
ninagilla' meaning 'I have a master and Lord like You.
You have no master like Yourself'. 

यदावर्णयत्कर्णमूलेऽन्तकाले
      शिवो राम रामेति रामेति काश्याम् ।
तदेकं परं तारकब्रह्मरूपं
       भजेऽहं भजेऽहं भजेऽहं भजेऽहम् ॥ ३ ॥

यत्  = That (which) 
काश्याम्  = in kAshi (vArANasi), 
अन्तकाले  = at the time of Death,

एकम्  = Undivided, 
परम्  = the greatest 
तारकब्रह्मरूपम्  = of the form of tArakabrahma
(rescuing devotees from the ocean of samsAra (the ephemeral world)) 
भजेऽहं  = I adore (worship) 

 I adore shrI rAma ,the Unity, the greatest one,
whose name is uttered in the ears of the blessed
devotees in KAshi at the time of Death by none other
than Lord Shiva Himself. This form/name of the Lord
(tArakabrahma) is capable of rescuing devotees from
the ocean of samsAra. 

 Note:  
It is a well known belief that Lord Shiva utters rAma
nAma in the ears of dying devotees in kAshi, on the
banks of the Holy Ganga, thereby granting them mokSha.

Lord Shiva is known for His Love of rAma nAma.
In the phala shruthi of the Sri ViShNu sahasranAma,
He answers Goddess Parvathi's question as to how the
names of Lord ViShNu are remembered by learned ones as 
 श्रीरामरामरामेति रमे रामे मनोरमे ।
 सहस्रनाम तत्तुल्यं राम नाम वरानने ॥

 The thousand names of Lord ViShNu are equivalent to
one rAma nAma recited as ᳚shrI rAma rAma ...᳚. 

महारत्नपीठे शुभे कल्पमूले
      सुखासीनमादित्यकोटिप्रकाशम् ।

                  (the celestial wish-fulfilling tree)

                       millions of Suns,

                     jAnakI (sIta) and lakShmaNa, 
एकं  =         one without a second, 
सदा  =         Always, 
रामचन्द्रम्  = Sri RAmachandra (His face compared
                to  the poetically cool moon), 
भजेऽहं  =   I worship. 

 I worship shrI rAmachandra, who is seated
comfortably on a great gem-studded throne under
the most auspicious kalpavrikSha. He shines with the
effulgence of millions of Suns, ever accompanied by
His consort sIta and brother lakShmaNa. I forever
adore shrI rAma who is One without a second
(ekamevAdvitIya).

This is a beautiful dhyAna shloka of the Lord.

This verse followed by the next two describe a
beautiful scenario in which shrI rAma's magnificence
is described. It is a pity that translations cannot
bring out the hidden beauty of the original
language. 

क्वणद्रत्नमञ्जीरपादारविन्दम्
      लसन्मेखलाचारुपीताम्बराढ्यम् ।
महारत्नहारोल्लसत्कौस्तुभाङ्गं
      नदच्चंचरीमंजरीलोलमालम् ॥ ५ ॥

पादारविन्दम्  = the Lotus feet of the Lord, 
क्वणद्-रत्न-मञ्जीर  = adorned by sweet jingling
               precious-stone studded anklets, 
लसन्-मेखला  =    with a glittering waistband, 
चारु पीताम्बराढ्यम्  = wearing a beautiful yellow
                         garment, 
महारत्नहारोल्लसत्  = brilliant with a great
                gem-studded necklace, 
कौस्तुभान्गम्  = with the most auspicious kaustubha
 gem on His chest, 
नदच्-चंचरी-मंजरी-लोलमालम्  = adorned with
                flower garlands with bees buzzing
                 around the flowers 

 shrI rAma's lotus feet are adorned by sweetly
jingling gem-studded anklets. He is wearing a
beautiful yellow garment with a glittering waistband.
He wears a resplendent gem necklace with the Kaustubha
gem on His chest. A garland with black bees buzzing
around the flowers bedecks the Lord.

The Kaustubha was one of the gems obtained during the
churning of the milk ocean.pItAmbara is also used as
a name for the Lord (one wearing the pItAmbara). 

लसच्चन्द्रिकास्मेरशोणाधराभम्
      समुद्यत्पतङ्गेन्दुकोटिप्रकाशम् ।
नमद्ब्रह्मरुद्रादिकोटीररत्न-
       स्फुरत्कान्तिनीराजनाराधितान्घ्रिम् ॥ ६ ॥

लसच्-चन्द्रिका-स्मेर-शोणा-अधराभम्  =
              With a smile like shining moonlight
              playing on the beautiful red lips, 
समुद्यत्-पतङ्ग-इन्दु-कोटिप्रकाशम्  =
              With a brilliance unmatched by
              millions of rising Suns and Moons, 
आराधितान्घ्रिम्  =
              With feet worshipped by, 
स्फुरत्-कान्ति-नीराजन  =
              the Arati (nIrAjana) in the form of
              radiating lustre, 
नमद्-ब्रह्म-रुद्रादि-कोटीररत्न  =
              from the millions of gems adorning the
              crowns of the prostrating brahma,
              rudra and other gods. 

 A moonlight-like shining smile plays on the beautiful
crimson lips of the Lord. His brilliance is unmatched
even by millions of rising Suns and Moons. His feet
are worshipped by the Arati of the radiating lustre
from the millions of gems adorning the crowns
of the prostrating brahma,rudra and other gods.

shrI rAma is the paranjyoti, the Supreme
Illuminator,who is beyond every other
light including the Sun and the Moon !
This reminds me of the Geeta shloka 15-6
'na tadbhAsayate sUryo na shashA~Nkona pAvakaH .'
and so on and similar mantras from the katha and
muNDaka upanishads which state 'neither the sun nor
the moon nor the fire light It (the abode of the
Lord)'.

The scenario of the nIrAjana from the crowns of
prostrating gods is seen even in the shivanandalaharI
stotra of shrI shankara (verse 65). 
'कोटीरोज्ज्वल-रत्न-दीपकलिका-नीराजनम्
कुर्वते'।

 The same has been used in shrI tyAgaraja's famous
krithi 'shambho mahAdeva'. 'sura-vrinda-kirITa-maNI-
vara-nIrajita-pada'. shrI tyAgarAja,one of the
Trinity of Carnatic music, was one of the greatest
composer-musicians of South Indian music. 

पुरः प्राञ्जलीनाञ्जनेयादिभक्तान्
       स्वचिन्मुद्रया भद्रया बोधयन्तम् ।
भजेऽहं भजेऽहं सदा रामचन्द्रं
       त्वदन्यं न मन्ये न मन्ये न मन्ये ॥ ७ ॥

                     chinmudra (jnAna mudra),

रामचन्द्रं  = shrI rAmachandra, 
सदा  = always,

 shrI rAma is teaching brahmavidyA with the
chinmudra to shrI A~njaneya and other devotees who are
standing with folded hands. I worship Him again and again. O
RAma, I will not even think of anybody else (or any
other god/deity).

Let us meditate on this Divine Scene again.

shrI rAma is clad in Royal attire, with the
legendary Koustubha gem on His chest. He wears a floral
garland with the bees buzzing in confusion around the Lord
and the flowers. A beautiful moonlight like smile is
playing on His crimson red lips. Brahma, Rudra and
other gods offer their obeisances at the feet of the
Lord with the lustre radiating from their crown-jewels.
A~njaneya and other devotees stand respectfully in
front of the Lord. shrI rAmachandra is imparting
brahma-vidyA to all the devotees with the most
auspicious chinmudra. O shrI rAma, I worship Thee
again and again. I will not even bring other thoughts
or gods to my mind.

The chinmudra or the jnAna mudra is a posture with
the right index finger and the right thumb touching one
another. All great Gurus are seen with the chinmudra.
It usually indicates imparting brahma-vidya.
shrI dakShiNAmUrti, shrI shAradAmba
and shrI sha~Nkara are most well known for their
display of the chin-mudra.

The situation of shrI rAma imparting brahma-vidyA
is reminiscent of shrI dakShiNAmUrti, a
jnAna-avatAra of Lord shiva. A beautiful dhyAna shloka of
shrI dakShiNAmUrti is worth mentioning here. 

मोउन-व्याख्यान-प्रकटित-परब्रह्मतत्त्वं युवानम् ।
वर्षिष्ठ-अन्तेवसद्-ऋषि-गणैरावृतं ब्रह्म-निष्ठैः ॥

आचार्येन्द्रं करकलित-चिन्मुद्र-मानन्दरूपम्
स्वात्मारामं मुदितवदनं दक्षिणामूर्तिमीडे ॥

shrI dakShiNAmUrti teaches brahma-vidyA with his
silent instruction. While the Teacher is a youth, He
is surrounded by numerous sages and brahman-realized
souls. He is the best among the AchArya s.His hand
displays the chinmudra. He is the embodiment of bliss
and is always happy within Himself. I bow to shrI
dakShiNAmUrti with the pleasant look on His face.

यदा मत्समीपं कृतान्तः समेत्य
      प्रचण्डप्रतापैर्भटैर्भीषयेन्माम् ।
तदाविष्करोषि त्वदीयं स्वरूपं
      तदापत्प्रणाशं सकोदण्डबाणम् ॥ ८ ॥

कृतान्तः  = Lord Yama, 
समेत्य  = approaches, 
प्रचण्ड-प्रतापैर्-भटैर्  = with his attendants of
                               ferocious valour, 
भीषयेन्-माम्  = frightening me, 
तदा-अविष्करोषि  = then you display, 
त्वदीयं स्वरूपं  = your own form (as shrI rAma) 
तद्-आपत्-प्रणाशं  = capable of destroying dangers, 
सकोदण्डबाणम्  = with your famous kodaNDa bow and
                  quiver of arrows. 

 O shrI rAma! At the time of death, Lord Yama
approaches me with his ferocious attendants,
frightening me. Then You display your form with
the kodaNDa bow and arrow, which is capable of
destroying all miseries.

shrI rAma is known as kodaNDa-pANi, the one holding
the kodaNDa bow. This bow was given by shrI agastya
to shrI rAma during His exile in the daNDaka forest.

The story of ajAmiLa in the shrImad-bhAgavata is
brought to mind by this shloka. 

निजे मानसे मन्दिरे संनिधेहि

      प्रशाधि प्रशाधि प्रकाशं प्रभो माम्
                                              ॥ १० ॥

 O rAma, with Your foremost devotees the

devotees, be pleased towards me, Your devotee.
Many salutations to You, O Lord ! Guide me,Your
disciple, towards knowledge.

The word shAdhi is seen in the bhagavadgItA (II-7),
when arjuna asks shrI kRiShNa to 'shAdhi mAm tvAm
prapannam', that is, to instruct arjuna who had taken
refuge in Lord kRiShNa.

Is knowledge a right interpretation of the word
'prakAsha' ? 

त्वमेवासि दैवं परं मे यदेकं
      सुचैतन्यमेतत्त्वदन्यं न मन्ये ।

of the Universe. I do not regard anybody other than
You as God.

Though brahman does not physically create the five
elements, it is in brahman that the entire creation is
seen. Brahman, being knowledge Itself, is the
comprehensor and the comprehended. Brahman has been
described in the shrI lalitA sahasranAma as
'j~nAna-j~nAtRi-j~neya-rUpA', of the form of
knowledge, the knower and the known.

नमो विश्वपित्रे  =
        Salutations to the Father of the Universe,

 Salutations to the Creator of the Universe.

Salutations to the Measurer of the Universe.
Salutations to the Guide (Caretaker) of the Universe.
Salutations to the Conqueror of the Universe.
Salutations to the Father of the Universe.
Salutations to the Mother of the Universe.

As Lord brahma and Lord rudra, He is the creator
and the Destroyer of the Universe. Since He is the
purusha, He is the Enjoyer of prakRiti.

shrImannArAyaNa in His trivikrama avatAra measured
the entire Universe in three footsteps. So He is
referred to as the measurer. He is described in the
puruSha sUkta  as having 'atyatiSThaddashA~Ngulam',
exceeded the universe,always by 10 finger-widths,
meaning that He is infinite. How can He not be able to
measure the Universe ?!

He is the netRi or the Leader of the universe. As the
trimurti aspect of lord viShNu, He is the Preserver of
the Universe.

He has conquered the entire Universe. When He is all,
there is no surprise in His winning the Universe.

Finally He is the Supreme Father and Supreme Mother.

      प्रसादाद्धि चैतन्यमाधत्त राम ।

 O shrI rAma, even a lifeless rock obtained vitality
by the contact with the dust of your Holy Feet. It is
no surprise,then, if an intelligent human being
attains Supreme Consciousness by the dedicated service
of Your Lotus Feet.

shrI sha~Nkara is referring to the story of satI
ahalyA in the rAmAyaNa. ahalyA was cursed by her
husband Sage goutama to become a rock. When shrI
rAma touched that rock with His feet, the rock came
back to life. That, is the power of the Divine Feet of
the Lord. 

पवित्रं चरित्रं विचित्रं त्वदीयं

 O shrI rAmachandra, those beings who constantly
remember Your Holy and wonderful deeds, obtain You,
who are the destroyer of the samsAra-miseries and the

Support of the Universe. As a result, during their
final moments, they do not have the fearsome
sight of Yama and his attendants.

When one is devoted to the Divine Pastimes of the Lord,
where will he/she have the time to think of such
trifles as Death ? The Lord takes care of His devotees
always. As He has promised all His devotees in the
gItA (9:22) : 
'अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते ।
 तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ॥'

स पुण्यः स गण्यः शरण्यो ममायं
      नरो वेद यो देवचूडामणिं त्वाम् ।
सदाकारमेकं चिदानन्दरूपं
      मनोवागगम्यं परन्धाम राम ॥ १८ ॥

परन्धाम  = the supreme destination (or the abode of mokSha) (as) 
मम अयम्  = he is my 
शरण्यो  = Refuge 

 O Lord rAma, You are the supreme destination. The devotee
who considers You, who are  of the form of sat, chit and Ananda,
who are the best among the devas, and who are beyond mind and
speech, as his Refuge, is indeed the most fortunate. He is
indeed worthy of respect.

It can also be read as :  
That being who 'knows' or 'has attained' You is indeed the
most fortunate and is worthy of respect. He is indeed my Refuge.

In the book I am referring to, the second line of the shloka
has been printed as  'नरो वेद ये देवचूडामणिं ताम्'।
 But when I read the Kannada translation, it was different.
Assuming a printing error in the shloka rather than in the
translation, I corrected the shloka to go with the translation.

Your childhood itself !

The bow of Lord shiva was worshipped by King Janaka, father
of sItA mAtA. During the svayamvara of sItA-mAtA, when
all others struggled to even lift that bow, Lord rAma, while
attempting to string the bow, broke it. 

दशग्रीवमुग्रं सपुत्रं समित्रं
       सरिद्दुर्गमध्यस्थरक्षोगणेशम् ।

in the strong fortress protected by the ocean. He had able support in
his powerful sons and friends.O rAma, by which other brave one, be it
a man, a deva or an asura, could such an enemy, be defeated ?

The awesome battle-prowess of shrI rAma is praised here.

O rAma, I, within my heart, worship Your foremost devotee with devotion,
who constantly prostrates before You.

shrI Anjaneya is the foremost devotee of shrI rAma. During the pUjA of Lord
Rama, the Lord is always referred to as sItA-lakShmaNa-bharata-shatRighna-
hanUmat-sameta-shrI-rAmachandra. shrI Hanuman is considered to be an amsha
of vAyu, the wind god, as also of Lord Shiva. There is a very nice shloka
about Hanuman's devotion to rAma. 

यत्र यत्र रघुनाथकीर्तनं
      तत्र तत्र कृत-मस्तकाञ्जलिम् ।
बाष्पवारिपरिपूर्ण-लोचनं
      मारुतिम् नमत राक्षसान्तकम् ॥

 Wherever the Lord rAma is sung of, in all those places,
mAruti is always present with head bent in reverence and
folded hands, with eyes full of tears welled up from devotion.
Salutations to such a mAruti, who is the destroyer of the rAkShasas.

by the Bow, who are not revered by LakShmaNa or Shatrughna, who are not
of terrific valor, who are not capable of killing the Lord of Lanka,
who are not friends of SugrIva and who do not have the name of rAma.
Enough of all such gods. shrI rAma alone is enough for us.

Or:  
None else has sItA for a consort,
Many are those gods who are unadorned by the Bow.
Numerous are these devas who are not revered by the son of sumitrA.
The thousands of celestials do not have that terrific valor.
The millions of surAs were unable to even defeat the Lord of Lanka.
They are not friends with sugrIva and most importantly are not known by
the Holy name of rAma ! Enough of all these gods !

shrI rAma alone is worshipful, so where is the need for other gods ?
It is difficult to translate such a beautiful piece to English. The
translation is dull compared to the original. In a negative manner, shrI
rAma's great qualities are described here. 

अवीरासनस्थैरचिन्मुद्रिकाढ्यै-
        रभक्ताञ्जनेयादितत्त्वप्रकाशैः ।

is seated comfortably in the vIrAsana posture under the mandAra tree,
and with his right hand in the chinmudrA pose, expounds the Supreme Truth
to AnjanEya and other devotees. No other deity can be so. Enough of other
deities other than Lord rAma.

Just by worshipping Lord rAma, who has all these wondrous qualities,
can one attain the Absolute. Why then, does one need other deities?

अरामाभिदेयैः  = by them who are not known as rAma, 

देवतैः  = by such deities,

 Lord rAma made the ocean the target of His anger. He can be
worshipped for just his valor only. He traveled in the daNDaka
forest on exile, due to His other relatives (with His relatives).
He bears a smile and revives people from the defects of birth and death,
Lord rAma alone can be worshipped by us. We do not need the other gods.

During the bridge-building to Lanka, Lord rAma got angry with the
ocean for not allowing the building work to proceed. That is described
here. His valor needs no introduction.
