granaries in the land may be expected to be filled in course of time.

350।    अविवाहन्यायः
The maxim of widow marriage. 
This maxim is used to denote an impossible and ludicrous attempt; as,
acccording to the scriptures of the Hindus a woman can marry only once. The

Hindus, and is therefore quite impossible on the part of a Hindu lady.

351।    शक्तिसहकरिनति न्यायः

to the other on the part of a dead body is quite impossible.

355।    शाखाचन्द्रन्यायः
The maxim of the bough and the moon. 
As the moon, though considerably distant from the bough of a tree, is spoken of

358।    शिरोवेष्टनेन णासिकास्पर्शन्यायः
The maxim of touching the nose in binding a piece of cloth round the head. 
This maxim is used to denote any uncalled for and quite irrelevant thing; just
as touching the nose and binding a piece of cloth round the head are quite
unconnected and have no relation to each other.

359।    शिष्यस्वातन्त्र्यन्यायः
The maxim of an independent disciple. 
A disciple can make no advance in spiritual life, should he differ from his
spiritual guide (Gurudeva in judgment and conduct). So this maxim is used to

360।    शूर्पन्यायः
The maxim of winnowing fan.

keeping the kernel and rejecting the husk, just as it is done by a winnowing

361।    शैलूशन्यायः
The maxim of an actress on the stage. 
In a theatre the self-same actress makes her appereance on the stage in
different sorts of dress and guise on different occasions, but none of these
has any concern with her real form, so this maxim is used to denote the
delusiveness of the world.

362।    श्यालशुनकन्यायः
The maxim of a dog, the wife's brother. 
It takes its origin from a story that a man called his dog to be his brother
in-law (wife's brother), and called it names often times only with a view to
try the patience of his wife, who would fly into rage at this conduct of the
husband; and it is used to denote an unbecoming conduct of a person towards
anyone among his friends and relatives.

363।    श्वपुच्छौन्नामनन्यायः

try for the purpose.

364।    शौर्यहीनक्षत्रियन्यायः
The maxim of a Kshatriya without prowess.

belonging to the warrior class, without bravery, is considered to be a disgrace
of his race.

365।    स्वसृनिर्गच्छोक्ति न्यायः

The maxim of Mother-in-law, go out

No lady has any right to turn her mother-in-law out of doors, as the
mother-in-law has the same right to occupy the house as she has; so this maxim
is used to denote improper exercise of one's power.

366।    स्वकर्तव्यमघकुर्विति न्यायः
The maxim of ?Do to-day what you have to do to-morrow᳚. 
This maxim is used to denote that it is proper to make use of the earliest

367।    षड्दर्शनन्यायः
The maxim of the six schools of philosophy. 
It is used to mean that the atheistic schools of philosophy being six, the
teistic or the Vaidic philosophies are also regarded as being divided into six
schools, while in fact the philosophies are of seven schools according to the
seven planes of j~nAna or knowledge.

368।    सङ्करपितृन्यायः
The maxim of the intermixed parents. 
This maxim is used to denote an impossible exception. The wishes of the issues
of the intermixed parents of presenting libations of water to the names of the
deceased ancestors, cannot be realised, as their offerings are not acceptable
to Aryama and other pitars.

369।    सच्छिद्रघटंवुन्यायः
The maxim of a water-vessel with holes in it. 
A water-vessel, even if filled to the brim, becomes soon emptied of all water,

efforts on the part of an instructor to help a pupil who is naturally
defective, to grow in knowledge and character.

370।    सन्दिग्धप्रयोजनञ्चविचारमर्हतति न्यायः

and minutely in all its bearings.

371।    समुद्रवृष्टिन्यायः

373।    सर्वविशेषणंशवधारणमिति न्यायः

modify. It is used to denote that nature and character of a great person may be
understood from those of his attendants and followers.

374।    सर्वसग्वप्रत्ययन्यायः
The maxim of the things and their aim. 
As the Vedas have different branches but they all aim at the great one, so the
variety of things in creation have one and the same aim.

375।    सम्प्रदायकलहन्यायः

The maxim of the different systems of religious teaching and their
discordance.

Different systems of religious teaching quarell among themselves as regards the
details of their doctrine, but in reality they all inculcate the worship of the
One Being. So this maxim is used to denote the futility of such differences.

376।    साक्षात्प्रकृतविति न्यायः
The maxim of universal union in Nature. 
As an earthen vessel is finally reduced to earth of which it is made, so
everything in the universe will at last be dissolved into the Great First cause
from which they emanated.

377।    साधुमैत्रीन्यायः
The maxim of friendship of the good and the honest.

The maxim of applicability and non-aplicability. 
This maxim denotes that applicability is always more powerful than its
reverse.

379।    सहङ्कारज्ञानन्यायः

advisable.

380।    सिंहमृगन्यायः
The maxim of the lion and the deer.

whom is stronger than and is always bent upon doing harm to the other.

381।    सिंहमेषन्यायः
The maxim of the lion and the sheep.

village and mixed with a flock of lambs. It lived ther for some days, and then
when it was able to make sound peculiar to its own race or class, it did not
perceive it in its proper element. Afterwards a lion from the forest came there
and taught it what it was, whereupon it left the flock of the lambs and went to
the forest to join the company of lions there. The maxim denotes that under the
circumstances, one may for the time being in a position not to realise one's
true worth but at last when under instruction his eyes are opened he behaves in
a manner true to his self and nature.

The maxim originates from a story that a person got a son by propitiating a
certain god, and then again he worshipped and propitiated a different god for
another son. The result was that when the second son was born, the first one
breathed his last. It is intended therefore to teach that one should devote
himself to the worship of one and the same god or, oneness of aim and purpose
is indispensably necessary for success in life.

385।    सुभगभिक्षुकन्यायः
The maxim of an unlucky husband and a lucky wife. 
If a poor man can marry a wife who is a favourite of Fortune, he is also sure

woman plays an important part in the fortune of a man to make him prosperous in
life.

386।    सुन्दोपसुन्दन्यायः
The maxim of Sunda and Upasunda. 
The maxim originates from a Pauranic story that two daityas or demon

denotes that rivalry on accont of woman often proves to be cause of total
destruction.

387।    सूचिकटाहन्यायः
The maxim of the needle and the kettle.

thing.

The maxim takes its origin from the erroneous notion regarding the motion of
the sun who has, broadly speaking, no motion, but still erroneously beleived by

denote various sorts of erroneous notions that the human nature is subject to.

390।    सोपानारोहणन्यायः

going upstairs must proceed by passing the steps one after another.

The maxim of coming downstairs. 
Just as one coming down from the first floor or the second floor must have to
pass the steps in gradual succession, or there is every chance of suffering a

The maxim of the cooking pot and boiled rice.

still more his position already strong.

395।    स्थूलारुन्धतीन्यायः
The maxim of a huge thing and a tiny thing (like the star Arundhati). 
This maxim takes its origin from the custom of showing the star Arundhati to
the bride and the bridegroom at the close of the marriage ceremony. At that
time attention of both is first drawn to the moon, and from the moon to a big
star close by, and thus gradually to Arundhati, which is very tiny star. It

402।    स्वाङ्गं स्वव्यवधायकं न भवति न्यायः

and discretion enough to guide, help, and protect his followers, just as a
