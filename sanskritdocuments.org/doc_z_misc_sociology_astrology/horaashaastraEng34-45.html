  English translation
From Aswi is supposed to be derived carriages for animals for transport,
everything related to transport and transport department. The Puranas
relate that the two Aswini Kumaras were born of mother Sanga and father
Ravi. The mother held the solar semen in her nostrils, for otherwise
she could not hold it, it is so strong. They are the twins of Sanga and
therefore this NakShatra is supposed to produce twins, Mangal in this
NakShatra - specially if the Lagna is in Kumbha and Mangal in bhatristhan
indicates twin brother and sister for the native. Or if Ravi, Guru or
Pitri Karaka or lord of the Bhava signifying father or son in a similar
way is in this NakShatra then the father or any of the uncles or any of
the children may be one of the twin. Hasta NakShatra: Spread from 10:  
to 23:20' Kanya. Deity Surya, Lord Budha, symbol - closed hand. The 12
names of the sun are: (1) Arun, (2) Aditya, (3) Tapan, (4) Divakar, (5)
Bhaskar, (6) Bhanu, (7) Martanda, (8) Mihir, (9) Ravi, (10) Bivakar,
(11) Sahasramsu and (12) Surya. All the attributes of these names
etymologically connotes are caused by this star. From the Surya we
derive creativity and creation, and from creation we derive light,
lustre, and strength. Surya is the prime cause of dominion, kingship,
power of immunity and the light that dispels darkness. Budha is the cause
of knowledge. If placed in this star he sheds light all around. Ravi
with this NakShatra enhances the instinct of dominion and the capacity
to rule over others. It brushes up human intelligence, making it more
luminous and makes a man vibrant with life and light. The symbol is a
closed hand or fist. It would follow that is signifies determination and
clenched resolution. To keep everybody within one's grip, the possessive
instinct follows from the nature of this star. The magician and the
pick-pocket are also born under this star - variation from nobler
attributes. Anthropomorphically it is the hand of Kalapurush. Bharani
NakShatra: Devata Yama; birth star of Rahu. It extends from 13:20
t o 26:40. Symbol: Orifice of the womb (oss-mouth), lord Mangal. It
is possible to hav e an idea of the nature of Bharani NakShatra from
the nature of Rahu, Mangal and Yama. To take Rahu first, 1. Rahu gives
extravagant enjoyment of material pleasure and is later on the cause of
sorrow, 2. Mangal gives courage, strength, exaltation and hope, 3. Yama
purity, cleanliness, justice and integrity. The sense of restraint is also
Yamas gift; he is the lord of Dharma, a stern disciplinarian, a ruthless
expositor of truth, and a refuge for kings and law-abiding subjects. We
should not always confine his interpretation to his being only the lord
of death; he is the great judicature, the ultimate dispenser of reward
and punishment. The story of Yama-Nachiketa is a particularly exposition
of the hospitality of Yama, his sense of dharma and knowledge of it,
his superb honesty and great integrity and other divine virtues. The
NakShatra of which he is the devata (God) is also in consequence the
giver of whatever is good, pure, truthful and honest. The etymological
meaning of Bharani is what deserves to be cultivated and preserved
that is dependence, servitors, retainers or anything by which living
is earned, for example salary. Krithika NakShatra: This is the birth
star of Chandra. Many constellations gather at the tail end of Krithika
group. It extends from Mesa 26:40. The residuary 10: degree fall in
Vrishabha. The Devata is Agni, Lord (Adhipati) is Mangal and Sukar. Agni
is the great purifier, the great consumer of and the giver of light,
heat and brightness. Agni causes the fire of life and the drive. It is
also the spark of life. Without fire creation would not exist. Agni
is at the base of creation and of the continuation of existence. It
consumes everything. The fire of digestion in the human system and the
external fire for cooking are only different manifestation of the same
principle which is Agni. Agni is the symbol of brightness and brilliance,
all weapons with fire-power. And other things of the same category come
within the range of Krithika group. The fire is considered as purifier;
for it burns away all that is wicked, dark and dull, also all that is low
and sinful and inauspicious in the world. The dross thus blazed away,
only effulgence and light remain. Fire gives the earth its activity
and dynamic and revives it after the spells of cold that periodically
inflict comatose condition of the earth. It is easy enough to deduce
from fire the causal effect of the Krithika group. Mangal is the lord
of that part of Krithika which is in Mesa Rashi and Mangal is like
a mass of lightning in shining splendour. So, the Krithika in Mesa
is devastatingly brilliant, the effulgence being closely associated
with also an incendiary character. The Krithika of Vrishabha Rashi is
brilliant but unlike the Krithika of Mesa, not incendiary. The lord
of Vrishabha Rashi is brilliant but unlike the Krithika of Mesa, not
incendiary. The Lord of Vrishabha Rashi is Sukra and Sukra stands for
worship of beauty and for poetry and imagination. He is radiantly white
like snow, the Kunda flower and the Utpal. He is also the encyclopedic
expounder of all branches of learning. It follows that the Krithika of
Vrishabha is brilliant but the brilliance does not burn, it is soft and
sweet, and benign.The Krithika of Mesa Rashi is doubtless brilliant,
it has plenty of heat which burns. The Krithika of Vrishabha has on
the contrary a softened radiance, a wave of brightness that does not
hurt. Anuradha NakShatra: Spread from 3:20' to 16᳚40' Vrscika Rashi. Lord
is Mang al, Symbol - the same as that of Visakha. Visakha and Anuradha
are complimentary to each other. From Anuradha is derived friendship,
love, affection and other tender feature of a person's character. From
Visakha is considered the ultimate objective while from Anuradha is
indicated the action. The difference between Visakha and Anuradha
is that while the Visakha-native forgets after success about benefits
derived as also the persons who helped, the Anuradha-native retains soft
feeling about them, he keeps his friendship intact and does not forget
the benefits. The Anuradha-native's mind is always alive and receptive
to all feelings and gestures of friendship and love. He is like the
sentinel always a mounting guard over emotions, but lacking the hardness
or toughness of the official sentinel. Rohini NakShatra: The word is
derived from Rohan which means to rise or to bring into existence. It
extends in the Vrishabha Rashi from 10 degree to 23:20. The lord of it is
Sukra, the symbol a Cart drawn by Cows. The Devata is Brahma, the prime
creator of all things living, from the meanest insect to Man, the beauty
of the weird, the paragon of animals. Rohini- group therefore encompasses
everything that comes within the range of creation--beasts, birds,
animals etc. It would also connote the process of growing, begetting,
birth, production etc, in brief production, birth and creation. Rising
means process of ascending, that is to say the creative evolution, the
cultivation and the improvement. Mythology describes Rohini the wife of
Chandra. Of all the 27 Stars-all wives of Chandra-Rohini is said to have
been fond of fine dress, cosmetics and decore and was the most beloved
of Chandra. The Rohini (group) is, in the line with this, considered to
be the cause of a taste for fine dress, perfume, and other articles of
toilet. Creation continues to exist mainly on the basis of food; and
Rohini is supposed to be the cause of food. The direct and immediate
cause of food is Agni and Brahma the remote cause. From this point of
view the God who gives food, that is Agni, is the spiritual principle of
Rohini (group) NakShatra and because, Brahma the remote cause of food is
also the Devata of Rohini; the range of influences of this group runs
over the whole gamut of the visible and invisible animal world. Swati
NakShatra: Spread from 6:40' to 20: Tula. Lord is Sukra, the deity is
the Wind and because of this latter factor this causes the attributes
of the Wind. Restlessness of disposition or physical restlessness,
inability to stay still at any place comes from it; also fidgetiness
and noise. It is self-assured and asserting. The winds (Murut) are the
Lords of North-West. The 49 of them under the Paban, of all Gods he is
the strongest and most obstinate. From these are derived the knowledge,
the physical internal adjustments of the 5 Winds - Pan, Apan, Vyan,
Udan and Saman. Also from this comes the storms and the whirl-wind,
the concrete disturbance of the atmosphere, A person born under this
star is good at buying and selling, his wealth and property come and go
quite easily. He is an independent sort of man, always striving for more
independence. Asceticism is yet another attribute of this star. diseases
of the wind are to be treated in reference to this . The Wind is the great
scavenger, it sweats the dross and purifies. The winowing of rice bears
comparison to this. Mrigasira NakShatra: Mrigasira NakShatra extends from
after 23:20 in Vrishabha Rashi up to 6:40 in Mithune. Presiding deity
Chandra. Symbol-Antilope or Deer. The word Mriga represents forests,
gardens, a search, a seeking to find, to roam about in the forests
and a hunter, to seek, to blaze the trail, a guide and preceptor. An
erotic affair, beauty of the countenance with particular emphasis on
the radiant lustre of the face, because of Chandra. To seek as the
primary characteristic of the star, to discover hidden treasures after
the churning of the Sea, the Samudra Manthan of the Hindu Mythology,
the mother, motherly conduct that is to say maternal instincts,
self-sacrifice without hope of requital etc. Chandra is the lord of the
mind, so all mental attitude, good or bad, sympathies and antipathies,
patience and impatience, the fidgetiness and placidity, imagination,
the gift of poetry, purity, sweetness and light, physical and mental
aspects, all these come within this star and when things of sweetness
and light of physic as also of the mind, both derivatives from Chandra,
the horoscope of Rabindra Nath comes to mind. His Janma Lagna was Meen
with Chandra there and Guru was in Karkata Rashi. Because of this yoga
Rabindra Nath had something like physical translucence which was object
of admiration all the world over, wherever people met. Also, at the same
time his poetry enthralled the whole world. Chandra is a sub-Graha around
the earth and that is why the influence of Chandra on all that happens
in the earth is so paramount. And again that is why the influence of
Chandra on both the body and mind is simultaneously so very great. Sukra
and Chandra both are female grahas (planets) with difference that while
Chandra is the Lord of motherhood, maternal instincts and all that,
Sukra is the lord of feminine beauty, the structure of feminine form,
the physical excellence of women and all that. In the former there is
elegance and dignity of the feminine while in the latter, the physical
beauty and the lure of feminine form which leads a male captive
dominates. Chandra is the lord of marine products and of medicines;
that it was from the sea that Chandra rose. And it is to Chandra that
the influences and causalities have to be traced. Mrigasira NakShatra:

to Chandra that the influences and causalities have to be traced. Moola
NakShatra: Spread from 0: to 13:20' Dhanu Rashi, Lord is Jupiter
(Guru). Symbol - a bunch of roots tied together, deity 'Nirithi' or
'AlakShmi'. It also means the 'opposite' or 'reverse'. Moola is not
one of the good stars which is evident from this that the deity is
AlakShmi i.e. God of ill luck. Moola signifies roots, that is to say,
everything of basic nature, its motion is finite and limited. It does
not go beyond its narrow orbit. Old servant, pedlar of seeds, physician
administering herbal seed remedies - every such thing is determined
from this star. The Moola native looks into scientific, literary,
philosophic and other basic subjects. Mortgate and Mortgaged property are
governed by this star and its horizon is not rural but urban. Uttarasarha
NakShatra: Spread from 26:40' Dhanu to 10: of Makara. Lord is Guru and
Sani. The derivatives from Uttarasarha are closely allied to those of
Poorbasarha. The points of difference are as follows. Poorbasarha spreads
out, it is concerned with extensiveness. Uttarasarha is introspective
and penetrative and is concerned with intensiveness, the results of
the latter being more permanent than the former (Poorbasarha). The
deity who preserves this world and makes for its welfare is called
ganadevata. There are ten ganadevatas Basu, Satya, Kratu, DakSha, Kala,
Kama, Dhriti, Kuru, Pururaba, Madraba. All their attributes are in this
star. The warrior, the wrestler, the painter, the artist, the magician,
the well-dressed man, the happy and successful men are influenced by
this star. A special characteristic of it is that it causes a person
to be admired and socially applauded. Another characteristic of it is
is that under the influence of this star the native falls in love with
an unmarried girl. Vishma of the Mahabharata was one of the 8 Basus;
so under this star one possesses self-control, restraint, endurance and
firm character. There are special rituals for the worship of ganadevatas,
which are more or less of specialised nature. The juice of Soma plant
plays a part in yagna and worship.

Chapter 34 Yoga Karakas 1. O Brahmin, thus I have told you about the
effects derivable through Karakamsh. Now listen to the effects arising
out of lordships of grahas over bhavas.

2-7. Nature due to Lordships of Grahas: Benefics owning Kendras will
not give benefic effects, while malefics owning Kendras will not remain
inauspicious. The lord of a Kon will give auspicious results. The
lord of Lagn is specially auspicious as Lagn is a Kendr as well as a
Kon. Putr and Dharm Bhava are specially for wealth, while Yuvati and
Karm Bhava are specially for happiness. Any grah owning Sahaj, Ari,
or Labh Bhava will give evil effects. The effects due to the lords of
Vyaya and Randhr Bhava will depend on their association. In each group,
the significance will be in the ascending order. Randhr's lord is not
auspicious as he owns the 12th from Dharm Bhava. If the lord of Randhr
Bhava simultaneously owns Sahaj, Yuvati, or Labh Bhava, he will prove
specifically harmful, while his simultaneous ownership of a Kon will
bestow auspicious effects. The grah owning a predominant Bhava will stall
the effects due to another owning a less significant bhava and will give
his own results. Randhr's lordship of Surya and Chandr is not evil.

8-10. Natural Benefics and Natural Malefics: Guru and Shukr are
benefics, while Chandr is mediocre in benefice and Buddh is neutral
(i.e. a benefic when associated with a benefic and a malefic when related
to a malefic). Malefics are Surya, Shani, and Mangal. Full Chandr, Buddh,
Guru and Shukr are stronger in the ascending order. Weak Chandr, Surya,
Shani, and Mangal are stronger (in malefic disposition) in the ascending
order. In revealing maleficence due to rulership of Kendras, Chandr,
Buddh, Guru, and Shukr are significant in the ascending order.

11-12. Lordships of Kendras and Konas: If there be an exchange between
an lord of a Kendr and a lord of a Kon, or if a lord of a Kendr is yuti
with a lord of a Kon in a Kendr or in a Kon, or if a lord of a Kon is in
a Kendr or vice versa, or if there happens to be a full drishti between
a lord of a Kendr and a lord of a Kon, they cause a Yog. One born in
such a Yog will become a king and be famous.

13. If one and the same grah gets the lordships of a Kon as well as a
Kendr, or if a grah is in a Kendr or in a Kon, it will prove specially
a Yog Karak.

14. Lordship of Kendr: It has been said that a malefic owning a Kendr
will become auspicious, which is true only when it simultaneously lords
over a Kon and not by merely owning a Kendr.

15. If the lords of a Kendr or a Kon own simultaneously an evil bhava. he
(i.e. the lord of the Kendr or the lord of the Kon) does not cause a
Raj Yog by mere relations stipulated (as per ch.

34, slokas 11 and 12).

16. Rahu and Ketu: Rahu and Ketu give predominantly the effects as due
to their yuti with a bhava lord or as due to the bhava they occupy.

17. If Rahu and Ketu are in Kendr receiving a drishti from or in
association with the lord of a Kon, or if Rahu or Ketu happen to be in
a Kendr receiving a drishti from or in association with the lord of a
Kendr it will become Yog Karak.

18. 0 Maharishi Parashar, please narrate according to the rashis rising
as to which grah is a Yog Karak and which is inauspicious.

19-22. Grahas and Mesh Lagn: O Brahmin, listen to these with
examples. Even though Mangal is the lord of Randhr Bhava, he will
be helpful to (other) auspicious grahas. Shani, Buddh, and Shukr are
malefics. Auspicious are Guru and Surya. The mere yuti of Shani with
Guru will not produce auspicious effects (although they own a Kon and
a Kendr). If Guru is at the disposal of a malefic, he will surely give
inauspicious results. Shukr is a direct (or independent) killer. Shani,
etc., will also inflict death if associated with an adverse grah
(i.e Shukr).

23-24. Grahas and Vrishabh Lagn: Guru, Shukr, and Chandr are
malefics. Shani and Surya are auspicious. Shani will cause Raj Yog. Buddh
is somewhat inauspicious; the Guru group (Guru, Chandr, and Shukr),
and Mangal will inflict death.

25-26. Grahas and Mithun Lagn: Mangal, Guru, and Surya are malefics,
while Shukr is the only auspicious grah. The yuti of Guru with Shani
is similar to that for Mesh Lagn. Chandr is the prime killer, but it is
dependant on her association.

27-28. Grahas and Kark Lagn: Shukr and Buddh are malefics, Mangal, Guru,
and Chandr are auspicious. Mangal is capable of conferring a full-fledged
Yog and giving auspicious effects. Shani and Surya are killers and give
effects according to their associations.

29-30. Grahas and Simh Lagn: Buddh, Shukr, and Shani are
malefics. Auspicious effects will be given by Mangal, Guru, and
Surya. Guru's yuti with Shukr (though respectively Kon and Kendr lords)
will not produce auspicious results. Shani and Chandr are killers who
will give effects according to their associations.

31-32. Grahas and Kanya Lagn: Mangal, Guru, and Chandr are malefics,
while Buddh and Shukr are auspicious. Shukr's yuti with Buddh will
produce Yog. Shukr is a killer as well. Surya's role will depend on
his association.

33-34. Grahas and Tula Lagn: Guru, Surya, and Mangal are
malefics. Auspicious are Shani and Buddh. Chandr and Buddh will cause
Raj Yog. Mangal is a killer. Guru and other malefics will also acquire
a disposition to inflict death. Shukr is neutral.

35-36. Grahas and Vrischik Lagn: Shukr, Buddh, and Shani are
malefics. Guru and Chandr are auspicious. Surya as well as Chandr are
Yog Karakas. Mangal is neutral. Shukr and other malefics acquire the
quality of causing death.

37-38. Grahas and Dhanu Lagn: Only Shukr is inauspicious. Mangal
and Surya are auspicious. Surya and Buddh are capable of conferring a
Yog. Shani is a killer, Guru is neutral. Shukr acquires killing powers.

39-40. Grahas and Makar Lagn: Mangal, Guru, and Chandr are malefics,
Shukr and Buddh are auspicious. Shani will not be a killer on his
own. Mangal and other malefics will inflict death. Surya is neutral. Only
Shukr is capable of causing a superior Yog.

41-42. Grahas and Kumbh Lagn: Guru, Chandr, and Mangal are malefics,
while Shukr and Shani are auspicious. Shukr is the only grah that causes
Raj Yog. Guru, Surya, and Mangal are killers. Buddh gives meddling
effects.

43-44. Grahas and Meen Bhava: Shani, Shukr, Surya, and Buddh are
malefics. Mangal and Chandr are auspicious. Mangal and Guru will
cause a Yog. Though Mangal is a killer he will not kill the native
(independently). Shani and Buddh are killers.

45-46. General: Thus, the auspicious and inauspicious effects derivable
through the grahas due to their lordship according to the rising rashi,
have to be estimated. Apart, the effects due to Nabhash Yogas, etc.,
should also be known which I narrate as under.

<HR>

Chapter 35 Nabhash Yogas 1-2.  O excellent of the Brahmins, explained
below are 32 Nabhash Yogas which have a total of 1800 different
varieties. These consist of 3 Asraya Yogas, 2 Dala Yogas, 20 Akriti Yogas,
and 7 Sankhya Yogas.

3-6. Names of Nabhash Yogas: The 3 Asraya Yogas are: Rajju, Musala,
and Nala Yogas; The 2 Dala Yogas are: MAl and Sarpa; The 20 Akriti Yogas
are: Gada, Sakat, Shringatak, Vihag, Hal, Vajr, Kamal, Vapi, Yup, Shar,
Shakti, Danda, Nisk, Koot, Chatr, Dhanushi, (or Chap), Ardh, Chandr,
Chakr, and Samudr Yogas; The 7 Sankhya Yogas are: Vallaki, DAm, PAsh,
Kedara, Sool, Yuga, and Gola Yogas. Thus, these are 32 in total.

7. Rajju, Musala, and Nala Yogas: All the grahas in movable rashis
cause Rajju Yog. All the grahas in fixed rashis cause Musala Yog. All
the grahas in dual rashis cause Nala Yog.

8. MAl and Sarpa Yogas: If 3 Kendras are occupied by benefics MAl
Yog is produced, (benefic results) while malefics so placed will cause
Bhujang or Sarpa Yog. These Yogas respectively produce benefic and
malefic results.

9-11. Gada, Sakat, Vihag, Shringatak, Hal, Vajr, and Yav Yoga If all
the grahas occupy two successive Kendras, Gada Yog is formed. Sakat Yog
occurs when all the grahas are disposed in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava. If
all confine to Bandhu and Karm Bhava, then Vihag Yog occurs. All grahas
in Lagn, Putr and Dharm Bhava cause Shringatak Yog, while all grahas
are in Dhan, Ari, and Karm Bhava, or in Sahaj, Yuvati, and Labh Bhava,
or in Bandhu, Randhr, and Vyaya Bhava cause Hal Yog. Vajr Yog is caused
by all benefics in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava, or all malefics in Bandhu and
Karm Bhava. In a contrary situation, i.e. all benefics in Bandhu and
Karm Bhava or all malefics in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava, Yav Yog is generated.

12. Kamal and Vapi Yogas: If all the grahas are in the 4 Kendras, Kamal
Yog is produced. If all of them happen to be in all the Apoklimas (cadent
bhavas), or in all the Panapharas (succedent bhavas), Vapi Yog occurs.

13. Yup, Shar, Shakti, and Danda Yogas: If all the 7 grahas are in the
4 bhavas commencing from Lagn, they cause Yup Yog; if all the 7 grahas
are in the 4 bhavas commencing from Bandhu Bhava Shar Yog occurs; if all
the 7 grahas are in the 4 bhavas commencing from Yuvati Bhava Shakti Yog
occurs; and if all the 7 grahas are in the 4 bhavas commencing from Karm
Bhava Danda Yog is formed.

14. Nauka, Koot, Chatr, and Chap Yogas: If all the grahas occupy the
seven bhavas from Lagn Nauka Yog occurs; if all the grahas occupy
the seven bhavas from Bandhu Bhava Koot Yog is formed; if all the
grahas occupy the seven bhavas from Yuvati Bhava Chatr Yog occurs;
and if all the seven grahas occupy the seven bhavas from Karm Bhava,
Chap Yog occurs. Here again, the grahas should occupy seven continuous
bhavas. Quoted from saravali: If the seven grahas occupy continuously

Chapter 36 Many Other Yogas 1-2. Benefic and Malefic Yogas: If there be
a benefic in Lagn, Subh Yog is produced, while a malefic in Lagn causes
Asubh Yog. Benefics in both Vyaya and Dhan Bhava cause Subh Yog. Malefics
in both Vyaya and Dhan Bhava cause Asubh Yog. One born in Subh Yog will be
eloquent, charming, and virtuous, while his counterpart will be sensuous,
will do sinful acts, and will enjoy (or swallow) others' wealth.

3-4. Gaj Kesari Yog: Should Guru be in a Kendr from Lagn or from Chandr,
and be yuti with or receiving a drishti from (another) benefic, avoiding
at the same time debilitation, combustion, and inimical rashi, Gaj Kesari
Yog is caused. One born in Gaj Kesari Yog will be splendorous, wealthy
intelligent endowed with many laudable virtues and will please the king.

5-6. Amal Yog: If there be exclusively a benefic in the 10th from Lagn
or Chandr, Amal Yog exists. Amal Yog will confer fame lasting till Chandr
and stars exist and will make the native honoured by the king, enjoy
abundant pleasures, charitable, fond of relatives, helpful to others,
pious, and virtuous.

7-8. Parvat Yog: Benefics in Kendras will produce Parvat Yog, as Yuvati
and Randhr Bhava are vacant or are occupied by only benefics. One born
in Parvat Yog will be wealthy, eloquent, charitable, learned in Shastras,
fond of mirth, famous, splendorous, and be the leader of a city.

9-10. Kahal Yog: Should Bandhu's lord and Guru be in mutual Kendras,
while Lagn's lord is strong, Kahal Yog occurs. Alternatively, Bandhu's
lord being in his own or exaltation rashi should be yuti with Karm's
lord. In effect, the native will be energetic, adventurous, charming,
endowed with a complete army consisting of chariots elephants horses
and infantry, and he will lord over a few villages.

11-12. Chamar Yog: If Lagn's lord is exalted in a Kendr and receives
a drishti from Guru, Chamar Yog is formed. This Yog also occurs if two
benefics are in Lagn, or Dharm, or Karm, or Yuvati Bhava. The effects
of Chamar Yog are: the native will be a king or honoured by the king,
long lived, scholarly, eloquent, and versed in all arts.

13-14. Shankh Yog: If Lagn's lord is strong, while the lords of Putr
and Ari Bhava are in mutual Kendras, then, what is known as Shankh Yog
is produced. Alternatively, if Lagn's lord along with Karm's lord is in a
movable rashi, while Dharm's lord is strong, Shankh Yog is obtained. One
born with Shankh Yog will be endowed with wealth, spouse and sons; he will
be kindly disposed, propitious, intelligent, meritorious, and long lived.

15-16. Bhairi Yog: If Vyaya, Tanu, Dhan, and Yuvati Bhava are occupied as
Dharm's lord is strong, the native obtains Bhairi Yog. Again, another kind
of Bhairi Yog is formed if Shukr, Guru, and Lagn's lord are in a Kendr,
while Dharm's lord is strong. The results of Bhairi Yog are: the native
will be endowed with wealth, wife and sons; he will be a king, be famous,
virtuous, and endowed with good behaviour, happiness, and pleasures.

17. Mridang Yog: If Lagn's lord is strong and others occupy Kendras,
Konas, own bhavas or exaltation rashis, Mridang Yog is formed. The native
concerned will be a king or equal to a king and be happy.

18. Shrinath Yog: If Yuvati's lord is in Karm Bhava, while Karm's lord
is exalted and yuti with Dharm's lord, Shrinath Yog takes place. The
native with Shrinath Yog will be equal to lord Devendra (the god of gods).

19-20. Sharad Yog: Should Karm's lord be in Putr Bhava, while Buddh is
in a Kendr, as Surya with strength is in Simh, Sharad Yog is formed. This
will again be obtained if Guru or Buddh is in a Kon to Chandr, while
Mangal is in Labh Bhava. One born in either kind of Yog will obtain
wealth, spouse and sons, be happy, scholarly, dear to the king, pious,
and virtuous.

21-22. Matsya Yog: Benefics in Dharm and Tanu Bhava, mixed grahas
in Putr Bhava and malefics in Bandhu and Randhr Bhava: this array of
grahas at birth will produce Matsya Yog. In effect, the native will be
a Jyotishi, be a synonym of kindness, be virtuous, strong, beautiful,
famous, learned, and pious.

23-24. Kurm Yog: If Putr, Ari and Yuvati Bhava occupied by benefic grahas
identical with own bhava, or exaltation, or friendly rashi, while malefics
are in Sahaj, Labh, and Tanu Bhava, in own bhava or in exaltation, Kurm
Yog is formed. The results of Kurm Yog are: the native will be a king. be
courageous, virtuous, famous, helpful, happy; he will be a leader of men.

25-26. Khadg Yog: Should there be an exchange of rashis between the
lords of Dhan and Dharm Bhava, as Lagn's lord is in a Kendr or in a Kon
Khadg Yog is obtained. One with Khadg Yog will be endowed with wealth,
fortunes and happiness, be learned in Shastras, be intelligent, mighty,
grateful, and skilful.

27-28. LakShmi Yog: If Dharm's lord is in a Kendr identical with his
Mooltrikon rashi, or own rashi, or in exaltation, while Lagn's lord is
endowed with strength, LakShmi Yog occurs. The native with LakShmi Yog
will be charming, virtuous, kingly in status, endowed with many sons
and abundant wealth; he will be famous and of high moral merits.

29-30. Kusum Yog: Shukr in a Kendr, Chandr in a Kon along with a benefic
and Shani in Karm Bhava: these grahas thus cause Kusum Yog for one born
in a fixed rashi ascending. Such a native will be a king or equal to him,
be charitable, will enjoy pleasures, be happy, prime among his race men,
virtuous and red-lettered.

31-32. Kalanidhi Yog: If Guru is placed in Dhan, or Putr Bhava, and
receives a drishti from Buddh and Shukr, Kalanidhi Yog is caused. In
effect, the native will be virtuous, honoured by the kings, bereft of
diseases, be happy, wealthy, and learned.

33-34. Kalpa Drum Yog: Note the following four grahas: (a) Lagn's lord,
(b) the dispositor of Lagn's lord, (c) the dispositor of the grah at b,
(d) the Navamsh dispositor of the grah at c. If all these are disposed in
Kendras and in Konas from Lagn, or are exalted, Kalpa Drum Yog exists. One
with Kalpa Drum Yog will be endowed with all kinds of wealth, be a king,
pious, strong, fond war, and merciful.

35-36. Trimurthi Yogas: Counted from Dhan's lord, if benefics occupy
the 2nd, 12th, and 8th, Hari Yog is formed. (The native will be happy,
learned, and endowed with wealth and sons). If the 4th, 9th, and 8th
with reference to the rashi occupied by Yuvati's lord are occupied by
benefics, Hara Yog is obtainable. (The native will be happy, learned,
and endowed with wealth and sons). Brahma Yog is generated if, counted
from Lagn's lord, benefics are in the 4th, 10th, and 11th rashis. One
born in anyone of the said three Yogas will be happy, learned, and
endowed with wealth and sons.

37. Lagn Adhi Yog: Should benefics be in Yuvati and Randhr Bhava counted
from Lagn, and be devoid of yuti with, and/or drishti from malefics,
Lagn Adhi Yog is produced making one a great person, learned in Shastras
and happy.

38-39. Effects of Lagn's Lord's Division Dignities: Lagn's lord in
Parijatamsh will make one happy; Lagn's lord in Vargottama will give
immunity to diseases; Lagn's lord in Gopuramsh will make one rich with
wealth and grains; Lagn's lord in Simhasanamsh will make one a king;
Lagn's lord in Paravatamsh will make one a scholar; Lagn's lord in
Devalokamsh will make one opulent and endowed with conveyances; and Lagn's
lord in Iravatamsh will make one famous and honoured by kings. (Vargottama
indicates a grah occupying the same Rashi and the same Navamsh).

<HR>

Chapter 37 Chandr's Yogas 1. If Chandr with reference to Surya is in a
Kendr, one's wealth, intelligence and skill will be little. If Chandr
with reference to Surya is in a Panaphara, one's wealth, intelligence
and skill will be meddling. If Chandr with reference to Surya is in a
Apoklima, one's wealth, intelligence and skill will be excellent.

2-4. In the case of a day birth, if Chandr placed in its own Navamsh,
or in a friendly Navamsh, receives a drishti from Guru, one will be
endowed with wealth, and happiness. One born at night time will enjoy
similar effects if Chandr is in its own Navamsh, or in a friendly Navamsh
receiving a drishti to Shukr. In a contrary situation, the drishti
from Guru, or from Shukr on Chandr will make one go with little wealth,
or even without that.

5. Adhi Yog from Chandr: If benefics occupy the 8th, 6th, and 7th
counted from Chandr, Adhi Yog obtains. According to the strength of
the participating grahas, the native concerned will be either a king,
or a minister, or an army chief.

6. Dhan Yog: Should all the (three) benefics be Upachaya, i.e. in the
3rd, the 6th, the 10th, and the 11th counted from Chandr, one will be
very affluent; with two benefics placed in the 3rd, the 6th, the 10th,
and the 11th one will have medium effects in regard to wealth. If a
single benefic is there, the wealth will be negligible.

7-10. Sunaph, Anaph, and Duradhar: If there is a grah, other than
Surya, in the 2nd from Chandr Sunaph Yog is formed; if there is a grah,
other than Surya, in the 12th from Chandr Anaph Yog is formed; and if
there are grahas, other than Surya, in the 2nd from Chandr and in the
12th from Chandr Duradhar Yog is caused. One with Sunaph Yog will be
a king or equal to a king endowed with intelligence, wealth, fame, and
self earned wealth. One born in Anaph Yog will be a king, be free from
diseases, virtuous, famous, charming, and happy. One born in Duradhar Yog
will enjoy pleasures; one will be charitable, and endowed with wealth,
conveyances, and excellent serving force.

11-13. Kema Drum Yog: Excluding Surya, should there be no grah with
Chandr, or in the 2nd and/or 12th from Chandr, or in a Kendr from Lagn,
Kema Drum Yog is formed. One born in Kema Drum Yog will be very much
reproached; one will be bereft of intelligence; learning is reduced to
penury and perils.

<HR>

Chapter 38 Surya's Yogas 1. Vesi, Vosi, and Abhayachari Yogas: Barring
Chandr, if a grah among Mangal etc. be in the 2nd from Surya, Vesi Yog is
formed; barring Chandr, if a grah among Mangal etc. be in the 12th from
Surya, Vosi Yog is formed; and barring Chandr, if a grah among Mangal
etc. be in both the 2nd and the 12th from Surya Ubhayachari Yog is caused.

2-3. Effects of Vesi, Vosi, and Ubhayachari Yogas: One born in Vesi
Yog will be even sighted, truthful, long bodied, indolent, happy, and
endowed with negligible wealth. One born with Vosi Yog will be skilful,
charitable, and endowed with fame, learning and strength. The Ubhayachari
native will be a king or a equal to a king and be happy.

4. Benefics causing Vesi, Vosi, or Ubhayachari Yogas will give the
above mentioned effects, while malefics will produce contrary effects.

Chapter 39 Raj Yog 1-2.

0 excellent of the Brahmins, I now narrate below the Raj Yogas making
one entitled to royal honour. These were told to Parvati by Lord Shiva
once upon a time, the gist of which is as follows: 3-5. Raj Yogas are
to be known from the Karakamsh Lagn and the natal Lagn. On the one hand
the pair of Atma Karak and Putr Karak should be considered and on the
other hand the natal Lagn's lord and Putr's lord should be taken into
consideration. The effects due to such association will be full, or a
half, or a quarter according to their strengths. (Karakamsh Lagn is the
Navamsh occupied by the Atma Karak grah).

6-7. Maha Raj Yog: Should Lagn's Lord and Putr's lord exchange their
rashis or if Atma Karak and Putr Karak (Char) are in Lagn, or in Putr
Bhava, or in the exaltation rashi, or in own rashi, or in own Navamsh
receiving a drishti from a benefic, Maha Raj Yog is produced. The native
so born will be famous and happy.

8. If Lagn's lord and Atma Karak are in Tanu, Putr, or Yuvati Bhava
yuti with or receiving a drishti from a benefic, a Raj Yog is formed.

9-10. Should there be benefics in the 2nd, the 4th, and the 5th counted
either from Lagn's lord or from Atma Karak rashi, one will become a
king. Similarly, malefics in the 3rd and 6th from Lagn's lord or from
Atma Karak rashi will make one a king.

11. One will be related to royal circles if Shukr is the Karakamsh, or
in the 5th there from, or in Lagn, or in Arudh Lagn receiving a drishti
from, or yuti with Guru or Chandr.

12. Even if a single grah gives a drishti to the natal Lagn or Hora
Lagn or Ghatik Lagn, the native will become a king.

13-14. If the six divisions (Shad Vargas) of Lagn are occupied or
receive a drishti from one and the same grah, a Raj Yog is doubtlessly
formed. Accordingly, if the drishti is full, half, or one fourth,
results will be in order full, medium, and negligible.

15. If the 3 Lagnas (i.e. natal Lagn, Hora Lagn, and Ghatik Lagn) are
occupied by grahas in exaltation or in own rashi, or if the natal Lagn,
the Dreshkan Lagn, and the Navamsh Lagn have exalted grahas, Raj Yog
is formed.

16. If Chandr and a benefic are in the Arudh Lang as Guru is in the 2nd
from the natal Lagn and both these places are receiving drishtis from
grahas in exaltation, or grahas in own rashi, there will be a Raj Yog.

17. If Lagn, Dhan, and Bandhu Bhava are occupied be benefics, while a
malefic is in Sahaj Bhava, one will become a king or equal to a king.

18. The native will be wealthy if one among Chandr, Guru, Shukr, and
Buddh is exalted in Dhan Bhava.

19. If Ari, Randhr, and Sahaj Bhava are occupied by debilitated grahas
as Lagn's lord is exalted, or is in (his other) own Bhava, and gives a
drishti to Lagn, there is a Raj Yog.

20. Again, a Raj Yog is formed if Ari's, Randhr's, and Vyaya's lords are
in fall or in inimical rashis, or in combustion, as Lagn's lord placed in
his (other) own rashi or in its exaltation rashi gives a drishti to Lagn.

21. If Karm's lord, placed in his own bhava, or in its exaltation rashi,
gives a drishti to Lagn, a Raj Yog is formed. Similar is the case if
benefics are in Kendras. (a Raj Yog is formed) 22. If the Atma Karak
grah is in a benefic's Rashi/Navamsh, the native will be wealthy. If
there are benefics in Kendras from Karakamsh Lagn, he will become a king.

23. If the Arudh Lagn and Dar Pad are in mutual Kendras or in mutual
Sahaj/Labh bhavas, or in mutual Konas, the native will doubtlessly become
a king.

24. If two or all of Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn, Ghatik Lagn are receiving
a drishti from exalted grahas, a Raj Yog is formed.

25. If Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn, and Ghatik Lagn, their Dreshkanas and
Navamshas, or the said Lagnas and their Navamshas, or the said Lagnas
and their Dreshkanas receive a drishti from a grah, a Raj Yog is formed.

26-27. If Arudh Pad is occupied by an exalted grah particularly Chandr
in exaltation, or by Guru and/or Shukr (with or without exaltation),
while there is no Argala by a malefic, the native will become a king. If
the Arudh Pad is a benefic rashi containing Chandr, while Guru is in
Dhan Bhava the same effect will prevail.

28. Even if one among Ari's, Randhr's, and Vyaya's lords being in
debilitation gives a drishti to Lagn, there will be a Raj Yog.

29-31. The native will become a king if a grah ruling Bandhu, Karm,
Dhan, or Labh gives a drishti to Lagn, while Shukr gives a drishti to
the 11th from Arudh Lagn as Arudh Lagn is occupied by a benefic. The
same effect will be obtained if a debilitated grah gives a drishti to
Lagn and is placed in Ari or Randhr Bhava. (i.e. The native will become
a king) Again, similar result will prevail if a debilitated grah placed
in Sahaj or Labh Bhava gives a drishti to Lagn. (i.e. The native will
become a king) 32. I now tell you of the Raj Yogas based on the grahas
with different dignities and on the drishtis and yutis of the grahas.

33-34. Dharm's lord is akin to a minister, and more especially Putr's
lord. If these two grahas mutually give a drishti, the native will obtain
a kingdom. Even if these two are yuti in any bhava, or if they happen
to be placed in mutually 7th places, one born of royal scion will become
a king.

35. The native will attain a kingdom if Bandhu's lord is in Karm Bhava
and Karm's lord is in Bandhu Bhava, and if these grahas give a drishti
to Putr's and Dharm's lords.

36. If the lords of Putr, Karm, Bandhu, and Lagn are yuti in Dharm Bhava,
one will become a ruler with fame spreading over the four directions.

37. Should the lord of Bandhu Bhava, or of Karm Bhava join either the
Putr's lord or Dharm's lord, the native will obtain a kingdom.

38. If Putr's lord is in Lagn, Bandhu, or Karm Bhava yuti with Dharm's
lord or Lagn lord, the native will become a king.

39. Should Guru be in his own rashi identical with Dharm Bhava and yuti
with either Shukr or Putr's lord, the native will obtain royal status.

40. Two and a half ghatis (i.e.

60 minutes of time) from mid-day or from mid-night is auspicious time. A
birth during such an auspicious time will cause one to be a king or
equal to him.

41. Should Chandr and Shukr be mutually in Sahaj and Labh Bhava and
receiving drishtis from each other while they are placed elsewhere
(i.e. not in Sahaj and Labh Bhava), a Raj Yog is obtained.

42. Should Chandr, endowed with strength, be Vargottamsh and receives
a drishti from four or more grahas, the native will become a king.

43. One will become a king if Lagn in Uttamamsh receives a drishti from
four or more grahas out of which Chandr should not be one.

44. If one or two or three grahas are in exaltation, one of a royal scion
will become a king, while another will be equal to a king or be wealthy.

45. If four or five grahas occupy their exaltation rashis or Mooltrikon
rashis, even a person of base birth will become king.

46. If six grahas are exalted, the native will become emperor and will
enjoy various kinds of royal paraphernalia.

47. Even if one among Guru, Shukr, and Buddh is in exaltation, while
a benefic is in a Kendr the native will become a king or be equal to him.

48. If all benefics are relegated to Kendras, while malefics are in
Sahaj, Ari, and Labh Bhava, the native, though may be of mean descent
will ascend, the throne.

Chapter 40 Yogas For Royal Association 1. If Karm's lord is yuti with

the native will be a chief in the kings court.

2. If Karm and Labh Bhava are devoid of malefic occupation and devoid
of drishti from a malefic, while Labh Bhava receives a drishti from its

the native will be endowed with great intelligence and will be a king's
minister. ('Karakendr' is interpreted here as the dispositor of Atma

4. If Atma Karak is strong and is with a benefic or Amatya Karak is in
its own Bhava or in exaltation, one will surely become a king's minister.

its own bhava, and gives a drishti to Dharm's lord, the native will be
a king's minister.

9. If the lord of the rashi where Chandr is placed becomes Atma Karak
and if this lord is placed in Tanu Bhava along with a benefic, the native
will become a king's minister at his advanced age.

10. Should the Atma Karak be in Putr, Yuvati, Karm, or Dharm Bhava and
happen to be with a benefic, one will earn wealth through royal patronage.

11. If the Arudh of Dharm Bhava happens to be itself the Janm Lagn,
or if Atma Karak is placed in Dharm Bhava the native will be associated
with royal circles.

12. One will gain through royal association if Labh Bhava is occupied
by its own lord, and is devoid of a drishti from a malefic. The Atma
Karak should at the same time be yuti with a benefic.

13. An exchange of rashis between Karm's lord and Lagn's lord will make
the native associated with the king in a great manner.

14. If Shukr and Chandr are in the 4th from Karakamsh Lagn, the native
will be endowed with royal insignia.

15. Should Lagn's lord, or the Atma Karak, be yuti with Putr's lord
and be in a Kendr or in a Kon, the native will be a king or minister.

Chapter 41 Combinations For Wealth 1. I now tell you of special
combinations giving wealth. One born to these Yogas will surely become
wealthy.

2. Yogas for Great Affluence (up to sloka 8): Should a rashi of Shukr
be Putr Bhava and be occupied by Shukr himself, while Mangal is in Labh
Bhava, the native will obtain great riches.

3. Should a rashi of Buddh be Putr Bhava and be occupied by Buddh himself
as Labh Bhava is occupied by Chandr, Mangal, and Guru, the native will
be very affluent.

4. Should Simh be Putr Bhava and be occupied by Surya himself as Shani,
Chandr, and Guru are in Labh Bhava, the native will be very affluent.

5. Should Surya and Chandr be in Labh Bhava as Shani is in Putr Bhava
identical with his own bhava, the native will be very affluent.

6. Should Guru be in Putr Bhava identical with his own rashi as Buddh
is in Labh Bhava, the native will be very affluent.

7. If a rashi of Mangal happens to be Putr Bhava with Mangal there in
while Shukr is in Labh Bhava, the native will become very affluent.

8. If Kark happens to be Putr Bhava containing Chandr there in, while
Shani is in Labh Bhava, the native will become very affluent.

9. Yogas for Wealth (up to sloka 15): Should Surya be in Simh identical
with Lagn, and be yuti with or receiving a drishti from Mangal and Guru,
one will be wealthy.

10. Should Chandr be in Kark identical with Lagn, and be yuti with or
receiving a drishti from Buddh and Guru one will be wealthy.

11. Should Mangal be in Lagn identical with his own rashi and be yuti
with or receiving a drishti from Buddh, Shukr, and Shani, the native
will be rich.

12. Should Buddh's rashi be Lagn with Buddh there in and should Buddh
be yuti with or receiving a drishti from Shani and Guru the native will
be rich.

13. Should Guru be in Lagn identical with as own rashi and be yuti with
or receiving a drishti from Buddh and Mangal, the native will be rich.

14. If Shukr happens to be in Lagn identical with his own rashi and
be yuti with or receiving a drishti from Shani and Buddh, one will
be wealthy.

15. If Shani is in his own rashi identical with Lagn and receiving
a drishti from or being yuti with Mangal and Guru, the native will
be wealthy.

16. Other Qualified Grahas: Dharm's lord and Putr's lord are capable
of bestowing wealth. Similarly, grahas yuti with Dharm's lord and/or
Putr's lord are capable of bestowing wealth. There is no doubt that
these grahas will give wealth during their Dasha periods.

17. The Yogas mentioned above (up to sloka 16) should be delineated
after knowing favourable or unfavourable dispositions of the participant
grahas and their strength and weakness.

18-19. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of the Lords of Kendras: If
the lord of a Kendr is in Parijatamsh, the native will be liberal, if the
lord of a Kendr is in Uttamamsh the native will be highly liberal, if the
lord of a Kendr is in Gopuramsh the native will be endowed with prowess,
if the lord of a Kendr is in Simhasanamsh the native will be honourable,
(prominent, etc.), if the lord of a Kendr is in Paravatamsh the native
will be valorous, if the lord of a Kendr is in Devalokamsh the native
will be head of an assembly, if the lord of a Kendr is in Brahmalokamsh
the native will be a sage, and if the lord of Kendr is in Iravatamsh
the native will be delighted and be celebrated in all quarters.

20-22. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Putr's Lord: If Putr's
lord is in Parijatamsh, the native will take to the branch of learning
befitting his race; if Putr's lord is in Uttamamsh the native will have
excellent learning; if Putr's lord is in Gopuramsh the native will receive
world-wide honours; if Putr's lord is in Simhasanamsh the native will
become a minister; if Putr's lord is in also Paravatamsh the native will
be endowed with Vedic Knowledge; if Putr's lord is in Devalokamsh the
native will be a Karm Yogi (i.e. a performer of actions, worldly and
religious rites); if Putr's lord is in Brahmalokamsh the native will
be devoted to the Lord; and if Putr's lord is in Iravatamsh the native
will be pious. Notes: While the lords of the four Kendras are treated
in one and the same breath, Maharishi Parashar gives special importance
to Putr's and Dharm's lords individually. The effects may suitably be
understood based on the explanations given above for the lords of Kendras.

23-27. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Dharm's Lord: If Dharm's
lord is in Parijatamsh, the native will visit holy places; if Dharm's
lord is in Uttamamsh, the native has been visiting holy places in the past
births and he will do the same within this life-time; if Dharm's lord is
in Gopuramsh the native will perform sacrificial rites; if Dharm's lord
is in Simhasanamsh the native will be mighty and truthful; he will be a
conquerer of his senses and will concentrate only on the Brahman, giving
up all religions; if Dharm's lord is in Paravatamsh the native will be
the greatest of ascetics; if Dharm's lord is in Devalokamsh the native
will be an ascetic holding a cudgel (lagudi), or he will be a religious
mendicant that has renounced all mundane attachments and carrying three
long staves tied together in his right hand (Tridandin); and if Dharm's
lord is in Brahmalokamsh the native will perform Aswamedh Yagya (Horse
Sacrifice) and will attain the state of Lord Indra. If Dharm's lord is
in Iravatamsh the native will be a synonym of Dharma or virtues just as
Lord Ram and Yudhishtira (the eldest of Pandavas).

28. Lords of Kendras and Konas Related: The Kendras are known as Vishnu
Sthanas (i.e. Bhavas of Lord Vishnu), while the Konas are called LakShmi
Sthanas (i.e. Bhavas of LakShmi). If the lord of a Kendr establishes a
relationship with the lord of a Kon, a Raj Yog is obtained. (A sixth kind
of relationship can also be extended in this context to Navamsh positions
though there is no specific classic sanction for this. For example in
the case of a Makar native, Mangal in the Navamsh of Shukr, and Shukr
in the Navamsh of Mangal will confer a superior Raj Yog. This form of
relationship will be equally superior like the first 3 relationships
mentioned in the earlier paragraph).

29-34 Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Related Lords of Kendras
and Lords of Konas (as indicated in sloka 28): If the lord of a Kendr
and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as indicated in sloka 28,
happen to be in Parijatamsh, the native will be king and will protect
men; if the lord of a Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship
as indicated in sloka 28, happen to be in Uttamamsh, the native will
be an excellent king endowed with elephants, horses, chariots, etc.;
if the lord of a Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as
indicated in sloka 28, happen to be in Gopuramsh, the native will be
a tiger of kings honoured by other kings; and if the lord of a Kendr
and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as indicated in slokas
28, happen to be in Simhasanamsh the native will be an emperor ruling
over the entire earth; with the said Raj Yog relationship of the said
grahas in Simhasanamsh were born Harish Chandr, Manu, Bali, the Fire god
(Agni Deva) and many emperors. In the present Yuga so born is Yudhishtira
(or Dharm Raj of Mahabharat). Salivahana's birth and that of others will
also come with this Yog. With the lord of a Kendr and the lord of a Kon,
having a relationship as indicated in sloka 28, placed in Paravatamsh,
Manu, etc., were born. The Incarnations of Lord Vishnu took place when
the lord of a Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as
indicated in sloka 28, were placed in Devalokamsh; with the lord of a
Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as indicated in sloka
28, placed in Brahmalokamsh Lord Brahma was born; and with the lord of
a Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as indicated in
sloka 28, placed in Iravatamsh the Swayambhu Manu was born. (Manu is
the first of the 14 Manus, identified as the second creator who produced
the Prajapatis. To Manu, the code of laws, viz. Manu Smriti is ascribed) .

Chapter 42 Combinations for Penury 1. O Lord, you have stated many
Yogas related to acquisition of wealth. Please tell me such Yogas causing
utter poverty.

2. The native will be penniless if Lagn's lord is in Vyaya Bhava,
while Vyaya's lord is in Lagn along with the lord of a Marak (a death
inflicting grah) or receives a drishti from such a grah.

3. The native will be penniless if Lagn's lord is in Ari Bhava, while
Ari's lord is in Lagn, yuti with or receiving a drishti from a Marak lord.

4. Should Lagn or Chandr be with Ketu, while Lagn's lord is in Randhr
Bhava, the person concerned will be penniless.

5. If Lagn's lord along with a malefic is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya
Bhava, while Dhan's lord is in an enemy's rashi, or in debilitation,
even a native of royal scion will become penniless.

6. If Lagn's lord is yuti with the lord of Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava,
or with Shani, and if Lagn's lord is devoid of a drishti from a benefic
the native will be penniless.

7. Should Putr's and Dharm's lords be respectively found in Ari and
Vyaya Bhava, and receive a drishti from Marak grahas, the native will
be penniless.

8. If malefics, excepting the lords of Karm and Dharm Bhava, happen to
be in Lagn associated with or receiving a drishti from Marak grahas one
will become penniless.

9. Note the grahas that are ruling the rashis occupied by the lords
of Ari, Randhr, and Vyaya Bhava. If the said dispositors are in such
evil bhavas in turn, and are associated with or receive a drishti from
malefics, the native will be miserable and indigent.

10. The lord of the Navamsh occupied by Chandr, joining a Marak grah
or occupying a Marak Bhava will make one penniless.

11. Should the lord of the natal Lagn and that of the Navamsh Lagn be
yuti with or receive a drishti from Marak grahas, one will be penniless.

12. If inauspicious bhavas are occupied by benefics, while auspicious
bhavas are occupied by malefics, the native will be indigent and will
be distressed even in the matter of food.

13. A grah associated with one of the lords of Ari, Randhr, and Vyaya
Bhava, being bereft of a drishti from the lord of a Kon, will in its
Dasha periods cause harm to the native's financial aspects.

14. If the 8th/12th from Atma Karak, or Randhr/Vyaya Bhava receive a
drishti from the Atma Karak's Navamsh lord and the lord of Janma Lagn,
the native will be bereft of wealth.

15. The native will be a spend thrift if the 12th from Atma Karak
receives a drishti from the dispositor of Atma Karak or if Vyaya Bhava
receives a drishti from the lord of Lagn.

16-18. Now I tell you some Yogas for poverty along with conditions of
their nullifications. Should Mangal and Shani be together in Dhan Bhava,
the native's wealth will be destroyed. Should Buddh give a drishti to
Mangal and Shani in Dhan Bhava, there will be great wealth. There is no
doubt in it. Surya in Dhan Bhava receiving a drishti from Shani will
cause penury; while if Surya is in Dhan Bhava and does not receive a
drishti from Shani, riches and fame will be obtained. The same effects
(i.e. poverty) will be declared if Shani is in Dhan Bhava receiving a
drishti from Surya.

Chapter 43 Longevity 1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have dealt with
combinations for wealth and poverty. Kindly detail methods of ascertaining
the life span of human beings.

2-3.

0 Brahmin, for the benefit of mankind I narrate methods of
ascertaining longevity; knowing that longevity is difficult even
for gods. Many exponents have laid down various methods of longevity
calculations. Following is the summary of such schools of thoughts.

4-8. Pindayu: The grahas contribute to longevity according to their
being in exaltation, or debilitation, and also based on their strengths
and weaknesses and positions in Ashvini, etc., and in the various
rashis. First of all, Pindayu is based on the positions of the grahas. O
Brahmin, listen carefully to what I say: 19, 25, 15, 12, 15, 21, and 20
are the number of years contributed by the grahas from Surya, etc., when
in (deep) exaltation. These are half of the above in (deep) debilitation;
and if the grahas are in between exaltation and debilitation, the rule of
three process should be used. Deduct the actual position of the grah from
its deep exaltation point. If the product is less than 6 rashis, deduct
it again from 12 rashis. The product concerned should be multiplied by
the number of years allotted to the grah and divided by 12 to get the
grah's actual contribution.

9. Rectifications: Excepting Shukr and Shani, the contributions made
by others should be halved, if they are eclipsed, by Surya. One third
should be reduced if the grah is in its inimical rashi. This does not
apply to the one in retrogression (see Vakra Charam).

10-11. Deductions for Grahas in the Visible Half of the Zodiac:  
Full, half, one third, one fourth, one fifth, and one sixth are the
deductions of contributions made by malefics placed in the visible half
of the zodiac. Benefics in such cases lose only half of what malefics
lose. Should there be more than one grah in a bhava, the deduction due to
the strongest will only prevail, and not deductions due to other grahas
in that particular bhava. Waning Chandr is a benefic for this purpose.

12-13. Malefics in Lagn: In case Tanu Bhava is occupied by malefics,
adopt the following procedure: Convert Lagn's Sphuta into minutes of
arc and multiple it by the years, etc., contributed by the occupant and
divide by 21600. The years etc. so arrived be deducted from the respective
contribution which will be the net span donated by the grah. If there is
benefics drishti on Lagn containing malefics then the loss is only half
(obtained through these calculations).

14-15. Lagn's Contribution: The number of years contributed by Lagn
will correspond to the number of rashis it gained (from Mesh), while the
degrees Lagn has gained in the particular rashi will also correspondingly
donate (i.e.

30 degrees=l year). If the Lagn's lord in the Navamsh is stronger than
Lagn's lord, then the contribution should be computed only based on the
number of Navamshas gained (from Mesh), otherwise the computation will
be for the Rashi Lagn.

16-17. Nisargayu: O Brahmin, now I tell you about Nisargayu 1, 2, 9,
20, 18, 20,and 50 are the years allotted to Chandr, Mangal, Buddh, Shukr,
Guru, Surya, and Shani from the period of birth.

18-19. Amshayu: Now, I will tell you about Amshayu contributions by Lagn
and grahas. The years correspond to the number of Navamshas counted from
Mesh. Multiply the longitude in question by 108. If the product exceeds
12, expunge multiples of 12 and consider the final product in rashis,
degrees, etc., as years, months, etc..

20-22. The same reductions as per Pindayu apply to Amshayu as well;
i.e. half for a combust grah, one third for inimical placement and
the ones due for placements in the half of the zodiac counted from the
12th backwards. Some scholars suggest further corrections for Amshayu,
viz. To increase three fold the contribution of a grah in exaltation or
in own bhava and double the contribution if the contributor is in his own
Navamsh or in his own Dreshkan. If doubling and trebling is warranted,
only trebling be done. In case of reductions also, only halving is to
be done if both halving and reducing a third are required. That is how
the final life span of men be understood.

23. Longevity for Other Living Beings: For other living beings as well
such computations can be made. The said figure should be multiplied by
the figure corresponding to its full span of life and divided by the
figure corresponding to the full span of life for human beings.

24-29. Full Life Span of Various Living Beings: Now, I'll tell you about
the full life span figures for various living beings. Gods and sages
enjoy endless life span (i.e. in astronomical proportions as against
ordinary mortals). The full life span of eagles, owls, parrots, crows,
and snakes is one thousand years. For falcon, monkey, bear, and frog
the full span of life is 300 years. Demon's full life span is 150 years,
while it is 120 years for human beings.

32 years for horses.

25 years for donkeys and camels, 24 years for oxen and buffaloes,
20 years for peacocks, 16 years for goats and rams.

14 years for swans, 12 years for cuckoo, dog, and dove, 8 years for hens,
etc., and 7 years for birds, etc..

30-31. Choice of Longevity: I have narrated 3 different methods
of longevity. Listen to me about the choice among the three
systems. According to which of the three: Lagn, Surya, or Chandr is
stronger than the other two, Amshayu, Pindayu, or Nisargayu should be
respectively chosen.

32. Doubtful Cases: If two among Lagn, Surya, and Chandr gain equal
strength, then longevity should be worked out as per both systems and
the average of both (final) should be considered. If all the three are
equally strong, the average of the three should be considered.

33-40. Other Clues to Longevity: O excellent of the Brahmins, I will now
give you details of other methods in the matter of longevity as under:  
This is based on the positions of Lagn's lord, Randhr's lord, Shani,
Chandr, natal Lagn, and Hora Lagn. These six are grouped into three
groups, thus: the lords of Lagn and of Randhr Bhava on the one hand,
Shani and Chandr on the other hand, and the natal Lagn and Hora Lagn on
yet the other hand. Out of a group of two, if the two are in movable
rashis long life is denoted. One in a fixed rashi and the other in a
dual rashi will also bestow long life. One in a movable rashi and the
other in a fixed rashi will give medium life. If both are in dual rashis
then, again medium life will be obtained. Short life is denoted if one
is in a movable rashi as the other is in a dual rashi, or if both are
in fixed rashis. The type of life denoted by three or two groups be
only considered. If the three groups denote different scales, then the
one indicated by the pair of natal Lagn and Hora Lagn should be only
considered. In case of three different indications if Chandr is in Lagn
or Yuvati Bhava, then, the one indicated by the Shani-Chandr pair will
only come to pass.

41-44. Further Clarifications: If long life is denoted by all the said
three groups, the span is 120 years, if by two groups it is 108 years,
and if only by one group it is 91 years. If medium life is arrived at
by three groups it is 80 years, if medium life span is indicated by 2
groups it is 72 years, and if medium life span is indicated by one group
it is 64 years. If short life is denoted by the said three groups it is
only 32 years, if short life is indicated by two groups, the life span
is 36 years, and if short life is indicated by one group the life span
is 40 years. These are rectified as under.

45-46. Rectifications: If the contributor is in the beginning of a rashi,
his donation will be full, and it will be nil if he is at the end of a
rashi. For intermediary placements, rule of the process will apply. Add
the longitudes of the contributors (devoid of rashis) and the sum so
arrived at must be divided by the number of contributors. The latest
product should be multiplied by the number of basic years and divided
by 30. This will yield the net longevity.

47. Special Rule for Shani: Should Shani be a contributor, the class
of longevity declines. Some advocate contrarily, an increase of class
in this context. If Shani is in its own rashi or in exaltation, change
in class will not occur. Even if he receives a drishti from or is yuti
with only a malefic, no change occurs.

48. Special Rule for Guru: If Guru is in Lagn or in Yuvati Bhava,
and receives a drishti from or is yuti with only benefics, the class of
longevity will increase.

49-50. Increase and Fall in Class of Longevity: From very short life
to short life, from short life to medium life, from medium life to long
life and from long life to extremely long life are the increases in the
classification of longevity when Guru warrants an increase. The reverse
is true if Shani warrants a fall in the span of life.

51. (Maitreya says): You have narrated various kinds of longevity
computations. Please favour me by denoting subtle classes there of and
poor and long life spans.

52. (Maharishi Parashar replies): These are seven-fold, viz. Bal Risht,
Yog Risht, short, medium, long, super-natural (Divya), and immortality
(Amritayu).

53-54. The life span in Bal Risht is 8 years, in Yog Risht 20
years; in short, medium, and long lives respectively 32, 64, and 120
years. Super-natural life span is 1000 years. Above this super-natural
life span of 1000 years it is Amritayu, which can be acquired only by
those who deserve it (Merits).

55. Limitless Longevity: Should Kark be Lagn with Guru and Chandr there
in, while Shukr and Buddh are in Kendras, and others are in Sahaj, Ari,
and Labh Bhava, the native will obtain limitless longevity.

56. Super-natural Longevity: One having benefics in Kendras and/or Konas,
while malefics are in Sahaj, Ari, and Labh Bhava will obtain super-natural
life span (one thousand years). Randhr Bhava in this case should be one
of the rashis owned by a benefic.

57. Living until the End of the Yuga: One born in Kark Lagn will live
till the end of the yuga if Guru is in a Kendr and happens to be in
Gopuramsh, while Shukr is in a Kon and happens to be in Paravatamsh.

58. Living the Life Span of a Sage: Guru in Simhasanamsh being in Lagn,
Shani in Devalokamsh, and Mangal in Paravatamsh; if these are so, one
will enjoy the life span as due to a sage.

59. Good Yogas increase the life span and bad Yogas decrease the same
(as arrived by mathematical means). Hence, I tell you such Yogas as to
know of full, medium, and short span combinations.

60. If a Kendr contains a benefic, while Lagn's lord is yuti with or
receives a drishti from a benefic, or Guru in particular, the native
will live a full span of life.

61. Should Lagn's lord be in a Kendr yuti with or receiving a drishti
from Guru and Shukr, full life span will result.

62. If at birth three grahas are exalted, out of which the lords,
of Lagn and Randhr Bhava are inclusive, as Randhr Bhava is devoid of a
malefic in it, full life span will result.

63. Long life is denoted if three grahas are in Randhr Bhava, in
exaltation, own or friendly divisions, while Lagn's lord is strong.

64. If Shani or Lagn's lord is yuti with any exalted grah, long life
will result.

65. Long life will be enjoyed if malefics are in Sahaj, Ari, and Labh
Bhava, while benefics are in Kendras.

66. If Ari, Yuvati, and Randhr Bhava are occupied by benefics, while
malefics are in Sahaj and Labh Bhava, full life span will follow the
birth.

67. If Randhr's lord is friendly to Surya, while malefics are in Ari
and Vyaya Bhava, as Lagn's lord is in a Kendr, the native will live the
full span of life.

68.

0 excellent of the Brahmins, if a malefic is in Randhr Bhava, while
Karm's lord is exalted, one will be long lived.

69. Long life will follow if Lagn is a dual rashi, while Lagn's lord
is in a Kendr, or in exaltation, or in a Kon.

70. Should Lagn be a dual rashi, while two malefics are in a Kendr with
reference to a strong Lagn's lord, long life is indicated.

71-73. If the stronger among Lagn's lord and Randhr's lord is placed
in a Kendr long life is indicated; and if in a Panaphara (Dhan, Putr,
Randhr, or Labh Bhava) medium life is indicated; If the stronger among
Lagn's lord and Randhr's lord is placed in Apoklima (Sahaj, Ari, Dharm,
or Vyaya Bhava) short life will come to pass. According to Lagn's lord
being friendly, neutral, or inimical to Surya, long, medium, or short
life will result.

74. Should Mangal and Sahaj's lord, or Randhr's lord and Shani, be
combust or (two of either pair) be yuti with malefics or receive a
drishti from malefics, there will be short life.

75. If Lagn's lord is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava yuti with malefics
and devoid of yuti with and/or drishti from a benefic, short life will
come to pass.

76. If malefics are in Kendras devoid of yuti with or a drishti from
benefics, while Lagn's lord is not strong, only short life will result.

77.

0 excellent of Brahmins, if Vyaya and Dhan Bhava are occupied by malefics
and devoid of a drishti from a benefic or devoid of yuti with a benefic,
the native will be short-lived.

78. If the lords of Lagn and Randhr Bhava are bereft of dignities and
strength, short life will come to pass. If the lords of Lagn and Randhr
Bhava are helped by others, while being so, medium life span will come
to pass.

Chapter 44 Marak (Killer) Grahas 1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have
mentioned a lot about longevity. Be kind enough to throw light on Marakas
or killers.

2-5.

0 Brahmin, Sahaj and Randhr Bhava are the two bhavas of longevity. The
bhavas related to death are the 12th from each of these, i.e. Dhan and
Yuvati Bhava are Marak Bhavas.

3. Out of the two (i.e. Dhan and Yuvati Bhava), Dhan Bhava is a powerful
Marak Bhava (as against Yuvati Bhava). The lords of Dhan and Yuvati Bhava,
malefics in Dhan and Yuvati Bhava, and malefics yuti with Dhan's lord
and yuti with Yuvati's lord, are all known as Marakas. The major and
sub periods of these grahas will bring death on the native depending on
whether he has a long life, medium life, or short life person.

6-7. The Dasha of a benefic grah related to Vyaya's lord may also inflict
death. End may descend on the native in Randhr's lord's Dasha. The Dasha
of a grah which is an exclusive malefic (i.e. first-rate malefic) may
also cause death.

9. Should Shani be ill-disposed and be related to a Marak grah, he will
be the first to kill in preference to other grahas.

10-14.

0 Brahmin, I tell you further about Marakas. Narrated earlier are three
kinds of life spans, viz. short, medium, and long. Short life is before
32 years, later on up to 64 it is medium life, and from 64 to 100 it
is long life. Beyond 100 the longevity is called supreme. O excellent
of the Brahmins, it is impossible to decide upon longevity till the
native is 20 years old. Till such year the child should be protected by
sacred recitations, religious offerings (of ghee, etc., to consecrated
fire as prescribed in the Vedas, etc., and through medical treatments,
for premature death may descend on the child due to sins of father and
mother or of its own (in the previous birth).

15-21. I further mention about the Marak grahas. One born with short
life combinations may face death in the Dasha denoted by Vipat star (the
3rd from the birth star); one of medium life may die in the Dasha denoted
by Pratyak star (the 5th from the birth star). In the Dasha denoted by
Vadh star (the 7th from the birth star), one with long life may obtain
his end. The Dasha of the lord of the 22nd Dreshkan, or the Dasha of the
lord of the 23rd, or the Dasha of the lord of the 3rd, or the Dasha of
the lord of the 5th, or the Dasha of the lord of the 7th asterisms may
also cause death. The lords of the 2nd and the 12th counted from Kark
may bring death, this is true when Chandr is a malefic; if he happens
to be a benefic there will be (only) diseases (but not death). Death
may come to pass in the Dasha of Ari's lord and in the sub periods of
Ari's, Randhr's, and/or Vyaya's lords. Should there be many Marakas
(endowed with the power of killing),and if these Marakas are strong,
there will be diseases, miseries, etc., in major and sub periods. Thus,
these are Marakas (as is mentioned above) and are primarily related to
bring death upon the native. According to their dispositions there may
be death or difficulties.

22-24. Rahu and Ketu as Marakas: If Rahu or Ketu are placed in Tanu,
Yuvati, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, or happen to be in the 7th from a Marak
lord, or are placed with such a grah, they acquire powers of killing
in their major or sub periods. For one born in Makar, or in Vrischik,
Rahu will be a Marak. Should Rahu be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava,
he will give difficulties in his Dasha periods. He will not, however,
do so if Rahu receives a drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic.

25-31. Sahaj Bhava and Death: O excellent of Brahmins, if Surya, being
with strength, is in Sahaj Bhava, one will obtain his death due to a king
(or legal punishments); Chandr in Sahaj Bhava will cause death due to
tuberculosis, while wounds, weapons, fire, and thirst will cause death
through Mangal in Sahaj Bhava. If Sahaj Bhava receives a drishti from,
or is occupied by Shani and Rahu, death will be through poison, water,
or fire, or fall from heights, or confinement. Death will surely come to
descend through insects or leprosy if Chandr and Gulik occupy or give
a drishti to Sahaj Bhava. Buddh giving a drishti to or occupying Sahaj
Bhava will bring death followed by fever. Guru in Sahaj Bhava or giving a
drishti to Sahaj Bhava will cause death by swelling or tumours. Urinary
diseases will cause death if Shukr is in, or gives a drishti to Sahaj
Bhava. Many grahas giving a drishti to or occupying Sahaj Bhava will
bring death through many diseases.

32, If Sahaj Bhava is occupied by a benefic, death will be in an
auspicious place (like a shrine); and if Sahaj Bhava is occupied by a
malefic death will be in sinful places. Mixed occupation of Sahaj Bhava
will yield mixed results with regard to the place of death.

33. Consciousness will prevail at the time of death if Guru or Shukr
are placed in Sahaj Bhava. With other grahas in Sahaj Bhava, there will
be unconsciousness before death.

34. According to Sahaj Bhava being a movable, a fixed, or a dual rashi,
death will be respectively in a foreign place (other than native birth
place), in one's own house, or on the way.

35-36: Occupants of Randhr Bhava: Note the occupant of Randhr Bhava: If
it is Surya, death will be through fire; if Chandr is in Randhr Bhava,
death will be through water; if Mangal is in Randhr Bhava, death will
be through weapons; if Buddh is in Randhr Bhava, death will be through
fever; if Guru is in Randhr Bhava, death will be through diseases; if
Shukr is in Randhr Bhava, death will be through hunger; and if Shani is
in Randhr Bhava, death will be through thirst.

37. If Randhr Bhava is occupied by or receives a drishti from a benefic,
while Dharm's lord is yuti with a benefic the native will die in a
shrine. If Randhr Bhava is occupied by or receives a drishti from a
malefic, while Dharm's lord is yuti with a malefic, death will be in a
place other than a shrine.

38-39. Fate of the Human Physical System: Should there be a benefic's
Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava (i.e. the 22nd Dreshkan), the body will be burnt
in fire (as prescribed in Shastras); if a malefic's Dreshkan happens
to be in Randhr Bhava, the body will be thrown away in water; if the
Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava is owned by a mixed grah the dead body will
only dry up; if the Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava is a serpent Dreshkan, the
body will be eaten away by animals, crows, etc.; 40. Serpent Dreshkanas:  
The 2nd and 3rd Dreshkan in Kark, the initial one in Vrischik, and the
last one in Meen are designated as serpent Dreshkanas.

41-42. Pre-natal Abode: O excellent of Brahmins, the stronger of the
two luminaries, Surya and Chandr, occupying a Dreshkan of Guru denotes
the descent from the world of gods. If the stronger of the luminaries,
Surya and Chandr, occupies the Dreshkan of Shukr or Chandr, the descent
is from the world of the Manes; if the stronger of the two luminaries,
Surya and Chandr, is in the Dreshkan of Surya or Mangal, the descent is
from the world of Yama (the world of the death); and if the stronger of
the two luminaries, Surya and Chandr, is in Dreshkan of Buddh or Shani,
the descent is from the hell.

43-45. Ascent after Death: According to the following grahas in Vyaya,
Yuvati, Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will attain one of the different
worlds after death: Guru: heaven; Chandr or Shukr: the world of Manes;
Mangal and/or Surya: earth (i.e. rebirth); Buddh and/or Shani: hell. In
case the said bhavas are not occupied, the native will go to the world
indicated by the stronger of the Dreshkan lords related to Ari and Randhr
Bhava. The relative grah's exaltation, etc., will denote the high, medium,
and low status the native will obtain in the said world. world of Yama
(the world of the death); and if the stronger of the two luminaries,
Surya and Chandr, is in Dreshkan of Buddh or Shani, the descent is from
the hell.

43-45. Ascent after Death: According to the following grahas in Vyaya,
Yuvati, Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will attain one of the different
worlds after death: Guru: heaven; Chandr or Shukr: the world of Manes;
Mangal and/or Surya: earth (i.e. rebirth); Buddh and/or Shani: hell. In
case the said bhavas are not occupied, the native will go to the world
indicated by the stronger of the Dreshkan lords related to Ari and
Randhr Bhava. The relative grah's exaltation, etc., will denote the high,
medium, and low status the native will obtain in the said world.

46. Other grahas and rashis becoming Marakas are being discussed in
the chapter related to Dashas.

<HR>

Chapter 45 Avasthas of Grahas 1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have earlier
stated that the Avasthas, or states, of the grahas are to be considered
in the context of the effects of the grahas. Be so kind to tell me
about this.

2.  0 excellent of Brahmins, various kinds of Avasthas of the grahas
have been expounded. Out of these, I will give you the summary of BAl
(infant) and other states of the grahas (in the first instance).

3. BAl, Kumar, Yuv, Vriddh, and Mrit Avastha: Infant, youthful,
adolescent, old, and dead are the states of the grahas placed in the
ascending order at the rate of six degrees in odd rashis. In the case of
even rashis this arrangement is in reverse order. (These five Avasthas
are known as BAl Adi Avasthas. For odd rashis, the placement concerned
will denote the Avastha as under: BAl Avastha (Infant state): O to
6 degrees Kumar Avastha (Youthful state): 6 to 12 degrees Yuv Avastha
(Adolescent state): 12 to 18 degrees Vriddh Avastha (Advanced state):  
18 to 24 degrees Mrit Avastha (In extremis): 24 to 30 degrees The above
order is to be reversed for placement in an even rashi).

4. Results: One fourth, half, full, negligible, and nil are the grades
of the results due to a grah in infant, youthful, adolescent, old,
and dead Avasthas.

5. Awakening, Dreaming, and Sleeping States: If a grah is in its own
rashi, or in exaltation it is said to be in a state of awakening (or
alertness). In the rashi of a friend or of a neutral rashi, it is in
dreaming state, while in an enemy's rashi, or in debilitation it is in
a state of sleeping.

6. According to a grah being in Awakening, Dreaming or Sleeping states,
the results due to it will be full, medium, or nil.

7. Other Kinds of States: There are nine kinds of other Avasthas,
viz. Dipt, Swasth, Pramudit, Shanta, Din, Vikal, Khal, and Kop.

8-10. If a grah is in its exaltation rashi, it is in Dipt Avastha;
if a grah is in its own rashi, it is in Swasth Avastha, if a grah is
in a great friend's rashi, it is in Pramudit Avastha; if a grah is in a
friendly rashi, it is in Shanta Avastha; if a grah is in a neutral rashi,
it is in Din Avastha; if a grah is yuti with a malefic, it is in Vikal
Avastha; if a grah is in an enemy's rashi, it is in Duhkhit Avastha; if a
grah is in a great enemy's rashi it is in Khal Avastha; and if a grah is
being eclipsed by Surya, it is in Kop Avastha. Depending on such a state
of the grah, the bhava occupied by it will obtain corresponding effects.

8. Yet Other Avasthas: Lajjit, Garvit, Kshudhit, Trushit, Mudit, and
Kshobhit are the (six) other kinds of Avasthas due to the grahas. Placed
in Putr Bhava, if a grah is associated with Rahu or Ketu, or with Surya,
Shani, or Mangal, it is in Lajjit Avastha. If a grah is in exaltation or
in Mooltrikon, it is Gavit Avastha. If a grah is in an enemy's rashi,
or yuti with an enemy, or receives a drishti from an enemy, or even
if a grah is yuti with Shani, the Avastha is Kshudhit. If a grah is
in a watery rashi and receives a drishti from a malefic but does not
receive a drishti from a benefic, the Avastha is called Trushit. If a
grah is in a friendly rashi, or is yuti with, or receives a drishti from
a benefic, or is yuti with Guru, it is said to be in Mudit Avastha. If
a grah is yuti with Surya and receives a drishti from, or is yuti with
a malefic, or receives a drishti from an enemy, it is said to be in
Kshobhit Avastha. The bhavas occupied by a grah in Kshudhit Avastha or
in Kshobhit Avastha are destroyed.

19-23. The learned should estimate the effects due to a bhava in the
manner cited above (i.e. with the help of various kinds of Avasthas),
after ascertaining the strength and weakness (of the various grahas). Weak
grahas cause reduction in good effects ,while stronger ones give greater
effects. If a grah posited in Karm Bhava is in Lajjit Avastha, in Kshudhit
Avastha, or in Kshobhit Avastha, the person will always be subjected to
miseries. If a grah in Putr Bhava is in Lajjit Avastha, there will be
destruction of progeny, or there will be only one surviving child. Surely
the wife of the native will die if there is a grah in Yuvati Bhava in
Kshobhit Avastha or in Trushit Avastha.

24-29. Effects of Garvit, Mudit, Lajjit, Kshobhit, Kshudhit, and Trushit
Avastha: A grah in Garvit Avastha will cause happiness through new houses
and gardens, regalhood, skill in arts, financial gains at all times, and
improvement in business. A grah in Mudit Avastha will give residences,
clothes, ornaments, happiness from lands and wife, happiness from
relatives, living in royal places, destruction of enemies, and acquisition
of wisdom and learning. A grah in Lajjit Avastha will give aversion to
God, loss of intelligence, loss of child, interest in evil speeches,
and listlessness in good things. A grah in Kshobhit Avastha will give
acute penury, evil disposition, miseries, financial debacles, distress
to feet and obstruction to income due to royal wrath. A grah in Kshudhit
Avastha will cause downfall due to grief and passion, grief on account of
relatives, physical decline, troubles from enemies, financial distress,
loss of physical strength and an eclipsed mind due to miseries. A grah
in Trushit Avastha will cause diseases through association with females,
leading over wicked (or evil) deeds, loss of wealth due to ones own men,
physical weakness, miseries caused by evil people, and decline of honour.

30-37. Calculation of Shayan and Other Avasthas: Now, I will tell you of
the Avasthas viz. Shayan, Upavesan, Netrapani, Prakash, Gaman, Agaman,
Sabh, Agam, Bhojan, Nritya Lips, Kautuk, and Nidr, and the Chesthas of
such Avasthas. Note the number of the stars (from Ashvini) occupied by
the grah for which an Avastha is to be calculated. Multiply that number
by the number denoted by the grah (Surya 1, Chandr 2, Mangal 3, Buddh 4,
Guru 5, Shukr 6, and Shani 7). The figure so arrived at should again be
multiplied by the number of the Navamsh where the grah is in. Add to
this the number of the birth asterism, the number of ghatis of birth,
and the number of rashis Lagn gained from Mesh. This figure should be
divided by 12 and the remainder will indicate the corresponding Avastha
of the grah. The sub state in the said Avastha can be found out in the
following way: Multiply the figure denoted by the Avastha concerned
(i.e. Sayan 1, Upavesan 2, Netrapani 3, Prakash 4, Gaman 5, Agaman 6,
Sabh 7, Agam 8, Bhojan 9, Nritya Lips 10, Kautuk 11, and Nidr 12) by the
same figure and increase it by the figure denoted by the Anka value for
the first syllable of the native's personal name. Divide the product
so obtained by 12. The remainder there of should be further increased
by constant additives of the Buddh 3, Guru 5, Shukr 3, Shani 3, Rahu 4
(and Ketu 4). (Here the grah means the one for whom the sub state is
being known.) The product so arrived at should be divided by 3. In the
process of calculation if it happens that the remainder is 1, it is
Drishti, if the remainder is 2, it is Chesht, and if the remainder is
0, it is Vichesht. Notes: So far narrated are three different groups of
Avasthas. The present Avasthas are called Shayan Adi Avasthas. These are
of supreme importance as compared to the other kinds of Avasthas.. The
following formula may be adopted to know about the grah's Avastha (Sayan
Adi) at birth: (s x p x n) + (a + g + r) ------------------------- =
Avastha 12 Where as s denotes the serial number of the star occupied by
the grah, counted from Ashvini at birth; p denotes the status of the
grah counted from Surya (i.e. Surya 1, Chandr 2, Mangal 3, Buddh 4,
Guru 5, Shukr 6, Shani 7); n denotes the grah's Navamsh position (i.e.

1 to 9 Navamshas); 'a' denotes Janm NakShatr (or ruling star, i.e. the
one occupied by Chandr); 'g' denotes the ghati in which birth took place
(i. e.

20 ghatis 2 vighatis is 21 ghatis); and 'r' denotes Lagn 's order counted
from Mesh (i.e. Mesh 1, Vrishabh 2, Kark 4, Simh 5, and so on and so
forth). In place of n given above, some translators interpret the word
Amsh as degree occupied by the grah which is obviously not correct. In
this connection, the reader's attention is drawn to Balabhadr's Hora
Ratna, ch 3 wherein the author Balabhadr himself gives an example for
Surya being in the 7th Navamsh of Simh and thus he considered only
7 as multiplier. He has not taken in to account Surya's degree. He
quotes Adhibhut Sagara as his authority for calculation of Sayan Adi
Avasthas. It will thus be clear that Amsh is Navamsh and not degree
in this context. Also please note that Agaman Avastha (the 6th one)
is known as Gamanechch Avastha by some exponents. Take a case now as an
example with the following data: Surya in Kritika NakShatr, 3rd Navamsh
of Vrishabh (i.e. in 7 degrees 12' Vrishabh), the birth star is Kritika,
birth is at 30 ghatis 33 vighatis, and Lagn is in Vrischik. With these we
produce the following information, keeping the formula given above. s =
3, p = 1, n = 3; a = 3, g = 31, r = 8. Hence to find out the Avastha,
(3 x 1 x 3) + (3 + 31 + 8) 51 -+- ----------------------- ---- 12 12
With the help of remainder 3, we count three Avasthas from Sayan. This
indicates Netrapani Avastha for Surya. Similarly, for 9 grahas, such
Avasthas can be found out. In a given horoscope, the factors a, g, and r
will be identical for all the 9 grahas, while factors s, p, and n will be
variable. After knowing the Avasthas of various grahas, we have to find
out the sub-state of each Avastha. The formula for knowing the sub-state
is made in two stages, as under: Stage 1: (A x A) + fs ------------ =
R 12 Stage 2: (R + pa) : 3 = sub-state of an Avastha Where A is Avastha,
f is first syllable's value with reference to the native's personal name,
R is remainder in stage 1, and pa is the additives of the grah denoted
in the above slokas, such as Surya 5, Shukr 3, etc.. The remainder at
stage 2 will denote the sub-state such as 1 is Drishti, 2 is Chesht, and
0 is Vichesht. We need information about the Anka value, or value for the
first syllable of the name of a person. This value is: 1 for a, ka, cha,
da (retroflex), and va; 2 for i, kha, ja, da (dental), and sha; 3 for u,
ga, jha, ta (dental), pa, ya, and sha; 4 for e, gha, ta (retroflex), tha
(dental), pha, ra, and ma; 5 for o, ca, tha (retroflex), da (dental), and
ha. Now with the above data, find the sub-state for Surya in Netrapani
Avastha as per the example given supra. First syllable of the name is
Sa. Hence, (3 x 3) + 4 Stage 1: ---------- = Remainder 1 12 (1 + 5)
Stage 2: ------- = 0 3 Remainder zero indicates sub-state as Vichesht,
in Netrapani Avastha.

38-39. Effects of Chesht, etc. : If the sub-state is Drishti in an
Avastha, the results being stated for the Avastha will be medium; the
effects will be full in Chesht, and negligible in Vichesht. The good
and bad effects of grahas should be deciphered based on the strength
and weakness of the grahas. In exaltation, the grahas reveal effects in
a pronounced manner due to (good) Avasthas.

40-51. Effects of Surya's Avasthas at Birth: If Surya is in Sayan
Avastha, the native will incur digestive deficiency, many diseases,
stoutness of legs, bilious vitiation, ulcer in the anus, and heart
strokes. If Surya is in Upavesan Avastha, the native will suffer poverty,
will carry loads, will indulge in litigations, be hard-hearted, wicked,
and will lose in his undertakings. If Surya is in Netrapani Avastha,
the native will always be happy, wise, helpful to others, endowed with
prowess, and wealth, very happy, and will gain royal favours. If Surya
is in Prakash Avastha, the native will be liberal in disposition, will
have plenty of wealth, will be a significant speaker in the assembly,
will perform many meritorious acts, will be greatly strong, and will be
endowed with charming beauty. If Surya is in Gaman Avastha the native will
be disposed to live in foreign places; he will be miserable, indolent,
bereft of intelligence and wealth; he will be distressed due to fear
and he will be short-tempered. If Surya is in Agaman Avastha, the native
will be interested in others' wives; he will be devoid of his own men,
he will be interested in movements and skilful in doing evil deeds; he
will be dirty, ill-disposed and he will be a tale bearer. If Surya is
in Sabh Avastha, the native will be disposed to help others; he will be
always endowed with wealth and gems; he will be virtuous, endowed with
lands, new houses and robes; he will be very strong, very affectionate
to his friends, and very kindly disposed. If Surya is in Agam Avastha,
the native will be distressed due to enemies, fickle-minded, evil-minded,
emaciated, devoid of virtuous acts and intoxicated with pride. If Surya
is in Bhojan Avastha, the native will experience pains in joints; he
will lose money on account of others' females, he will have strength
declining off and on; he will be untruthful, will incur head-aches,
will eat remnant food, and will take to bad ways. If Surya is in Nritya
Lips Avastha, the native will be honoured by the learned; he will be a
scholar, will have knowledge of poetry, etc., and he will be adored by
kings on the earth. If Surya is in Kautuk Avastha, the native will always
be happy; he will be endowed with Vedic Knowledge and he will perform
Yagyas; he will move amidst kings, will have fear from enemies; he will
be charming-faced and he will be endowed with knowledge of poetry. If
Surya is in Nidr Avastha, the native will have a strong tendency towards
being drowsy; he will live in foreign (or distant) places; he will incur
harm to his wife and will face financial destruction. Surya in Upavesan
Avastha will make one an artisan, black in complexion, devoid of learning
and miserable. One will serve others. In Netrapani Avastha there will
be all kinds of happiness, if Surya is in Putr, Dharm, Karm, or Yuvati
Bhava. In other bhavas (i.e. not in Putr, Dharm, Karm, or Yuvati Bhava),
Netrapani Avastha of Surya will give eye diseases and enmity with all. If
Surya is in Prakash Avastha, the native will be meritorious, religious,
and liberal; he will enjoy pleasures, will be equal to a prince, and will
enjoy the status of Kuber, the God of wealth. However, the Prakash Avastha
of Surya placed in Yuvati, or Putr Bhava will cause loss of the first
child and will produce many litigations. If Surya is in Gaman Avastha,
the native will incur disease of the feet and he will be very mean. If in
Agaman Avastha, Surya in Vyaya or in Yuvati Bhava will destroy progeny
and will give very limited wealth. If in Agam Avastha, Surya will give
many miseries, an ugly appearance, and foolishness. However, he will give
wealth. Surya in Bhojan Avastha in Dharm Bhava will cause many hindrances
to spiritual and religious undertakings. In other bhavas (i.e. other than
Dharm Bhava), Surya in Bhojan Avastha will cause head and ear diseases,
apart from joint pains. Though Maharishi Parashar states that the native
with Surya in Kautuk Avastha will have fear from enemies Bal Bhadr exempts
such evil effect for the Ari Bhava position. Surya in Kautuk Avastha in
other bhavas (i.e. not in Ari Bhava), will give a number of daughters, two
wives, itch, excellence, liberality, etc.. If Surya is in Nidr Avastha,
the native will be predisposed to incur piles and elephantiasis; he will
experience a lack of peace; and he will be liable to lose his first child.

52-63. Effects of Chandr's Avasthas at Birth: If Chandr is in Sayan
Avastha, the native will be honourable, sluggish, given to sexual lust,
and he will face financial destruction. If Chandr is in Upavesan Avastha,
the native will be troubled by diseases, he will be dull-witted, not
endowed with mentionable wealth (i.e. will have only negligible wealth);
he will be hard-hearted, will do unworthy acts, and will steal others'
wealth. If Chandr is in Netrapani Avastha, the native will be troubled
by great diseases (long lasting in nature), be very garrulous, wicked,
and he will indulge in bad deeds. Should Chandr be in Prakash Avastha,
the native will be famous in the world, he will have his virtues exposed
through royal patronage; he will be surrounded by horses, elephants,
females, and ornaments; he will visit shrines. If Chandr is in Gaman
Avastha, with decreasing rays the native will be sinful, cruel, and
always troubled by afflictions of sight; if Chandr is in Gaman Avastha
with increasing rays, the native will be distressed due to fear. If
Chandr is in Agaman Avastha, the native will be honourable; he will
suffer diseases of the feet; he will secretly indulge in sinful acts; he
will be poor and devoid of intelligence and happiness. If Chandr is in
Sabh Avastha, the native will be eminent among men, honoured by kings,
and kings of kings; he will be very beautiful, will subdue the passion
of women and he will be skilful in sexual acts; he will be virtuous. If
Chandr is in Agam Avastha, the native will be garrulous, and virtuous and
if the said Chandr is of dark fortnight the native will have two wives;
he will be sick, highly wicked, and he will be violent. If Chandr is
in Bhojan Avastha, the native will be endowed with honour, conveyances,
attendants, social status, wife and daughters, provided Chandr is Full
'Purna Chandr'; if Chandr is in Bhojan Avastha and is of dark fortnight
auspicious effects (i.e. honour, conveyances, attendants, social status,
wife and daughters) will fail to come. If Chandr is in Nritya Lips Avastha
and is endowed with (fort nightly) strength, the native will be strong,
he will have knowledge of songs, and he will be a critic of beauty
of things. If Chandr is in Nritya Lips Avastha and of dark fortnight,
i.e. not endowed with strength, the person will be sinful. If Chandr is
in Kautuk Avastha, the native will attain kinship, lordship over wealth,
and skill in sexual acts and in sporting with harlots. Should waxing
Chandr being yuti with Guru be in Nidr Avastha, the native will be quite
eminent. If waxing Chandr is in Nidr Avastha but devoid of Guru's yuti,
the native will lose his wealth on account of females, and female jackals
will be crying around his abode (as though it were a cemetery).

64-75. Effects of the Avasthas of Mangal at Birth: If Mangal is in
Sayan Avastha, the native will be troubled by wounds, itch, and ulcer. If
Mangal is placed in Upavesan Avastha,the native will be strong, sinful,
untruthful, eminent, wealthy, and bereft of virtues. If Mangal is placed
in Lagn and happen to be in Netrapani Avastha there will be penury; if
Mangal is placed in other bhavas (i.e. in one of the bhavas other than
Tanu Bhava), Netrapani Avastha will confer rulership of a city. Should
Mangal be in Prakash Avastha, the native will shine with virtues and will
be honoured by the king. Mangal in Prakash Avastha in Putr Bhava will,
cause loss of children and of wife. If Mangal is in Prakash Avastha
in Putr Bhava and happens to be there with Rahu, a severe (positional)
fall will descend on the native. Should Mangal be in Gaman Avastha the
native will be always roaming, will have fear of multiple ulcers, will
incur misunderstandings with females, will be afflicted by boils, itches,
etc., and will incur financial decline. If Mangal happens to be in Agaman
Avastha, the native will be virtuous, endowed with precious gems, will
adore a sharp sword, will walk with the (majestic) gait of an elephant
(imparting surprise in the onlooker), will destroy his enemies, and will
remove the miseries of his people. If Mangal is placed in Sabh Avastha
and happens to be in exaltation the native will be skilful in conducting
wars, will hold the flag of righteousness aloft, and will be wealthy; if
Mangal happens to be in Sabh Avastha in Putr, or Dharm Bhava, the native
will be bereft of learning; if Mangal is in Sabh Avastha in Vyaya Bhava
childlessness and no wife and no friends will result; and if Mangal is
in other bhavas (i.e. other than Putr, Dharm, and Vyaya Bhava), in Sabh
Avastha, the native will be a scholar in a king's court (i.e. be a poet
laureate), be very wealthy, honourable, and charitable. If Mangal is in
Agam Avastha, the native will be devoid of virtues and good deeds, will
be distressed by diseases, will acquire diseases of the root of the ears
('Karan Mularogam' and 'Padamulam Urumulam', etc.), and severe gout pains;
he will be timid and will befriend evil lot. If Mangal is with strength,
while in Bhojan Avastha, the native will eat sweet-food; if Mangal is
devoid of strength, while in Bhojan Avastha, the native will indulge in
base acts and be dishonourable. If Mangal is in Nritya Lips Avastha, the
native will earn wealth through the king and will be endowed with fullness
of gold, diamonds, and corals in his house. If Mangal is in Kautuk
Avastha the native will be curious in disposition and will be endowed
with friends and sons; if Mangal is in Kautuk Avastha and simultaneously
exalted, the native will be honoured by the king and the virtuous and he
will be virtuous himself. If Mangal is in Nidr Avastha, the native will
be short-tempered, devoid of intelligence and wealth; he will be wicked,
fallen from virtuous path, and troubled by diseases. Should Mangal be in
Upavesan Avastha in Lagn, the native will be extremely sinful, and he will
incur several diseases; he will be indigent and not peaceful. If Upavesan
Avastha occurs for Mangal in Dharm Bhava, the native will lose his whole
wealth apart from his wife and progeny. Mangal in Netrapani Avastha in
Lagn will give poverty and will destroy the native's wife and progeny; If
Mangal is in Netrapani Avastha in other bhavas (i.e. in bhavas other than
Tanu Bhava), this confers on the native all kinds of wealth and happiness
from wife and children. The Dhan Bhava position or Yuvati Bhava position
of Mangal in Netrapani Avastha will cause fear from lions and snakes,
apart from giving earnings from lands. Furthermore, the native's wife
will predecease him. Should Mangal be in Prakash Avastha in Putr or in
Yuvati Bhava, the native will lose his wife and all children. If Mangal
is placed in Putr Bhava in Prakash Avastha, and is yuti with Shani,
the native will kill cows. Should Mangal be in Gaman Avastha in Lagn,
the native will be active in his assignments, will incur diseases of
the joins, burning pains in the eyes, and will obtain dental afflictions
and the like; he will have fear from dogs and will adore the guise of a
female. In other bhavas, other than Tanu Bhava, Mangal in Gaman Avastha
will bring royal favours, leadership ,and luxuries of life. Mangal in
Agaman Avastha will cause piles and diseases of the rectum. If Mangal
is in Bhojan Avastha or in Sayan Avastha in Putr Bhava, or in Randhr
Bhava, there will be untimely death for the native. In other bhavas,
other than Putr and Randhr Bhava, Bhojan Avastha of Mangal will confer
wealth. Should Mangal be in Nritya Lips Avastha and happens to be in
Lagn, Dhan, Yuvati, or Karm Bhava, the native will receive all kinds of
happiness; there will be miseries in abundance if Mangal is in Nritya
Lips Avastha and placed in Randhr or Dharm Bhava, apart from incurring
untimely death. In other bhavas (i.e. Sahaj, Bandhu, Putr, Ari, Labh,
or Vyaya Bhava), Nritya Lips Avastha of Mangal will make the native
akin to Kuber. Mangal in Yuvati or in Dharm Bhava in Kautuk Avastha
will give several diseases and death of the first child and wife. In
other bhavas (i.e. not in Yuvati or Dharm Bhava), Kautuk Avastha will
confer scholarship, various kinds of wealth, two wives, and more female
children. In Nidr Avastha, Mangal in Lagn, Dhan, Sahaj, Dharm, Karm,
or Labh Bhava will give scholarship, foolishness, and poverty. Putr or
Yuvati Bhava placement of Mangal in Nidr Avastha will give many miseries
and many male children. Should Rahu join Mangal in Nidr Avastha in any
bhava the native will have many wives, be miserable, and will suffer
from some diseases on the surface of the feet.

scholarship; if Buddh in Nritya Lips Avastha is in a malefic's rashi
the native will be addicted to prostitutes and will long for licentious
pleasures. If Buddh is in Kautuk Avastha in Lagn, the native will be
skilful in music; if Buddh is in Yuvati or Randhr Bhava with Kautuk
Avastha the native will be addicted to courtezans; and if Buddh in Kautuk
