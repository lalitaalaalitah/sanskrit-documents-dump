कल्पान्ते मधुकैटभासुरपराभूतस्य धातुः स्तवैः
प्रीता पङ्कजलोचनस्य नयनान्निर्गत्य निद्रामयी ।
तौ युद्धे परिमोह्य घातितवती तेनैव विश्वेश्वरी
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ १॥

Being pleased by the praises sung by Brahma who was troubled
by the asuras Madhu and Kaitabha at the end of a kalpa, She,
the supreme Devi, supporter of the worlds, emerged out of
MahaVishnu's eyes, who was in mystic slumber. Deluded by
Mahamaya, the evil asuras, Madhu and Kaitabha, were then slayed
by MahaVishnu. Let Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop
the terrible army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

त्रैलोक्ये महिषासुरप्रमथिते सम्भूय संचिन्ततां
देवानामपि सा विनिर्मितवपुस्तैर्दत्तभूषायुधा ।
उच्चैर्नादयुतैर्महासुरबलैरारब्धयुद्धोत्सवा
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ २॥

When Mahishasura was creating havoc in all the three worlds,
the devas got together and requested Brahma, Siva and Vishnu
for help. Then Goddess Durga was created and weapons were given
by them. Let Goddess Durga, whose battle attire is accompanied
by the loud cries of the devas, become a fort for me to stop
the terrible army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

निःश्वासप्रभवैश्च भूतनिवहैर्विध्वस्तदैत्योत्करा
हत्वा चिक्षुरमुत्क्षपय्य समरे सिंहेन तं चामरम् ।
आशूदग्रकरालबाष्कलबिडालादीनरीन् क्षिण्वती
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ ३॥

The sighs heaved by the Goddess turned into battallions and
with them she killed the army of asuras. Then She killed
ChikShura, the general of the asura army. Her lion jumped on
Chamara, another able member of the asuras and killed him in a
battle. Within moments She also destroyed the enemies udagra,
karAla, bAShkala, biDAla and others. Let Goddess Durga become
a fort for me to stop the terrible army of kRitAnta, the god
of death.

प्राप्तं क्षोभितविश्वमाशु महिषं संनाशयन्ती ततः
सिंहीभूतमथो नराकृतिमिभाकारं लुलायाकृतिम् ।
आक्राम्याङ्घ्रितलेन निर्गतममुं भूयोऽसिना छिन्दती
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ ४॥

When Mahisha who shook the entire world approached the Devi,
She destroyed him. But, he then took the form of a lion, then
came in the form of man, elephant and back to his original form.
She then attacked him with her foot and cut him up with Her
sword. Let Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the
terrible army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

निःशेषामरशक्तिरूपिणि शिवे माये महाविक्रमे
श्रीवागादिविभूतिरूपिणि रणे विद्युत्कृपानुग्रहे ।
शूलाद्यैरपि पालयेति दिविजैर्नीतादिशन्ती वरं
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ ५॥

᳚You are the personification of the power of the entire host of
devas, auspicious one, mAya - the consort of the parabrahman,
brave one, in a battle You are the form of LakShmi, Sarasvati and
other manifestations, yet, immediately like a lightning, You grace
people due to compassion, protect us with trident and other
weapons᳚. Thus when the devas praised You, You gave them boons.
Let that Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible
army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

दृप्यच्छुम्भनिशुम्भविक्रमचिरक्लिष्टैः सुरेन्द्रैः स्तुता
पार्वत्या वपुषोऽवतीर्य ललिताकारा हिमाद्रेस्तटे ।
डोलाकेलिविमोहितत्रिभुवना सा चण्डमुण्डेक्षिता
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ ६॥

Praised by the devas who were suffering because of their defeat
at the hands of the arrogant shumbha and nishumbha, a gentle form
emerged out of pArvati at the slopes of Himalayas. Sportingly She
attracted all the three worlds and was seen by chaNDa and muNDa.
Let that Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible
army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

चण्डावेदितरूपजातमदनस्तम्भेन शुम्भेन च
द्राग् दूते प्रहिते नियुद्धविजयी भर्ता ममेत्यूचिषी ।
युद्धेच्छुं किल धूम्रलोचनमथो सैन्यान्वितं धून्वती
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ ७॥

Being informed by chaNDa of the Devi's beautiful form, shumbha
became desirous of attaining her and immediately sent a messenger.
She sent him back with the message that only the one who defeats
her in a battle can become her husband. Enraged by her answer,
shumbha sent dhUmralochana, who wanted to fight. Devi destroyed
dhUmralochana along with his army. Let that Goddess Durga become
a fort for me to stop the terrible army of kRitAnta, the god of
death.

चण्डे मुण्डयते समेयुषि बलैः कालीमलीकान्तरात्
सृष्ट्वा भक्षितसैन्यशस्त्रकुलया तौ घातयन्ती तया ।
प्राप्ते शुम्भबले च केसरितुनः काली रवोद्धोषिनी
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ ८॥

When chaNDa and muNDa came with their forces, She created kAli
from her forehead. kAli then destroyed the army and its weapons
and then killed chaNDa and muNDa. Later when Shumba's army
approached, kAli expressed her anger by roaring aloud. Let that
Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible army of
kRitAnta, the god of death.

ब्रह्माण्डादिषु संगतासु शिवदूतीं च स्वशक्तिं तदा
सृष्ट्वा तत्प्रहितेन्दुमौलिवचसा दैत्यैः प्रवृत्ते रणे ।
क्रुध्यन्मातृअणार्दितं रिपुबलं दृष्ट्वा प्रहृष्टाशया
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ ९॥

Then shivadUtI (one who sent Siva as messenger) - her own power
was created from combining the powers of all the devas of the
brahmANDa. Then She was called to battle by the asuras who were
incited by the words of shiva (lord with the moon on his head)
who was sent by Her. She became delighted on seeing the army
being attacked by the angry mothers - the manifestations of
the devas' powers. Let that Goddess Durga become a fort for me
to stop the terrible army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

प्राप्तं संयति रक्तबीजमसुरं मातृप्रहारोद्गल-
द्रक्तोद्भूतभटौघपूर्णभुवनं भीतिप्रदं पश्यताम् ।
काल्या तत्क्षणपीतनष्टरुधिरं शस्त्रोत्करौर्निघ्नती
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ १०॥

The devas next saw the asura raktabIja, who came to the
battlefield and who created fear by filling earth with warriors
(of his kind) who sprung from his blood that oozed out of him
when he was struck by the shaktis. Then as and when Devi attacked
raktabIja, kAli drank his blood and ultimately he perished. Let
that Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible
army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

घोरे शुम्भनिशुम्भयोरथ रणारम्भे निशुम्भासुरं
खड्गाद्यैः कृतयुद्धमात्तपरशुं सम्मोह्य बाणोत्करैः ।
शुम्भं शक्तिशरौघभीषणरणं शूलार्दितं तन्वती
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ ११॥

Next was the terrible battle with shumbha and nishumbha. nishumba
who fought with an axe and arrows was struck unconscious by Devi
with a sword. Then with the trident She struck shumbha who was
fighting ferociously with 'shakti' - indra's weapon and with
arrows. Let that Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the
terrible army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

भूयः प्राप्तनिशुम्भमुक्तमभितश्चक्रायुधं छिन्दती
खड्गच्छिन्नगदं सशूलमथ तं शूलेन भित्त्वोरसि ।
वक्षोनिर्गतमन्यदस्य च वपुः खड्गेन निष्कृन्तती
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ १२॥

Again, nishumbha sent forth many chakras at the Devi which She
broke. She broke his gada with Her sword and then tore his chest
with Her trident. Another form of his came from his chest and
was immediately killed by Devi with her sword. Let that Goddess
Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible army of kRitAnta,
the god of death.

पञ्चास्येन च मातृभिश्च मथिते सैन्ये समभ्येयुषः
शुम्भस्यान्यबलावलम्बवचसा देवीर्विलाय्य स्वयम् ।
शस्त्रास्त्रोत्करभीषणं चिरतरं तेनाहवं तन्वती
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ १३॥

When the different shaktis and Her lion were fighting the asuras,
shumbha accused the devi of depending on another's strenth. So
She merged all other manifestations into Herself and fought for a
long with shumba who fought with many kinds of weapons (shastra)
and astras (arrows released after invoking a mantra). Let that
Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible army of
kRitAnta, the god of death.

छिन्नास्त्रेण तलप्रहारमथितेनानेन धृत्वा रुषा
व्योमान्तं गमिता नियुद्धमधिकं कृत्वाथ निष्पात्य तम् ।
शूलेन प्रविदार्य सर्वभुवनं निर्व्याकुलं कुर्वती
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ १४॥

shumba's weapons were destroyed and he was hit by Devi with her
palm. An angry shumbha took Her to the sky and fought fiercely.
Devi then decided that She had fought enough and killed him with
Her trident and made the earth free of distress. Let that Goddess
Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible army of kRitAnta,
the god of death.

आपन्नार्तिहरे प्रसीद शुभदे विश्वोसि नारायणि
ब्रह्माण्यादितनो प्रपालय भयाच्छूलादिघण्टादिभिः ।
रोगादीञ्जहि सर्वदायिनि वरं देहीति दैवैः स्तुता
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ १५॥

Remover of the miseries of those who are distressed, Bestower
of auspicious things, be pleased. nArAyaNi, You are the entire
world. brahmANi, the first being, protect us from fear with Your
weapons like trident and others and kill all diseases. O Giver
of everything, give us boons.᳚ Thus She was praised by the
devas. Let that Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the
terrible army of kRitAnta, the god of death.

भूयश्चापि तदा तदा रिपुबलं हन्तास्म्यहं चिन्तिता
मन्माहात्म्यकथापरानपि सदा सर्वत्र रक्षाम्यहम् ।
तेषां चाभिमतं ददाम्यखिलमित्युक्त्वा ततोऽन्तर्हिता
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ १६॥

Whenever I am remembered, I will again kill the host of asuras.
Always and everywhere I will protect those who are involved in
the stories describing My greatness. And I will give everything
that they wish for.᳚ So saying She disappeared. Let that Goddess
Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible army of kRitAnta,
the god of death.

माहात्म्यं च सुमेधसानुकथितं श्रुत्वा महीभृद्विशोः
सह्याद्रौ विहितत्रिवर्षतपसोः प्रत्यक्षतामेयुषी ।
भूभर्त्रे ददती पुनर्मनुपदं वैश्याय बोधप्रदा
रोद्धुं घोरकृतान्तसैन्यमिह मे दुर्गैव दुर्गायताम् ॥ १७॥

Hearing the greatness of Devi as related by the RiShi sumedhas,
king suratha performed tapas on the mountain sahyAdri for three years and
got a vision of the Goddess. She gave his kingdom back to suratha
and and the boon that he will be born to Lord sUrya and his wife
savarNA and will be known as sAvarNi and become the next manu.
She also gave the boon of self-realisation to the vaishya. Let
that Goddess Durga become a fort for me to stop the terrible army
of kRitAnta, the god of death.

श्रीदुर्गास्तुतिपद्यसप्तदशकं नित्यं पठन् मानवो
मुक्त्वा मृत्युभयं विहाय विपदं लब्ध्वाखिलं काङ्क्षितम् ।
मुक्तिं चापि लभते मुक्तिनिलये देव्याः कृपागौरवा-
न्निःशेषं फलमश्नुवीत गिरिजामाहात्म्यपाठोद्भवम् ॥ १८॥

By reading the seventeen verses of ᳚shrIdurgAsrutI᳚ daily, man is
freed from fear of death, leaves behind difficulties, gets all
that he wishes for and attains liberty. And in that state of
liberation, due to the grace of the Goddess, he enjoys in its
entirety the fruit that arises out of reading the greatness of
Goddess girijA.

इति दुर्गास्तुतिः समाप्ता 

With this, the hymn durgAstutiH concludes.
