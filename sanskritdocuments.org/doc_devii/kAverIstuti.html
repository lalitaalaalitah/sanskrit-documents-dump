These verses are in praise of river Kaveri - a sacred river flowing in
the southern peninsula of India. The river is one of the five great rivers
flowing in South India. The other four are Mahanadi, Godavari, Narmada and
Krishna. It is also the smallest of them all, being only 765 Km long. The
river is known for the scenic beauty of the regions it flows through. The
entire region it passes through is considered sacred. It has its birth
at Talakaveri at a height of 1320 feet in the Brahmagiri mountain in the
Western Ghats in Karnataka State.  There is a small temple there where
people offer worship to Kaveri. After flowing through Karnataka State
the river meanders through Tamil Nadu State and empties into the Bay of
Bengal on the eastern side of the peninsula.  It starts as a thin strand
of water and as it enters the plains at Bhagamandalam a small river
Gajoti joins it.  Bhagamandalam is a picturesque small village at the
foothills of thickly forested mountains with the two rivers flowing through
it. It has a small temple for Shiva who has the name Bhagamandaleshvara.
Later on rivers Hemavati and LakShmana Teertham join Kaveri and it becomes
large and deep. Here the waters of the thre rivers are collected at the
Krishnaraja Sagar dam. Other tributeries that join Kaveri are Shimsha,
Hemavati, Arkavati, Kabini and Bhavani. Near Tiruchy, in Tamil Nadu, the
river branches and joins again after a couple of kilometers further forming
the island of Srirangam. Nearby we have the Grand Anicut (Dam). It is 323
mts. long and 20 mts. high and built of stones. It was built during the
2nd century AD and stands as a tribute to the expertise of the builders
of those days.

The river flows through some of the richest lands of the country and blesses
the people on its course.  In return the people worship it. People of Tamil
Nadu worship thef floods with a festival called 18th day of Adi month
(July-August). They offer puja, light lamps and offer sweetmeats and,
fruits and flowers.

One may have a question as to whether it is rational to worship an inanimate
object like a river. The answer follows. Our scriptures say that it is the
one God who permiates everything. The Narayana Suktam says this clearly. It
says that whatever is there that is seen or heard of in the universe is
pervaded in and out by the Lord.  
     यच्च किञ्चिज्जगत्सर्वं दृश्यते श्रूयतेऽपि वा ।
     अन्तर्बहिश्च तत्सर्वं व्याप्य नारायणः स्थितः ॥
Lord Krishna echos this in Gita (9-4).मया ततमिदं सर्वं
जगदव्यक्त मूर्तिना ।  He says that the universe is pervaded by Him -
the unseen One.  So, what we see as the world is The Lord only. The very
first name in the Vishnu-sahasranama isविश्वम्  = the universe. But
we see the world as made of myriad objects and do not see the God.
Why so? Krishna gives the reason too in Gita.(7-13).
     त्रिभिर्गुणमयैर्भावैरेभिः सर्वमिदं जगत् ।
     मोहितं नाभिजानाति मामेभ्यः परमव्ययम् ॥
The world is deluded by His power of maya and so, does not see Him who is
beyond them. An example will provide the answer. We see an ornament  -
say  - a chain made of gold. We see the chain and talk about the chain
only and not the gold which really is the substance. The `chain' is not
a substance at all. There is no chain apart from gold. When we wear the
chain or handle it or lock it up in the cupboard we, in fact we are doing
all these with gold only in the garb of a chain. The `chain' is only a name
for a particular form of gold. In fact there is no such `thing' as chain! The
`chain' has its birth from gold, has its existance in gold and goes back into
gold when it is melted. Gold is the substratum or(अधिष्ठानम्). So also
is God the substratum of everything. He is known as theअधिष्ठानम् -
     अधितिष्ठन्ति भूतानि उपादानकारणत्वेन ब्रह्मेति अधिष्ठानम् ।
     ``मत्स्थानि सर्वभूतनि” (गीता ९।४) इति भगवद्वचनात् ।
(Vishnusahasranamam - 324) A verse in Shri Bhagavatam (VIII-3-3) makes this
abundantly clear. This was said by Gajendra the elephant in praise of the
Lord who rescued him from the grip of the crocodile. He said `I take refuge
in the self-existent Being in whom the universe rests, from whom it has
sprung, by whom it it has been brought into being, who Himself constitutes
it, and who is at the same time distinct from both the cause and effect.' 
     यस्मिन्निदं यतश्चेदं येनेदं य इदं स्वयम् ।
     योऽस्मात् परस्माच्च परस्तं प्रपद्ये स्वयम्भुवम् ॥
Taking the example of the chain, we find that it has its birth from the gold,
its existence in gold and finally goes back into gold when melted. So is
the case with everything in the universe.  The lay person sees movie and
misses the screen on which it is projected though he is looking at it all
the time! To extend the logic further he sees the world and misses the Lord
behind. The `world' we see is constituted of very many objects, animate
and inanimate. But though they appear to be different and bear different
names they are all the forms and names of the one Supreme Being only. So
the Lord has the nameविश्वम्  as said above. That is the reason we
have the custom of worshipping all objects. Because the worship of any
object or being is equivalent to the worship of the Lord. All animals
including the cow, the monkey and even the snake are objects of worship.
Even the `inanimate' objects such as the books, trees, mountains and rivers
are holy. There can be no such thing as a bad or evil thing.

The seers of ancient times had this grand vision. They could see through
the seuperficial layer and perceive God in everything. Krishna says
that a realised person will see only God in anything: for example
a learned righteous brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog which is
considered unclean, and also a mean outcast who eats the flesh of the
dog. Gita(5-18). 
     विद्या-विनय-संपन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।
     शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः ॥
The wordसमं  in this context means the Supreme Being and not `equal.'
This is made clear by Krishna in the very next verse (5-19).निर्दोषं
हि समं ब्रह्म ।   The famous vedic hymn Shri Rudram salutes the Supreme
Being by addressing Him by names of various objects, both good and `not
good' according to common man's perception. There are salutations to trees,
mountains, birds, dogs etc. There are even salutations to thieves,and cheats
who are nothing but forms of God only, because there cannot be anything but
God. He is the rivers also. Rudram salutes Him asनमो नाद्याय. This
nameनाद्यः  is in the Sivasahasranamam (No.684. Padmapuranam). The
commentator sayनदीगत जलरूपो नाद्यः। नमो नाद्याय चेति श्रुतिः ॥
For this reason we consider the rivers as sacred. They are not to be
polluted.  Do not urinate or spit in the waters advises the vedas.नाप्सु
मूत्रपुरीषं कुर्यात्। न निष्ठीवेत् ।  Our pilgrimages include visiting
famous temples and also taking bath in sacred rivers like Ganaga, Kaveri,
Yamuna etc..  We have hymns in praise of these rivers. Here we have a
short hymn in praise of the sacred river Kaveri.

The river is mentioned in the vedas and puranas. The Aghamarshana
Suktam(अघमर्षणसूक्तम्) which forms part of Mahanarayanavalli
in the Taittariyopanishad is a prayer addressed to Lord Varuna - the
god of waters. This is normally chanted before taking bath.अगं  =
sin.मर्षणम्  = cleaning or wiping off. So, this is a prayer to Varuna
to make us free from sins. In this sukta we come across the following prayer
addressed to some famous rivers.  
     इमं मे गङ्गे यमुने सरस्वति शुतुद्रि स्तोमग्ं सचता परुष्णिया ।
     असिक्निया मरुद्धृधे वितस्तया ऽऽजीकीये श‍ृणुह्या सुषोमया ॥
The rivers mentioned in this mantra are, Ganga, Yamuna, Sarasvati,
Shutudri (Sutlej), Parushni (Rabi), Asikni (Seenab), Vitasta (Jilam),
Sushoma (Sohan). The last four rivers mentioned here were flowing in the
Sind Province. In this mantra the word(मरुद्धृते) Maruddhrute
is a reference to Kaveri. In fact the hymn given in the beginning of this
article starts addressing Kaveri by this name only.  The Bhagavata Purana
mentions the river more than once. It says that during his pilgrimage
Lord Balarama visited Kanchi and the sacred river Kaveri.कामकोटिपुरीं
काञ्चीं कावेरीं च सरिद्वराम् ।  (10-79-14).  Again later on in Book
11 the sage Karabhajana, in his conversation with King Nimi talks of the
merits of Kaliyuga and says that it is in this age that great devotees of
the Lord will appear everywhere, especially in the Dravda country where
the rivers Tamaraparni, Kritamala, Payasvini, the extremely sacred Kaveri
and the great river Mahanadi which flows towards the west they will be
found in large numbers. (11-5-39).  
     क्वचित् क्वचिन्महाराज द्रविडेषु च भूरिशः ।
     ताम्रपर्णी नदी यत्र कृतमाला पयस्विनी ।
     कावेरी च महापुण्या प्रतीची च महानदी ॥

     (भविष्यन्ति नारायणपरायणाः ।)
Valmiki talks about it in his Ramayana. Sugriva sends various groups of
soldiers to search for Sita. He sends a group headed by Angada to search
in the southern direction. He gives details of places he will have to
search. At that time he describes the southern mountain range and the holy
river Kaveri as follows. He says that Angada will see the blessed heavenly
river Kaveri carrying pellucid waters and celestial nymphs sporting in the
river.  
     ततस्तामापगां दिव्यां प्रसन्नसलिलां शिवाम् ।
     तत्र द्रक्ष्यथ कावेरीं विहृतां अप्सरोगणैः ॥
                    (Kishkindha Kanda -41-14).
Kaveri is also known as DakShin Ganga - Ganga of the South and the river's
water is reputed to be limpid and sweet 
     अहं दक्षिणगङ्गेति विश्रुता वेदमूर्धनि ।
     इमां मधुरपानीयां दक्षिणापथजाह्नवीम् ॥
The Agnaeya Purana says that those who are contacted by the breeze blowing
from Kaveri get release from rebirth and reach the lotus feet of the Lord.  
     कावेरि त्रिजन्मानः कावेरि सलिलाप्लुता ।
     कावेरि वाताद्यै स्पृष्ठा यान्ति हरेःपदम् ॥
The Brahmavaivarta Puranam defines the word Kaveri as follows.  
     ककारः कलुषं हन्ति, वेकारो वाञ्छितप्रदः ।
     रीकारो मोक्षदो नृणां कावेरीत्यवधारय ॥
The letter ka stands for the destruction of sins, ve for the bestowal of
desires and ri for the granting of mokSha or liberation from the cyclic
births.  Kaveri is also known as Kanakasarit(कनकसरित्). Kanakam
(कनकम्) means gold and sarit(सरित्) means river. The sand in the
bed of Kaveri is said to be rich in gold content.  Kaveri is called Ponni
(pon = gold) in Tamil.  The great acharya Shri Vedanta Desika mentions
the glory of the river in his famous work Sri Bhagavaddhyana sopanam
(verse no.2).  
     वेलातीत श्रुतिपरिमलं वेधसांमौलि सेव्यं
          प्रादुर्भूतं कनकसरितस्सैकते हंसजुष्टे ।
     लक्ष्मीभूम्योः करसरसिजैर्लालितं रङ्गभर्तुः
          पादांभोज प्रतिपलतु मे भावनादीर्घिकायाम् ॥
The acharya says that the lotus feet of the Lord Ranganatha appeared on the
golden sands of Kaveri which are home to hamsas or swans. It is said that
swans do not like to stay in turbid waters.न बद्ध्नाति रतिं हंसः
कदाचित्कर्दमेऽम्भसि ।  The water of Kaveri is clean and have gold
content in the sands. So, the birds prefer to stay in such lovely place.
The wordहंसः  also mean sanyasins of the highest order - paramahamsa
sanyasis. This means that the great sanyasis gather on the shores of Kaveri
because of its sacredness.

STORY OF THE RIVER KAVERI
There was a king by name Kavera. He was righteous and ruled his kingdom
according to the injunctions of the scriptures.  He sought liberation or
mokSha and with this in mind he did severe penance.  Brahma the creator
was pleased with his penanace and appeared before the king and wanted to
know his wish. The king requested Brahma to grant him mokSha.  Brahma said
that this is not something which He can grant but can be attained only
by one getting spiritual wisdom or jnanam.  He requested Maya Devi to
appear before them. Brahma asked Maya to be born as the king's daughter
and impart him the required knowledge. In addition Brahma told her to
become a river by name Kaveri and save all beings and also she, by another
aspect to become the wife of sage Agastya and spread spiritual wisdom.
Accordingly Maya appeared before the king Kavera as an infant. The king
was very happy at this. He took the child with him and brought it up with
loving care. After some years, the king renounced the kingdom, repaired
to the forests, performed severe penanace and attained liberation. Kaveri
wanted to serve the world in the form of a river and to achieve this
she prayed to Lord Narayana and did penance. Pleased with her devotion,
the Lord appeared before her and learned of her desire. He told her that
He will reside in a gooseberry tree in the Sahyadri hills. Brahma will
worship Him in the tree and wash His feet with the water from the river
Vraja in his conch. She should merge herself with those waters and flow in
the southern regions and sanctify that area. She will get the names Sahya
amalaka Tirtha, Shanka Tirtha and DakShina Ganga.  In this period sage
Agasthya was performing penanace. Brahma appeared before him and advised
him to get married and lead the life of a householder. At first he sage
was not agreeable to this idea.  Brahma explained to him the greatness of
a householders' life and suggested that he marry His daughter Kaveri. This
will be of advantage to him and also to everyone. Agasthya was convinced
of Brahma's words and agreed to marry Kaveri. He went to the Himalayas
and met Kaveri who was performing penance there. He told her of Brahma's
advice to him. Kaveri agreed to marry the sage.  She divided herself
into two forms. With the name Kaveri she entered the(कमण्डलु)
waterpot of the sage. With another body and the name(लोपामुद्रा)
Lopamudra she bowed to the sage. The gods assembled at that place. Brahma
got Lopamudra married to Agasthya as per the vedic rules. The sage
with his wife saluted to the gods assembled there.  Sarasvathi Devi,
her mother, advised her in detail the duties of a householder's wife.
After the marriage Agasthya with his wife started his journey to the
south, crossed the Vindhya mountains and reached the Sahya mountains. He
kept his water pot in a place and told his desciples that he is going
to the nearby Swarnamukhi river to perform his ablutions and till his
return to look after it.  At that time Brahma saw Lord Vishnu shining in
a gooseberry tree nearby. He was overjoyed. He circumambulated the tree
and washed the feet of the Lord with the water that had the essence of
all the holy waters from the conch (that represented the Gaytri mantra)
he had. The holy water grew into a stream and flowed down the mountain.

Kaveri who was staying in sage Agasthya's water pot saw this and was
filled with joy.  At that time a heavenly voice addressed Kaveri and
said that the time for fulfilment of her wish is very near. ``The time
for you to reach the ocean has come. The holy autumn(शरद्) season
has come. In this season even a small gift given to a deserving person
will yield immense benefit. As the result of your severe penance this
also happens to be birth of the month of Thula (7th month of the solar
calendar). You should proceed and mingle with the holy waters that is
flowing from the worship offered by Brahma. You will be conferring great
benefit to the people of the country''.  By divine will a strong wind
accompanied by heavy rain started blowing at that time. The disciples
of the sage forgot all about the sage's advice to take care of his water
pot and ran for cover. The strong wind upset the pot. Kavri flowed from
the pot, mixed with the waters in the stream and started to flow in the
southern direction.  Sage Agasthya returned after finishing his ablutions
and saw what had happened.  He was very happy to see Kaveri flowing down
the mountain as a river. He summoned Kaveri and blessed her. She told
the sage what all happened in his abscence and how she got mixed with
the holy waters from bathing the feet of Lord Vishnu who appeared in the
tree. Sage Agastya was pleased by the answer of Kaveri. He lauded her
and said that the Southern Peninsula will derive great benefit from her.
Then he also passed on to her some secret information he knew by his
great spiritual power.  
     महारहस्यं किञ्चात्र श‍ृणुष्वात्यद्भुतं शुभे ।
     ब्रवीमि दिव्यदृष्ट्याद्य सर्वशास्त्रेषु निश्चितम् ॥

     महापातकिनां पापं मोचयन्त्यः क्षणेन हि।
     गङ्गादिका महानद्यस्तीर्थानि च महान्ति च ॥

     मलीकृताश्च तत्पापैः अशक्तास्तद्विमोचने ।
     शोचयन्त्यः परं देवं यान्ति लोकपितामहम् ॥

     तासां विशुद्धये ब्रह्मा सभायां मुनिभिः सह ।
     सम्यग्विचार्य शास्त्रेषु वेदेषु च पुनः पुनः ॥

     हरिणा च ततः प्रोक्तं प्रायश्चित्तं विधास्यता ।
     स्नास्यन्तु सह्यधात्र्यग्रे कावेर्यां तौलिसङ्गमे ॥
The rivers like Ganga that are renowned to cleanse people who take bath
in them of their sins were polluted by the sins washed into them. They
were sad at this and approached Brahma, the Creator, to find a way to
get themselves rid of this huge load of sins dumped into them. Brahma
discussed this issue with the sages assembled in his court at that time
and looked into the scriptures also for an answer.  They came across
the expiation mentioned by Shri Hari - that is they should take bath in
Kaveri in the seventh month(तुला) of solar calendar. The 66 crores
of waters from all the 14 worlds come to Kaveri at that period to wash
off their sins. They should also go to Kaveri and take bath at that time.  
षट्षष्टिकोटि तीर्थानि द्विसप्त-भुवनेषु च ।
तानि चायान्ति कावेर्यां स्वाघौघ-विनिवृत्तये ॥
Such a holy river naturally attracts holy men to its banks.  He said
that he as also many other sages will have residence on her banks. 
अहं तु वैखानस वालखिल्यैरन्यैः मुनीन्द्रैस्सनकादिभिश्च ।
सर्वत्र ते पुण्यतटे वसामि ॥

Sage Agastya told this to Kaveri and blessed her saying that she will
confer all prosperity for those living in the southern part of the
country.  
     विभूत्यै दाक्षिणत्यानां क्षेमाय विजयाय च ।
     मया चैवाभ्यनुज्ञाता गच्छ देवि यथासुखम् ॥

We are indeed blessed to have such sacred rivers in our country. Let
us pray to Kaveri and be cleansed of our sins. The following verse gives
a description of Kaveri devi and is suitable for meditation on Her.  
     अच्छ-स्वच्छ-लसद्-दुकूलवसनां पद्मासनाध्यायिनीं
          हस्त-न्यस्त-वराभयाब्ज-कलशां राकेन्दु-कोटि-प्रभाम् ।
     भास्वद्-भूषण-गन्ध-माल्य-रुचिरां चारु-प्रसन्नाननां
          श्रीगङ्गादि-समस्त-तीर्थ-निलयां ध्यायामि कावेरिकाम् ॥
The verse, roughly translated, says that I meditate on Kaveri who wears
spotlessly clean silk garments, and is seated in the Padmasana pose. She
has one palm of the hand pointing down indicating that She will grant
desires of those who seek her and another palm of the hand pointing up
indicating She will protect and grant freedom from fear. She wears shining
jewels and fine smelling garlands and has a pleasing smiling face. She is
the repository of all holy wates like Ganga.
