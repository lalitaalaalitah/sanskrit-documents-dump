<P>CHAPTER  II

                  <P>RECENT PROBLES FOR ELDERLY
<P>  We are aware that the elderly people are increasing day by day in America and other parts of the world. We know about the Joint Family system and individual style of family system. Here in this country there are two styles of east and Western philosophy. Most of the people coming from Asian countries have a joint family system when the parents are staying with their children The Indian people mostly have the joint family system and mostly they invite their parents with love, compassion and with great respect towards them. This is the best philosophy with which Indians are brought up. Parents enjoy a very respectable, honorable and respectable position in Indian way of life. Mostly we are with the best type of family life where we find deep love between the brothers and sisters, respect for the mother and father and stay happily in one house

<P>Recently we came across some critical problems amongst the brothers to keep the parents or not. In one elderly case the daughter refused to keep her parents. Our Director Srimati Santoshkumar of the Metropolitan Asian Family Services made temporary arrangements.

<P>Sometimes the parents are forced to go back to India. In that case the parents have already allotted their properties to their sons. in that case there is a problem as to where to stay and how to prolong the rest of life. These are serious problems in the families of Asian origin in general and Indian origin in particular.

<P>There are various stories about the death of one elderly woman who did suicide in the compound of the house because the other brother did not allow the mother to come in. These are the reverse side of development going in family.s breakup. Here are some of the thoughts to be considered by the elderly people who are passing through this type of life style in joint family.

<OL>
<LI>Elderly people ought to have deep love, compassion and sympathy to all the members 
     Of the family equally without any partiality to any one of them.

<LI>They should communicate to all family members daily or at several times inquiring
    About their health and birthdays and important days of life they ought enjoy in
    Celebration such important incidents in life.

<LI>No interference to any member of the family or discussing any personal matters of the
     family without any reference to them.

<LI>Try to help them by taking care of the grand children as the family love for them. Do
    Not utter anything about caring about them. This is the family love, family values and  
   Family unity with which the elderly came to this country with that type of mission in
    Life.

<LI>Whenever any opportunity arises, try to explain our religious faith, and family
   Celebrations and ritualistic belief with which we are brought up.

<LI>Try to tell stories of our ancient saints to small children and grand children so that they
    Can follow our religious traditions, beliefs and understanding of our cultural heritage.
     And our own languages.

<LI>Don't be angry with any one, remain tolerant and be sympathetic and polite to
   Everybody in the house. Note that love, compassion and deep gratitude.s are main
    aspects of human life.

<LI>Try to understand about the rights and privileges of senior citizens by approaching any
   of our three centers of Metropolitan Asian Family Services and try to be independent
   on one.s own foot Try to get all benefits of social security, Supplementary Social
   Security, food stamps and other welfare benefits available to all of us in there
   respective townships. Please look to the materials published by the city of Chicago or
   the township approach to them for help. Try to take advantage of the new  Prescription 
   Drug  benefits  available to elderly people in all states of America..

<LI>Try to go to the library and pass some of our time to know what is happening in this
    country. Be active in life. Depend upon yourself in all activities of life.


<LI>We have provided some places for the senior people, at our centers and so try to go
       there and meet other senior citizens and communicate with them. We have four 
       senior centers in Chicago metropolitan areas Get details on phone 773-465-3105
 Inquire about Adult Day care at Western Avenue and  Niles Senior center

<LI>Whenever there are any meetings or conferences organized by Metropolitan Asian
     family Services or by the township where you stay, try to attend such functions or
     lectures pertaining to our health or benefits.

<LI>Be ware of citizenship tests and try to be a citizen by passing all tests and get
      citizenship rights for future benefits.

<LI>Try to be a member of Social Security Committee by paying some ten dollars per
       year so that we can save our benefits by representing our claims through such
       organizations.

<LI>Who are able and are driving cars, they can volunteer some services to some
     organizations, temples or hospitals for helping needy people.

<LI>Every body should try to be independent in driving cars or knowing bus and railway
     facilities for going from place to place.

<LI>Keep the lists of friends for advice and consultations and remain in contact with them
     so that loneliness is broken and you feel well.

     house or on the cycle machine or any other machines so as to keep bather health.

       sugar for the prevention of the further spread of any diseases.

                 <P>HOW TO AVOID LONELINESS IN LIFE
<P>This article is particularly written for elderly people still however some suggestions are applicable to other people of younger age.

<P>Elderly people experiences loneliness when their sons and daughters go on work and they are alone. The children go to school. It is a question as to how to pass time.

<P>Loneliness is more about psychic disconnection than physical solicitude. To appreciate time alone most of us need to feel we have a choice that our friends or family members are nearer to us from our phone call distance The primary feeling of loneliness has something to do with a genetic instinct that equates safety with physical closeness to our family Sometimes loneliness is felt like near death condition.

<P>The emotion of loneliness is not just personal Loneliness is like anger and fear in life and it is one of the universal primal emotions groove in humanity.s sub consciousness.
Most of us can.t help but fall into it at one time or the other

<P>Mostly when I came to this country I was feeling the same thing but I started involving my self in taking part in social activities and have changed my walk of life. As my family members came and settled in the state of Illinois we felt family life to get her

. For meditation, one has to put in a concerted effort to completely detach oneself, on mental and emotional levels, from one's own feelings and thought processes, as well as from the physical world to prevent distractions. On the other hand, while laughing, we do not have any conscious thought process and all our senses naturally and effortlessly combine in a moment of harmony, to give joy, peace and relaxation.

<P>Gardening can make a difference in our life it creates a sense of peace, tranquility of mind and help us to relax

<LI>OBSERVING COMPLETE SILENCE

                                    <P>CHAPTER VI
                     <P>HOW TO LIVE LONGER LIFE

<P>It is mystery in life as to how to live longer in life. Here are some important factors to live longer I have written my experiences in this article.

<LI>LONGIVITY GENES

<P>Have longevity in their genes meaning that family members are more likely to die as well
<P>There are longevity genes from our forefathers. Dr Robert Arking of Wayne State University I Detroit USA recently completed study of two types of fruit files One significantly longer-lived than the other By meticulously deleting various chromosomes from the type that lived longer Arking was able to Zero in on the location of the genes responsible for longevity .genes that were not present in the shorter .lived fruit file (Reference in .Live longer Live Better By Reader.s Digest)

<P>This principle of gene is also applied to human beings. If our fathers and forefathers lived a longer life than we have every chance to live longer provided we maintain the same life style 

<LI>CHILDHOOD TRAINING

<P>If we have trained our body in gymnasia and have done severe exercises like sitting and standing exercises in special Akhada then we have more opportunity to live longer. This is my experience I was trained in my small Village .Umreth . in Gujarat and has continued my exercises upto twenty years of my life and it helped me to live longer upto eighty-eight years today.

<LI>EXPLOIRE YOUR FEELINGS

<P>We ought to keep good thinking and positive feelings about life to live. Old people should never think about their age. American people always say that I am young at this age. In short the key to successful aging is to ignore that we are growing old. The feelings that we have in our mind are the main positive thinking that works for our longevity.
<P>When we have good family to take one.s care and when elderly people are respected in their families and amongst their friends then they like to prolong their life. otherwise they prefer to end their lives.

<LI>KEEP RIGHT POSITIVE ATTITUDES IN LIFE

<P>The people who are less tense by nature and higher in self-confidence as well having optimistic attitude and an easy going approach in life. We must have positive attitude attitude in life and it helps us to live longer. George Gless (aged 88) says he tries and makes the world a better place. In 2002 researchers at the Mayo clinic in Rochester MINN found the optimistic people decreased their risk of early death by 50% compared with those who leaned more towards pessimism.


<LI>MAINTAINING MARRIAGE LIFE

<P>Those who have a long marriage life live longer when both partners live together with love and compassion it is natural that they plan to live longer. Only thing is that they ought to have e a compassionate and caring life. As marriage evolves over the years keeping our relationship vital is well worth the effort it takes According to latest studies and research people in long-term relationship in marriage tend to be healthier and more emotionally and financially secure than other people of their age. Get a pet and get married for a longer life span

<LI>WALKING FOR HEALTH

<P>Walking is the best exercise for longevity in life Hundred and thousands of people have taken up walking for exercise in recent years making it one of the country.s most popular exercise. There are various types of walking. Some people walk around their houses, some walk in the clubs, some walk on the treadmill, some walk in the house in the basement.

<LI>LIGHT EXERCISES

<P>Older people ought to perform some light exercises of hand, feet, and moving various parts of the body While exercising, we are required to use our breathing breaths while uttering . Soham Mantra . or mantra of one.s faith. Such exercises should be done in quiet serene and quiet atmosphere in one corner of the house where there is no disturbance. I am doing such exercises for twenty minutes in the morning and evening and as a result of which I am keeping my stamina, strength and vitality to work during the day. This is great!
.
<P>Clarence Custer (aged 90) says .I exercise every singly day. I am eighty-two years old and I am doing light 3exercises two times during the day it takes thirty minutes in the morning and the same time in the afternoon. As for exercise 30 minutes of moderate sustained activity five times a week increases life expectancy.

<P>Mr. Clarence Custer takes part in playing tennis This is also a part of exercise program and it also helps elderly to live longer

<LI>HEALTHY EATING

<P>In the study of 2700 residents in Tecumsch Michigan men who volunteered for community organizations were two and half times less likely to die from all causes of disease than their noninvolved peers

<LI>STAYING A HEALTHY LIFE STYLE

<P>The secrets of healthy life style are neither mysterious nor difficult It all depends upon the following habits or manner of living: -

<LI>Eat a well balanced varies diet everyday.

<LI>Exercise regularly Exercise can stave off those moments. Researchers at the University of Kentucky have found that aerobic exercises increases senior.s abilities to recall names and perform other mental tasks And at the University of Maryland they have learned that fit adults are better at solving math problems than those who do not exercise And of course exercise can help lower your risk of hearts attacks and stoke.

<LI>Do not smoke This is very effective

<LI>Drink alcohol in moderation if at all. In my opinion it is preferable not to drink any type
   of alcohol.Drink something red The British Medical Journal reports that red wine is
    highest in antioxidants but acknowledges that the same value can be achieved by
   drinking red grape juice.

<LI>Keep enough sleep and rest Sleep more and laugh more. People with chronic sleep
   problems have a higher mortality rate whereas those who get a good night.s rest suffer 
   fewer illnesses People who cultiv7ate laughter heal faster and feel better The
   researchers from Pennsylvania State University found that missing sleep can affect
    hormones levels and generate harmful chemicals in the body On the contrary it kiss
    recommended that do not oversleep

<LI>Be sure to have regular checkups Al, types of checkups should be done as
   recommended by various doctors. When such checkups are done any new diseases
  effect can be  taken care of. This is effectual for longer life to live. Be particular to take
  medicines in time without fail

<LI>Be passionate in work Be active throughout the day
.
<LI>MAINTAIN HEALTHY STATE OF MIJND

<P>Still have normal thinking abilities and do not suffer from degradation brought by Ills ness such as Alzheimer.s disease According to various studies it is noticed that people who enjoy close personal relationships have many interests and stay on control of their lives tend to be healthier and to live longer.

<P>Here are important habits to form for a longer life than expected:-

<P>Nurture your ties with family and friends Elderly people should try to remain closed to their sons, daughters and grandchildren  and remain in their contact everyday inquiring about their work and conveying good ideas to all of them
.Keep phone numbers ready to talk with your friends and talk to them about any problem pertaining to their health or any subject of interests. This is what I am doing. Besides I am engaged in social work pertaining to senior citizens activity pertaining to various activities of their health and benefits available to them Most of my time goes in such services This keeps me happy and  contented in my life This is great !

<P>Become more active in day-to-day activities

<P>Preserve your independence

..Reduce stress The person who can control stress in life we should not be 
 emotional over all issues of life..We ought to rely upon almighty God Our Faith in Him will give us strength and courage to handle problems of life.

<LI>KEEP LAUGHING  EVERYDAY.

<P>Generally we should have a humorous attitude in all dealings of life. In all scriptures there is a mention that all human beings must be jolly,happay and have a laughing style of life. That is why so many laughing clubs have been started just to stay happy, healthy and having long life.

<LI>REMAIN CLOSER TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS

<P>Elderly people should  remain closed to all sons, daughters and grandchildren everyday inquiring about their work and conveying good ideas to all of them. Keep phone numbers ready to talk with your friends and talk to them abut any problem in life. This is called Satsang. which promotes good support and feelings amongst all.

<P>This what I am doing. I have many friends in all states of USA and I spend some time talking with them about ay-good activity that we are doing. we exchange good ideas amongst our friends through email In such activity elderly people feel great and thus time is passed during the day.
