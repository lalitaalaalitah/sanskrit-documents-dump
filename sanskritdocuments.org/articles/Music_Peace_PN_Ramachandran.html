<H2><EM>Sri Kanchi Mahaswami</EM>  &#39s Discourses </H2>
<H3>(English translation by P.N. Ramachandran) </H3>
<P><FONT face=Arial>(The <EM>Mahaswami 
</EM>(late) <EM>Sri Chandrasekharendra Sarasvati Swami</EM>    
   is considered a saint of recent times. His 
discourses on various topics while on a visit to Madras in 1930&#39s are indeed the 
benchmark.) </FONT>          
              
       </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><EM>Sri Appar 
Swami</EM> (Devotee &amp; Tamil Poet) has listed various items, which generate 
pleasure and peace to the mind. Though these appear as pleasures arising out of 
the sensory organs, <EM>Sri Appar</EM>      
             
             
has included them in his list as those giving permanent and divine pleasure. 
What are these items?</FONT>            
            
               
         </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Firstly, pure and blemish-less sound of the <EM>Veena</EM>, <BR>
Milky white light of the full moon,<BR> 
Gentle breeze from the south,<BR>
Regeneration of life during the early spring, and<BR> 
A tank or pond wherein the lotus flowers are constantly 
buzzed by the bees. </FONT> 
              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Thus, while citing 
sensory pleasures as examples of pleasure derived from intense devotion to God, 
<EM>Sri Appar</EM>      
           gives the 
first place to music.</FONT>           
           
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Good music &#45 particularly that played on the instrument most suited to Indian 
music, namely, <EM>Veena</EM> &#45 would always have a divine connotation. 
Our ancestors devoted all their music as a form of worship of God. That music 
created an intense awareness of God both in the performers as well as in the 
audience. <EM>Sri Yaagnavalkya</EM>, the author of <EM>Dharma Saastra</EM>, has stated thus: It is enough to 
perform music in a blemish-less manner; there is no need for meditation, 
<EM>yoga</EM>  
               
   , <EM>tapas</EM> (intense penance), <EM>pooja</EM> 
(worship with flowers etc.), or difficult sacrifices. The music itself would 
lead the way to <EM>Moksha</EM> (liberation).</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Another special feature is that not 
only the artist but also all in his audience derive the same pleasure from his 
performance as the artist himself does.</FONT>              
            
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Goddess 
<EM>Saraswati</EM> (the goddess of the arts, learning etc.) always plays on the 
<EM>Veena</EM>            
  and sings about the various playful acts of <EM>Parameswara</EM>, so 
says <EM>Soundarya Lahari</EM>.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><EM>Sri Sankara 
Bhagavatpada</EM>   sets out in <EM>Soundarya Lahari </EM>the 
Goddess&#39 graceful neck thus. He describes beautifully that the entire art of 
music is born from the Goddess. Three lines, seen on the throat, are auspicious 
signs of ideal beauty or signs associated with the great. <EM>Sri Acharya</EM>  
             
              
          refers in this 
context to the three of the seven basic notes in music (<EM>swaraas</EM>), 
namely <EM>Shadja</EM>, <EM>Madhyama</EM> and <EM>Gaandhaara</EM>. All the 
different <EM>Raagaas</EM> (combination of notes or musical scales), with 
ornamentation (<EM>gamaka</EM>        
 ) have their roots in these basic notes or 
scales.</FONT>        
          </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>O! Goddess! You are 
expert in the nuances (tempo and ornamentation) of music. The three basic notes 
were themselves born out of your neck. To indicate, as it were, the limits of 
places of generation or ending of the three <EM>swaraas</EM>             
               
             
appropriate to the three basic notes, the three lines have appeared on your 
neck! (Another interpretation is that <EM>Shadja</EM>, <EM>Madhyama</EM> and 
<EM>Gaandhaara</EM> 
are the three villages considered to be the source of the major Indian 
melodies.)</FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>The 
<EM>Bhagavatpada</EM> , who has enunciated the 
<EM>advaita</EM> (non-duality) doctrine, was equally adept in music. Music 
itself merges the individual souls with their root, namely, <EM>Paramatma</EM> (supreme God). 
<EM>Kalidasa</EM> 
   (the great Sanskrit poet) has sung as 
&#34<EM>sarigamapadaniratham</EM>&#34 in his &#34<EM>Navarathna Maalika</EM>&#34 describing 
the Goddess in her appearance as <EM>Syaamala</EM> carrying the <EM>Veena</EM>. 
The poet says that her soft heart and the eternal peace residing therein, which 
is synonymous with <EM>advaita</EM>, become clear from her music. Music may cause 
many pleasant feelings, but peace alone must be the ultimate end of music. 
Moreover music causes soft feeling hearts. <EM>Muthuswamy Dikshitar</EM>        
              
        (a great 
devotee) entered into <EM>samaadhi</EM> (tomb) playing 
on the <EM>Veena</EM>      the good 
qualities of <EM>Meenakshi</EM> alias <EM>Syaamala</EM> 
who is herself highly skilled in musical ornamentation. <EM>Thyagaraaja</EM>     
     (music composer and devotee) has 
in one of his songs, set in the <EM>Syaama Raaga</EM>, (on hearing which even those without 
knowledge of the language, get limitless peace of mind), sung that there is no 
happiness or welfare without peace. <EM>Sri Appar</EM>     
             
          (Devotee &amp; Tamil 
Poet) too has referred in his poem to the intense devotion to God leading to 
great peace. </FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial>DIVINE EXPERIENCE 
THROUGH MUSIC: <EM>Saraswati</EM>, the Goddess of Arts &amp; learning, is always 
having the <EM>Veena</EM> in her hands. <EM>Kalidaasa</EM>       
            , the 
great Sanskrit poet, has composed &#34<EM>Navarathna Maalika</EM>&#34. In that 
poem, he has stated that <EM>Paraasakthi</EM>, <EM>Sri Parameswara</EM>&#39s 
consort, also has the<EM> Veena</EM> in her hands. He states that the Goddess is 
playing on the <EM>Veena</EM>&#39s strings by the tips of her fingers; and that she 
is enjoying the ornamentation and combination of the seven <EM>swaraas</EM>        
            
               
             
. </FONT>

<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG><EM>Sarigamapadanirathaam thaam<BR>
 Veenasankraantha kaanthahasthaam thaam</EM></STRONG> 
</FONT>
    
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><EM>Sivakaantha</EM> (Siva&#39s consort) is thus immersed in music; She is 
<EM>Saantha</EM> (full of peace), <EM>Mridula swaantha</EM> (having a heart full of mercy). I bow 
to Her&#45 thus says <EM>Kalidaasa</EM>         
    .</FONT>     
        </P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG><EM>Saanthaam Mridulaswaanthaam<BR>
 Kucha Barathaanthaam namaami Sivakaanthaam</EM></STRONG> </FONT>
     
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>From the tenor of 
the <EM>sloka</EM>     , it appears 
that the Goddess has become the embodiment of peace due to her complete 
absorption in music. Likewise it seems as though, owing to her musical 
experience, her heart has become soft like the petals of a flower and full of 
mercy. </FONT>           
             
             
       
     
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When 
<EM>Paarvathi</EM> (<EM>Sri Parameswara</EM>&#39s consort) is looked upon as the 
Goddess of Music, she takes the name of <EM>Syaamala</EM>. <EM>Syaamala</EM>       
             is 
immersed in music and is full of <EM>ananda</EM> (happiness) and <EM>saanta</EM> 
(peace). She has a child-like heart. She will pour out her mercy on her 
devotees. The quality of mercy is forever pouring out of her. In the divine 
presence, brim-full of music, peace and happiness will arise spontaneously. If 
we surrender ourselves unto <EM>Siva Kaanta</EM> (<EM>Siva</EM> &#39s consort), we shall attain this 
peace and happiness. </FONT>     

     
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>From these, it is clear that music will 
lead to happiness, peace, a soft heart and merciful nature. </FONT>          
   
     
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>One can attain divine experience through relentless 
study of the <EM>Vedas</EM>, <EM>yoga</EM> , meditation and ritual worship 
(<EM>pooja</EM>). The same experience can be got easily without much hardship 
through music (that is also divine in nature) with good knowledge of the 
arrangement of notes and rhythm. This is the declaration of the great sage 
<EM>Yaagya Valkya Maharishi</EM>, who has composed the scripture <EM>Dharma 
Saastra</EM>. Referring to music played on the <EM>Veena</EM>, he has stated thus &#45 </FONT> 
     
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>&#39<EM>Aprayatnena</EM>&#39 &#45 even without severe effort &#45 
one can reach the path to <EM>Moksha</EM> (liberation). If we 
immerse our mind in divine music and become totally absorbed in it, we can 
easily experience God. The listeners to the music we enjoy singing orally or 
playing on instruments, will also get the same divine experience. Practice of no 
other art leads to the experience of pleasures both to the players as well as to 
the audience. Great devotees such as <EM>Thyagaraja</EM>    
              
             
             
                
       had surrendered their hearts and 
minds fully unto the Supreme God through the path called music. These great 
personalities are the constant witnesses to the fact that music itself is 
Godhead. </FONT>       
              
             
               
              
            
             
     
     
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><EM>Paarvati</EM> is the energy behind the Supreme God 
(<EM>Brahmam</EM>). Sound itself is the Supreme God. The Goddess has her 
happiness from her immersion in music. This fact denotes that the energy and the 
Supreme God are one and indivisible. This is the essence of <EM>advaita</EM> 
(non-duality). The Goddess pours out her natural grace and mercy: She blesses 
those who worship her through music, to merge their <EM>Atma</EM> (souls) with 
the <EM>Paramatma</EM> (Supreme Soul or God).</FONT></P>
