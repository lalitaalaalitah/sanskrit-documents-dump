<LI><B>(4) EVERY INDIAN SHOULD KNOW THIS MESSAGE OF LORD McCAULEY</B><BR>
Lord McCauley.s speech in British Parliament on 2nd February, 1835 
for converting India to a land suitable for them to rule and make 
Indians the British slaves : .I have traveled the length and breadth of 
India and there I have not seen one person who is a beggar, who is a 
thief. Such wealth I have seen in this country, such high moral values, 
people of such caliber, that I do not think we would ever conquer this 
country, unless we break the very backbone of this nation, which is her 
spiritual and cultural heritage and, therefore, I propose that we 
replace her old and ancient education system, her culture, for if the Indians 
think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater than 
their own, they will lose their self esteem, their native culture and they 
will become what we want them, a truly dominated nation.

<B>LET US BREAK THE CLUTCHES PUT ON US BY THE FOREIGN RULERS !</B><BR>
<P>Dhanyathman:- Until 1947 Aug. 15th the foreign rulers of this 
country destroyed our culture and heritage. After 1947 Aug 15th our own 
rulers are destroying our self- respect and glorious culture national 
values. Even after 60 years of independence, the 1080 million 
Indians are ignorant about India and Indian heritage. They are even 
ignorant that they are ignorant about India. We do not have any shame to 
belittle and denigrate our country and culture. We, even make fun of 
our values, heritage, culture and laugh on ourselves. We support 
others when they denigrate and make fun of ourselves. Some of our 
thinkers, intellectuals, rulers, politicians and scientists are continue to 
play the cruel role in these negative activities. Some of the 
politicians reap by dividing us, like the British rulers did. Both the 
foreign and Indian rulers were/are successful in the heinous 
activities. We always talk about values and value based education !Can we 
import them ? If yes, from where can we import these values ? Do you 
think that they are available for importing as capsules ? Look into 
the progress made by Japan ! A country which got resurrected from 
the ashes after two atom bomb explosions! How could they achieve this 
great position in the world .Each and every Japanese child took the 
pledge that he/she will build a modern Japan from the ashes using 
science and technology, without killing their great heritage, culture and 
values. The patriotism and nationalism were their roads for progress, 
value based life was their driving force, perfect unity was their 
vehicle, dedication and punctuality were their qualifications, glory of 
their motherland was their ultimate destination. The land of volcanoes 
achieved what they wanted to achieve. Now, the world is saluting Japan 
for their quality and efficiency. Can we not follow them ? Better 
late than never! We may be Christians, Muslims, Hindus, atheists, 
leftists, rightists or middlistists. If there is a will and sound 
patriotism nothing else is important. We are Indians that is important. Let 
us take the inspiration from India . We, THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF 
SCIENTIFIC HERITAGE, are undertaking a great mission of spreading the 
modern and ancient Indian message through INDIA SIXTY VISION AND MISSION 
to 100 million people within a period of two years from 2006 
Aug.15th to 2008 Aug. 15th in connection with the SHASHTYABDAPOORTI of Indian 
independence which falls on 2007 Aug.15th. Let us all together 
build a proud India by inculcating self respect and patriotism in our 
mind. As our President Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam put the mission, let 
us all focus our karma and dharma towards taking our maathru bhoomi, 
karma bhoomi, jnaana bhoomi, yajna bhoomi to vikasitha dharma bhoomi 
by 2020 or before that.

ultimate aim was dividing Indians for their benefits. 
<LI>Remember the Aryan Invasion, Arya -Dravida war, Aryan - Dravidian 
languages, Aadivasies - Dalits, the caste by birth system, theories are 
all put forth by British for proving that Indians are also invaders 
like the British invaders. The ultimate aim of these theories has 
clearly been stated by Lord Mc Caulay (British Parliament speech on 
2nd Feb. 1835 ...unless we break the backbone of this nation, which is 
her spiritual and cultural heritage, and therefore, I propose that we 
replace her old and ancient educational system, her culture for if the 
Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater 
than their own, they will lose their self esteem, their native culture 
and they will become what we want them....
<LI>Try to understand the true history of India and learn the good and
