<h2 align=center>My Pilgrimage to Gayatri Mantra</h2>

<p align=center>Dr. Manohar Abhay</p>

<p>The death of
my mother is one of the most shocking experiences I have ever had. Only three
days back, I had come back to Mumbai after staying with her for about a
fortnight. Though weak and feeble, due to age, she was responding to the
treatment and her condition was stable. The news of her sad demise left me
totally still. Heavily shivering and perspiring, I was crying like an infant.
Even at the cremation ground, I was inconsolable amidst hundreds of friends and
relatives who had gathered to console us. Suddenly, I was reminded of the <i>mantra</i>
which Ihave been chanting over the years.  My recitation of the <i>mantra</i>
was unintrupted.  I don't know how long it continued, but it gave me miraculous
strength to bear the grief. As if I was treading in tranquility. My thirst
started subsiding, in spite of the fact that it was hot summer and I had not
taken a single drop of water for more than twenty-four hours. </p>

<p><b>My Exposure</b><br>
I was exposed to <i>gayatri-mantra</i> at the age of 12.  It is said to be
the mother of <i>Vedas</i>. The <i>manu smriti</i> equates it with the Mouth
of God (see M S 2/81). The other day, when I was chanting the <i>mantra</i>, I
was reminded of the story of <i>Ushasti Chakrayana</i> given in <i>Chandogyopnishad</i>.
The essence of the story is that one should know the meaning of the <i>mantras
</i> before the chanting for invoking deities.(<i>taam Cheda vidvaanudgaasyasi
murdha te vipatisyatii -ChAndogya</i> IV-i.10).  This took me to a pleasant
sojourn to get an insight into the meaning of the <i>mantra</i>. </p>

<p><b>Gayatri in the Vedas</b><br>
The <i>gayatri mantra</i> is one of the most popular <i>Vedic</i> hymns.  It is
a poetic meter (<i>Rig-Veda</i>, tenth <i>mantra</i> in the 62nd <i>sutra</i>
of the third <i>mandal</i>). The meter consists of 24 syllables (letters),
three lines of eight syllables each. Any hymn composed in this meter is called <i>gayatri</i>.
The meter is also found in other <i>Vedas</i> though originally contained in <i>Rig-Veda</i>.(see
Yajurveda-22/9, 30/2,36/3;Samveda 1462) </p>

<p><b>Meaning of Gayatri</b><br>
The word <i>gayatri</i> is drived from <i>gAyantam-trAyate</i>(<i>gAyat+tra +ka
+yangip</i>); <i>gaya</i> that which is sung, given in praise,
<i>trayate</i> (root <i>trai </i>) that which preserves/protects/ gives
deliverance/grants liberation. The <i>gayatri</i> therefore, means -that- which
is adoration or praise of that which protects/preserves/grants liberation. Here
-that- stands for the <i>mantra</i> or the song. The word <i>gaya</i> also stands for vital energies.
Thus, <i>gAyatrI</i> may be deemed as a prayer of praise that awakens the vital
energies and grants liberation.  The <i>mantra</i> is said to have been composed
and developed by sage <i>Vishwamitra</i>.  Its <i>Vedic</i> name is <i>Savitri</i>,
as the hymn is addressed to <i>Savitur</i> (the sun). Nowhere the word <i>gayatri</i>
is mentioned in the body of the <i>mantra</i>. <i>Savitur</i> stands for
bright, luminous, sun like inner power of spiritual light or the one that brings
to self-realization. Thus, through <i>Savitur</i> the prayer is addressed to
the light of lights which exists in the inner most sheath of golden hue without
stain and without parts (<i>hiranmaye pare ko`se virajam brahma niShkalam, tachubhram
jyotisam jyotih -tad yadatma- vido viduh - Mundak-</i>II-2-9). </p>

<p><b>Three Dimensions</b><br>
The <i>mantra</i> has three dimensions: praise, meditation, 
and prayer. The praise
is of the bestower of happiness, the embodiment of knowledge and light. The
meditation is of the glory of the lord who is the remover of darkness, of
ignorance, pains, and of sorrows. The prayer finally is to the lord of light,
the most adorable, worthy of our solicitation and respect, to reflect light so
that our intellect is sharpened and all our ignorance is destroyed. </p>

<p><b>Original Mantra</b><br>
The mantra originally contained in Rig-Veda, having 24 syllables, reads as:<br>
<i>Tat Savitur Varenyam<br>
Bhurgo Devasya Dheemahi<br>
Dheeyo Yo Na Prachodayat</i></p>

<p><b>Word to Word Meaning</b><br>
The word to word meaning of the original mantra is as follows: <i>Tat</i>=That;
<i>Savitur</i>=Bright, luminous like sun; <i>Varenyam</i>=Best, choicest, the
excellent one, most adorable, fit to be worshipped, worthy of being so ught,
venerable; <i>Bhargo</i>= Destroyer of sins, or glory, radiance, effulgence, splendour
(that light which bestows intelligence); <i>Devasya</i>= Of the deity or divine
; <i>Dheemahi</i>=Meditate upon; <i>Dheeyo</i>=Intellect, noble thoughts,
intuition, understanding of reality ;<i>Yo</i>=He who, the one who; <i>Na</i>=
Our, of us; <i>Prachodayat</i> =May inspire, stimulate, sharpen, direct, guide,
unfold or he who energizes. </p>

<p>The literal
meaning of the mantra is: <b>&quot; We meditate upon (<i>dheemahi</i>) the splendour
or the glory (<i>bhargo</i>) of the most adorable (<i>varenyam</i>) Supreme-Divine-
Being (<i>devasya</i>) from which <i>Savitur</i> (the centre of light) is born.
Who (<i>yo</i>) may stimulate or sharpen (<i>prachdayat</i>) our (<i>na</i>)
intellect (<i>dheeyo</i>)&quot;</b> </p>

<p><b>Use of Pre-fix</b><br>
Before each offering in sacrifice (<i>yaj~na</i>) or before commencing any
spiritual ceremony, as part of invocat ion, all mantras are chanted with the
pre-fix: <i>Aum Bhur Bhuvaha Svah</i>, as per practice described in <i>Yajurveda</i>.
Therefore, the <i>Savitri</i> or the <i>gayatri mantra</i>, as it is popularly
known, is also chanted with the pre-fix of seven syllables of <i>Aum, Bhur, Bhuvah,
Svah</i> . Here AUM is the <i>naad</i> Brahman (primeval sound) emanating from
the Supreme at the time of creation. The remaining three words of <i>Bhur, Bhuvah
Suvah</i> represent the earth (matter), atmosphere and the space as symbols of
gross, subtle and casual or <i>sat, chit annanda</i> (truth, beauty and bliss
).  In the context of human body, these represent the three important parts of
the body: from feet to the navel centre is <i>bhur</i> (the earth), from navel
to throat centre is <i>bhuva</i> (the atmosphere), and from above the throat to
mind (<i>braham randh</i>) is <i>svaha</i> (the space). Enveloped by <i>aakaas</i>
(the space), there are seven realms (<i>lokas</i>) of existence viz: (1) <i>bhu</i>=earth,
the physical realm, the realm of being or food (matter);(2 )<i>bhuvah</i>=atmosphere,
the vital plane, the realm of becoming or <i>prana</i> (breath); (3) <i>suvah</i>=
space or heaven, the mental plane, the realm of illumination; (4) <i>maha</i>=cosmic
mind, the realm of <i>dharma</i>;(5) <i>janah</i>=bliss, the realm of
creation;(6) <i>tapah</i>=force, the realm of consciousness; (7) <i>satyam</i>=truth,
the realm of absolute reality. </p>

<p><b>Meaning With the Use of Pre-Fix</b><br>
With the pre-fix of four words, the <i>mantra</i> is comprised of four parts
(1) <i>Aum, Bhur Bhuvah, Suvah</i>,(2) <i>Tat Savitur Veranyam</i>,(3) <i>Bhargo
Devasya Dheemahi</i>, (4) <i>Dheeyo Yo Nah Prachodayat</i>. By chanting the first
part, one contemplates, to invoke certain powers, on the glory of the light
that illumines the three worlds namely; earth, atmosphere and space or the
gross, subtle and casual or the three realms of waking, dreaming, and sleep or
the three part s of the body (from feet to navel, navel to throat, throat to
mind). This prepares the ground for effective functioning of the second, third
and the fourth part o f the <i>mantra</i>. This is also an invocation to pay
reverence to the planes of our existence (the planes of our ordinary life- the
physical, astral and mental) and to invite their presiding deities to support
and help us. These three parts are in praise of the glory, the splendour that
flows from the light.  It is an invocation to <i>Savitur</i> (the centre of
light) for granting more light.  Indirectly, it is the Supreme-Conscious- Being
within the cosmic sun or light of lights, the creator of all forces, which is
praised here. </p>

<p>Taking
together all the four important parts of the <i>mantra</i>, its meaning reads
as follows:<br>
<b><i>We meditate (dheemahi) on the spiritual effulgence or glory (bhargo) of
that adorable supreme divine reality (varenyam devasya), the source or
projector (savitur) of the three phenomenal realms of the gross (bhur), the
subtle or the psychical (bhuvah) and the potential or casual(svah). May that(tat)Supreme-Divine-Being
stimulate (prachdayat) our (na) intellect (dheeo).</i> </b></p>

<p><b>Expanded Form of AUM</b><br>
The <i>gayatri mantra</i> is considered as an expanded form of AUM The syllable
used in the beginning and at the end of the <i>mantra</i> gives it a
reinforcing effect. This syllable says <i>kathopnishad</i>, is indeed <i>Brahman</i>;
indeed the highest; (III-1-3).  It is the best support. He who knows this support
becomes great in the world of <i>Brahma</i> (III-1-4) </p>

<p>As stated
earlier, AUM is the eternal sound emanated at the time of creation.  It is
composed of three syllables viz: A U M. The mind has three important states:
waking, dreaming, and sleeping. The word A, U, M represents all the three
states: A=waking, U=dreaming, M=sleeping. The last syllable M, when pronounced,
is followed by a deep silence and that is the fourth state of mind known a s <i>turiya</i>.
By chanting AUM the mind transcends from three states of waking, dreaming, and
sleeping to the fourth state of <i>turya</i> and experiences silence. When the
mind goes deep into the depths of this silence, it hears the cosmic sound of
AUM. This emanates from the <i>prana</i> (vital vibration) which fills the
universe. The scientists call this eternal sound as &quot;Big-Bang&quot;.
Tracing its scientific basis Dr Trucit Vora says: The sound produced due to the
fast moving earth, planets and galaxies is tremendous. Our galaxy called Milky
Way or <i>Akash- ganga</i> contains approximately 1, 00,000 millions of stars,
each star is like our sun having its own planet system. We know that the moon
moves round the earth and the earth moves round the sun along with the moon.
All planets move around the sun, each of the above bodies, revolves round at
its axis as well. Our sun along with its family takes one round of the galactic
centre in 250 million years. All galaxies, includi ng ours, are moving away at
a terrific velocity of 20,000 miles per second. We observe that an ordinary fan
makes noise when it moves with a speed of 900 RPM (Rotation per minute).  What a
great noise therefore, would be created when the galaxies move with a speed of
20,000 miles per second. The sound produced due to the fast-moving earth,
planets and galaxies is AUM, Dr Vora endorses. He also observes that the
infinite mass of galaxies, moving with a velocity of 20,000 miles per second,
generate a kinetic energy = 1/2 mv2 and this is balancing the total energy
consumption of the cosmos. Thus, the syllable AUM also represent energy and it
is called <i>pranavah</i> which means the body (<i>vapu </i>) or store house
of energy (<i>prana</i>). Recitation of <i>gayatri mantra</i> attracts only
PRAN and in the largest amount, one atom of <i>prana</i> is capable of holding
4845 tons of weight. According to Professor Alishagrgy, <i>Prana</i> travels
4,000 to 80,000 billion miles per second. T hus, by chanting AUM along with the
<i>mantra</i>, both in the beginning and at the end, we invoke the energy to
energies our intellect.  In her new book on <i>gayatri mantra</i>, Saadhvi Shanti
Mayi says that all energy and rejuvenating centers are activated by the sound
of the <i>gayatri mantra</i>.  It stimulates and facilitates insightfulness and
awakening to the Truth within all. She further says that the <i>mantra</i>
works in a multitude of ways, which align the energies, magnetic currents,
biochemistry and brain wave patterns on a very subtle level. Our energy
centers, levels and rhythms are activated by the measure of breaths that are
drawn in through the nostrils and released during recitation of the <i>gayatri
mantra</i>, (even during silent repetition). This balances electro-magnetic
rhythm and energy currents in the body with <i>prana</i>. During recitation,
all elements of the <i>mantra</i> are in use. The breath, voice, meditation and
intention efficiently and effortles sly function (like the sun shines).  It all
works together.  It also happens when the syllable AUM is chanted, whether
loudly or silently.  In fact, the syllable AUM represents that Power which (1)
is omniscient; (2) rules over the entire universe; (3) protects one from the
evils of life; and, (4) destroys ignorance and gives enlightenment. </p>

<p><b>Scientific Meaning</b><br>
Against the above backdrop, the scientific interpretation done by Dr. Trucit Vora
reads as follows:<br>
<b><i>The Earth (bhur), the planets (bhuvah), and the galaxies (svah) are
moving at a very great Velocity, the sound produced is AUM, (the name of
formless god). That god (tat) who manifests Himself in the form of light of sun
(savitur) is worthy of our bowing / respect and most adorable (varenyam). We
therefore, meditate (dheemahi ) upon the light (bhargo) of that deity (devasya)
And also do chanting of AUM. May he (yo) enlighten and inspire (prachodayat)
our (na) intellect (dheeo)</i></b>. </p>

<p><b>Personification</b><br>
A number of spiritual scholars have personified the mantra.  It is portrayed as
the goddess seated on a red lotus, having five heads, ten eyes, ten arms
equipped with all weapons. The goddess is also shown as accompanied by a swan
and having a book in one hand while conch in the other.  Indeed a beautiful
projection well decorated with multiple meaningful symbols. Many a learned
scholars have also suggested that while chanting the mantra one should wear
yellow clothes and sit on a yellow mat facing east. On a covered wooden seat
make a mound of rice grains dyed yellow. On the mount, place a coconut and tie
a sacred red- thread around the latter. Also apply a mark of red vermilion. On
the right side, place red rose- petals, a lamp (<i>Deepak</i>) and a conch (<i>shankh</i>).
Place on it incense, <i>Ghrit Deepak</i> (lamp filled with clarified
butter), flowers, rice- grains, vermilion etc.  Thereafter, start chanting the
mantra and all your wishes wou ld be fulfilled. All your desires for worldly
possessions, wealth and material benefits would be realized and you would
overcome all of your ailments and diseases. </p>

<p><b>In Quest of the Reality</b><br>
The aforesaid process of worship appears to be very good. But, there lies a
latent danger of limiting the chanters' sojourn to certain rituals, practices
and simply to idol worship for limited gains. His entire attention is likely to
be focused on the personified form of the <i>mantra</i> rather than on invoking
its inner power. There are four important aspects of the <i>mantra</i> which
need to be recollected viz: ((1) <i>tat vareNyam</i> (that adorable); (2) <i>bhargo
devasya</i> (glory of God, the destroyer of obstacles ;(3) <i>dheemahi</i> (we
meditate); (4) <i>dheeo yo na prachodayat</i> who may stimulate/ sharpen our
intellect). The entire emphasis of the mantra is on meditation. But, upon whom
to meditate: why to meditate; what purpose the meditation would serve. Many si milar
questions arise at this stage. </p>

<p>On
revisiting the <i>mantra</i>, it would be observed that the meditation is of
the glory of 'that' (<i>tat</i>) which is most adorable and the purpose is to
get the intellect stimulated/sharpened. Again there arise two very vital
questions: who is 'that' and why to get the intellect stimulated. </p>

<p>Prior to
meditation comes concentration-- concentration of mind. Because that most
adorable can be realized by the mind alone (<i>katho</i>. VI-ii-8) in the
highest state of meditation when the five instruments of knowledge stand still
together with the mind and the intellect itself does not stir (<i>katho</i>.  VII-ii-6)
The mind has two important layers: one, the outer layer which receives reflections/impulses
from the world of objects through the gates of knowledge, the five senses. The
second is the inner layer which reacts to the reflections received by the outer
layer. The former is known as <i>manah</i> or <i>manas</i> (mind) and the
latter one as <i>buddhi</i> (intellect). Both the layers, the mind and the
intellect, should work in unison. But, it seldom happens: <i>chanachalam hi manah
krisna</i>, says <i>Geeta</i>(see ChapterVI/34).  The mind verily is restless, it
is turbulent, strong and obstinate.  It moves along with the objects which it
likes and stays back from what it dislikes. Sense organs reflect the impulses
received from the world of object and our motor organs act according to the
directives given by the mind.  If the mind and the intellect are in unison correct
directives would be provided. Otherwise, the turbulent mind would lead to the
pathways where it wants to go. The senses should reflect the object which
brings the subtle body closer to the supreme goal of life. This needs to set in
motion a process where the senses are centered in the mind and the latter is
rooted in the sharp intellect which is centered in the cosmic intellect<i> (chittah).
</i>The next higher stage is the union of <i>chittah  </i>with the
Peaceful-Being <i>(Shant Aatman) </i>known as <i>Isvara</i>.  This long journey is
more subtle than concentrating on a personified figure and making offerings of
material things in abundance. Only those who wish worldly success or
satisfaction from sense-objects make sacrifice to gods because satisfaction is
quickly obtained from actions in the world -of -objects, says <i>Geeta(kaankshantah
karmaam siddhim yajanta iha devataah.  IV/12).</i>But, those who are on a
pilgrimage passing through gross to subtler than the subtle islands of higher
knowledge do not indulge in practicing rituals only or performing outworldly
actions. Their voyage is to gain wisdom which is enveloped by ignorance (ajanaanenaa
vritam janaanam | Geeta:V/15). </p>

<p><b>Effective Meditation</b><br>
There are five fundamentals for an effective meditation viz: (1) the goal ;(2)
sensory withdrawal; (3) concentration; (4) breath control; (5) and the mantra.
Elaborating these five elements, <i>Acharya Pranakrishnanda Avadhut</i> of the Anand
Marg says: a mantra when chanted internally resonate with the individuals
initiative rhythm and gradually transforms it into the infinite straight line
of supreme peace. He further says, by the repetition of the proper acoustic
vibration following the breath with sentimental understanding of the meaning,
the power of the mantra awakens the spiritual potentiality in the mind and body
and it brings the ego in the union with the Supreme. Concentration therefore,
should be on the mantra rather than on any worldly object or an idol. The
meditation, on the other hand, needs to be on the glory of the most adorable
whose radiance shines in the <i>savitur</i>.  In vedic literature<i>, Savitur </i>is
known by multiple <i>names (pushanney karshey yama surya prajapatya-Isa-16)</i>.
It is <i>pusha</i> as it nourishes the world, a sole seer because it commands
or moves alone.  It is controller of all, as it is <i>yama</i> (lord of death).
It is <i>surya</i>, because its rays absorb <i>prana</i> (vital force) and<i> rasa
</i>(juice). Here the prayer is not made simply to the lord of light, the sun
that we behold in the space but to &quot;that&quot;(&quot;tat&quot;) who is
here in man and who is yonder in the <i>sun (sa yasachaayamam purushye yschaa saa
vaaditye -Taittriya V(III-10)</i>. Who is pure and like the light within the
body <i>(antah-saeerye jyotir-mayo hi subhro-MundakV--III-1).</i>Who is inside
of all this and (also) outside of all this <i>(tadantrasya savasya tadu sarv syaasy
bahyatah -Isha.5).</i>Whose face, in the centre of the radiance, is covered
with the golden disc <i>(hiraNmayen pAtreNa satya syaapihitam mukham -Isha 15</i>)
and most propitious is His face<i> (tejoyate rupam kalyaantam tatte pashyaami yo
asaa vasau puruShah so.ahamasmi-- Isha-16</i>).  The prayer thus, is to discover
the truth, the Absolute Reality, through <i>Savitur (tattuam pushann paavrnu satyadharmaay
drastye--Isa--15</i> </p>

<p>Thus the purpose
of the meditation is to realize the Absolute Reality-to see the Self-indwelling
who is seen by the subtle seers through their sharp and subtle intellect <i>alone
(drashytye tuavyayaa budhayaa sukchma yaa sukcham darshiarbhi:katho.  III-22).</i>
The emphasis is on subtle and sharp intellect He is not seen or gained by the
weak nor by the insincere nor by those practising penances or austerities but
by wise men who strive with vigour, attention and prosperity <i>(naayam aatmaa
bala-hinena labhyo-mundaka III .ii-4).</i> With weak intellect one can not
realize the Self - indwelling. By means of the light of the intellect, says shruti,
one should know the truth of the <i>aatman</i> (see <i>Mundak</i> III-i-9). He
is seen repeats <i>upanishads</i>, neither by following certain rituals nor by
practicing penance but by meditating upon that most adorable when the intellect
becomes calm and refined (<i>na-anyair-devais-tapasaa-karmanaa vaa - Mundak
III-i-8</i>). </p>

<p><b>Mantra and Worldly Wealth</b><br>
While there are many mantras where the divine power is prayed to provide
material comforts, in <i>gayatri </i>mantra, as has been said earlier, an
appeal is made to foster and sharpen the knowledge yielding faculty, the
intellect or the discriminating power. When one is endowed with sharp
intellect, the material things are not far beyond his reach. And also, `for
who's indeed is wealth`(<i>kashyas dhanam</i>), says <i>upan ishada </i>(Isa
1).  None can be satisfied with the wealth, replied Nachiketa when he was
offered, by yama, wealth and long life, herds of cattle, gold and horses and
fair maidens with their chariot and musical instrument. All this, Nachiketa
said, is transient and wear out the vigour of all the senses (<i>shvuabhaavaa mataraya
sya yadant kait tatsarvye indryaanaam jaryanti teja--Katho-I i-24</i>).
Therefore, one should pray that intellect which brings him closer to tejas--the
splendour rather than thin gs which are transient. By getting sharp intellect
one can gain knowledge and by right knowledge that Self is gained .  When the
intellect is purified by the serene light of knowledge, through meditation, he
can see Him who is without parts (<i>gyaan prasaaden vishudh satva isatastu tam
pasyantye niskalam dhaayamaanah-Mundak -V-III-8</i>).  All the doors and windows
of prosperity are opened.  He is neither trapped in the worldly problems nor
does he tread a wrong path. The sharp and righteous intellect provides
righteous solutions to his problems. The wisdom of <i>Bhrigu</i> (<i>Taattriy </i>V-III-5)
tells us that the spirit in men manifests itself as intellect and perfect bliss
is Brahman (<i>vigyaanam brhamyeti vayjaanaat vigyaanaadh yeav khalivemaani bhutaani
jaayantye</i>). Starting from <i>annam</i>, men's quest for perfect bliss
passes through <i>prana </i>(vital breath), <i>manas</i> (consciousness), vijnana
(intellect).<i>yetam vijaan mya maatamaana mupasaynakramya-Tattriy </i>a V(III-1).  Then
he proceeds to the Self which consists of understanding/intellect and then to
the Self which consist of bliss and goes up and down the worlds eating the food
he desires and assuming the form he desires. He who knows this becomes rich in
food .  He becomes great in offspring and cattle and in the splendour of sacred
knowledge and great in fame (<i>mahaanbhavapti prajyaa pashubhiarbrahman varchsen
mahaankeertya-Taittiri V-III-10</i>). </p>

<p>Verily, it
is not for the sake of the wealth that wealth is dear, said <i>Yajnavalkya</i>
(<i>Brihadaranyak</i> IV-II-1-9), when his wife enquired: ' Would I be immortal
through it, if the entire earth filled with wealth was mine.' 'For the sake of
the Self is the wealth dear, said the Seer'.  It is the Self that should be
discovered or realized, not the material wealth. The sharpening of intellect in
essence, is illumination of our subtle world of consciousness.  In our inner
world <i>savitur</i>, the bestower of light is <i>aatman</i> . As the entire
solar system moves around the sun, in the same way, the entire subtle world of
our senses, mind, intellect, and ego revolves around <i>aatamn</i> (the spirit
or the soul). Without this centres of radiance all other physical elements, the
body, senses, mind intellect are all dead or meaningless, as the universe is
dark and dead without the <i>savitur</i>. </p>

<p><b>Light of Lights</b><br>
By getting the intellect sharpened, the <i>gayatri mantra </i>invokes our
voyage to self-realization. However, getting the intellect sharpened or
stimulated is not an end in itself.  It is the brilliance, the intelligence or
the thinker behind that needs to be explored. The intellect is just an
instrument, a means to move further, it is a pathway, a by lane that leads to
the end of the tunnel where shines a very pleasing, pleasant, soothing and cool
light. When the intellect is stimulated or purified or sharpened, the Self
shines forth in its own resplendency (see <i>Mundak</i>-III- i-9: <i>eso-anuraatma
</i>cheats <i>veditavyo</i>). The subtle truth of the<i> aatman</i> within the
body is revealed only with the backup of a purified intellect. The bondage of
the non-Self, says <i>Adi Shankara </i>in his famous treatise <i>vivekachUDAmaNI</i>,
springs from ignorance. This bondage can be destroyed neither by weapons nor by
wind, nor by fire, nor by millions of acts (desireful acts or rituals enjoined
by the scriptures) except the wonderful sword of knowledge that comes of
discrimination (<i>vivekachUDAmaNI</i>-147). </p>
