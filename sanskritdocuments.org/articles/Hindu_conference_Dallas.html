DALLAS, TEXAS, October 14, 2007: What happens when 200 men and women, all
sharing a profound love of Hindu dharma, meet for three days in East Texas,
site of John Kennedy's assassination deep in the Bible Belt? The fifth
annual Human Empowerment Conference (HEC) concluded here today. The 200
spiritual and community leaders, scholars, academicians and activists
attended the intense, three-day conclave, examining some of the most
pressing issues facing the Hindu community today. Sponsored by the Sanatana
Dharma Foundation of Dallas, (click here), the conference's name comes from
the Vedic dictate, Krunvanto Vishwam Aryam, "Ennoble all humanity."
<P>
Hinduism Today magazine and Hindu Press International editors, Paramacharya
Palaniswami and Sannyasin Arumugaswami, flew in from Hawaii for the event
and filed this report. The conference had dozens of parallel sessions, so
the report covers the ones th ey were actually present for, while giving
only an brief mention of the rest.
<P>
The sessions began midday on October 12 with a welcome address from Kashi
Viswanathan, president of the Sanatana Dharma Foundation, followed by
overviews of the ten major sessions:

The major presentations of the first afternoon included the California
textbook controversy given by Paramacharya Palaniswami of Hinduism Today
(click here for a short version of this presentation). This was a broad
overview of the contentious adoption of sixth grade social study texts in
California in which Hindus fought for parity so that Hinduism was presented
in the same positive manner as the other religions. It was followed by a
presentation of the educational initiatives of the India-based Shruti
Foundation given by Ms. Shruti, a remarkable attempt to inculcate pride in
Indic genius, particularly Hindu methodologies of integral living,
education, scientific thought, societal organization, ethics and work
dynamics. She pointed out that following India's independence, the communist
parties sought and were given control of the education system in the early
1950s. The long-term consequence of this control is that academia in India
is, even to this day, permeated with Marxist philosophy which is extremely
antagonistic toward any religion, and Hinduism in particular. One aspect of
this communist domination is what she terms "Sanskritphobia," with a
diminishing of Sanskrit studies which she regards as a major reason for the
decline of Hinduism. In January, 2008, her foundation will hold a major
conference in Delhi as part of their efforts to rebuild pride and the
knowledge base that was India's in the past.
<P>
The evening sessions were focused around the life's work of Sita Ram Goel,
one of the great Hindu thinkers and activists of the 20th century. The main
lecture of the evening was by Dr. Valerie Tarico, a Seattle psychologist
specially invited by the organizers to speak on Christian fundamentalism and
evangelism. Her talk was riveting, as she herself came from a family of
evangelists and early in life was a "true believer." She explained that it
is these evangelists, the fundamentalists of Christianity, who are trying to
convert the people of India. They are driven in their attempts by a belief
in the Great Commiss ion, the idea in the New Testament that Christians are
obliged to preach and convert all the peoples of the world.
<P>
Dr. Tarico did a scathing analysis of evangelical beliefs, beginning with
the monotheism/Trinity of God conundrum and ending with their belief in
Biblical inerrancy, that every single word of the Bible is true, even the
most horrible punishments and genocide ordered by God. "These beliefs are
not rational, not coherent," she boldly asserted.
<P>
She warned Hindus that evangelicals have the power of American innovation
behind them, marketing their product, Christian fundamentalism, with all the
savvy of the most sophisticated Western corporation. She said Hindus should
regard the belief system of these fundamentalists as a force as deadly as
drugs. In her conclusion, Dr. Tarico urged Hindus to "be more evangelical
about what you do and know, especially your religious pluralism." "Right
now, Hinduism is thought of as an antiquated bunch of people who think
statues are God. But I think Hinduism offers a path, a power to sow the
seeds of wisdom that we need. You need to evang elize the ideal of dharma to
counteract the existing stereotypes of Hindu belief."
<P>
There was an intermission for fundraising by the organizers, which in a
kinetic ten minutes succeeded in raising pledges of over $15,000, matched by
an anonymous patron to bring it to $30,000.
<P>
Sannyasin Arumugaswami, managing editor of Hinduism Today, followed with a
presentation on "Proselytization and Religious Freedom" (click here for a
video version) which complemented Dr. Tarico's lecture with specifics on the
methods of the evangelists.
<P>
Next came Dr. David Frawley's address on "The Need for Pluralism in
Religion." In explaining that Hindus from India often do not understand
Christianity in the West because, "The Christianity found in India is much
more backward than that found in the West."
<P>
The final talk of the evening was "Hinduphobia" by R ajiv Malhotra. His
wide-ranging and provocative discourse began with the thesis that the
California sixth grade social studies textbooks deliberately hide the
positive aspects of Hinduism, such as yoga, vegetarianism, music, etc., in
order to "demonize the culture." The whole of South Asian studies today in
the West, he stated, were divisive, emphasizing, and in some cases,
creating, division between Dalits and brahmins, Dravidians and Aryans, women
and men, minorities and Hindus. "India's problems are not seen as
historical, or economic, but the result of a flawed culture, a flawed DNA."
He explained how his analysis found three specialties in Hinduism: caste,
minorities and women, all of them negative. He complained about the tendency
toward deconstruction by scholars who claim "India is not even a nation
state at all." Those same scholars turn this same strategy against Hinduism
by claiming it is a product of 19th century British scholars and not a
religion at all. "India is the only major civilization whose study has been
controlled from the outside," he lamented, and compared the situation to
that of China, whose government has sponsored hundreds of Confucian
institutions which are the main force in scholastic investigation of China.
<P>
Malhotra pointed out that "to fight for our rights is the American way," and
encouraged Hindus to become more active in supporting positive study on
India and countering pervasive foreign interpretations. "Once we were
knowledge producers and exporters throughout Asia," he said, "now we are
consumers of knowledge about ourselves."
<P>
The Hinduism Today team in attendance made presentations on conversion to
Hinduism with special attention to the situation of mixed religious
marriages between a Hindu and a non-Hindu. The point made was that in such
marriages the children tend to grow up with no religion at all, unless the
non-Hindu spouse agrees to convert to Hinduism, or at least to raise the
children as Hindus. Too many couples, it was pointed out, leave the choice
of religion to the child, which usually results in the child's choosing
"none of the above." Intermarriage is a common issue for all religions, with
40% of Catholics and Jewish children marrying outside the faith (both of
which actively discourage intermarriage). The children of those marriages
commonly growing up without religion.
<P>
A second presentation by Hinduism Today was in the session on pacifism, the
primary point being that the dharmic ideal of ahimsa does not mean the
individual Hindu or the Hindu state should be pacifist. It is our duty to
actively assure protection of the home and the country. Participants in the
session were deeply concerned about what they consider a pacifist attitude
in the conduct of Indian foreign and domestic policy, which has result in
the country's being threatened by internal rebellions and external threats
along her borders. The ideal of individual nonviolence was affirmed by most
present, while acknowledging that force may be necessary to defend the
homeland, and such force is not outside of dharma.
<P>
Palaniswami offered a graphically-rich presentation on "Religion and the
Media," explaining the pragmatic realities of how the media works and how
Hindus can best interact with it. (Click here for a video of an earlier
presentation given in Montreal, Canada). Hindus were encouraged to
understand the media, what it considers news, what its biases and pressure s
are, so as to be able to work with the media and not fight it. A proven and
proactive approach is getting to know the religion editor of the local
newspaper, slowly creating strong relationships and making inroads with the
media. This can be amplified by a constant, low key, benign presence of
Hinduism in the local media. A fascinating aspect of this presentation
showed the covers of Time magazine from the 1930s (Gandhi) to the present
day, and how they reflected the good, the bad and the ugly of Western
attitude toward India.
<P>
Dr. Ramdas Lamb of the University of Hawaii followed with a presentation on
media and academia. He explained that the professors of religion in the West
are either Christians or Marxists. "If you say something positive about
Hinduism, you are immediately marginalized and branded 'Hindutva.' The
academic is as biased as the media." He explained how academia is driven by
funding, and how an academic study that would put Hinduism in a positiv e
light will simply not get funds, whereas one taking a critical Marxist
approach will. Because of this, he added, a lot of young Hindu scholars
either abandon Indology, get co-opted by the secular and Marxist academics
or, as he put it, "go into the closest," ie, hide their Hindu personal life.
As a result, he noted that hardly five percent of the people who teach
Hinduism in the West are practicing Hindus -- a situation completely
different than that of Jewish, Catholic, Black or woman's studies, where
nearly everyone is part of the tradition or community they study. Dr. Lamb,
who is openly Hindu, pleaded with the community to fund scholarships and
university chairs in Hindu studies. Asked if there is any school in America
where a practicing Hindu can get a PhD in Hinduism, he offered, "No, but at
my school you can get a master's."
<P>
On Saturday, the general session centerpiece was a brilliant talk by Rajiv
Malhotra, founder of the Infinity Foundation, who unveile d his "U-Turn
Theory," the phenomenon whereby Western academics or scientists study
something from India, and ultimately claim it as their own. For example,
there have been recent studies on the effect of breathing techniques and
meditation upon health and well-being. These techniques were developed
centuries ago by India's gifted yogis. But what happens today is that a
Western scientist studies such techniques in laboratories, determine they
work, publish a report and receive personal fame and glory (and money) as if
he had discovered the technique in the first place. The true genius, the
yogi who perfected the practice, is unnamed and unknown. "It is like the
referee holding the stopwatch at the Olympic 100 meter dash receiving the
gold medal because he timed the winning runner," quipped Malhotra. He went
on to inventory a massive list of such "discoveries," from techniques of
yoga and meditation to ayurveda. The catalog of inventions, processes,
techniques and wisdom insi ghts that have been appropriated from India was
impressive, even startling.
<P>
As with all conferences, much of the real action took place in crowded
halls, fueled by animated discussions between (and often during!) the
general and parallel sessions. Over all, the conference seemed to fulfill
its mandate which is described as:
<P>
"The intersection between academicians, scholars and activists represents a
unique and potent combination that is probably the most important
distinguishing characteristic of the HEC conference. It is not merely a
place where ideas are shared, written into papers and published into a
magazine. Nor is it a convention of any specific activist organization,
which celebrates its internal victories and deliberates its challenges. The
confluence of 'Thought Leadership' and 'Activism Orientation' allows for the
germination of new ideas, their fructification into real world projects and
eventually into a measurable impact on the community at large." That's what
happened in the Lone Star State, land of the Cotton Bowl.
