<b><center>9. Manvantaras (Hinduism)</center></b>
<P>Each manvantara is ruled over by a Manu and there are fourteen manvantaras in any kalpa.  The gods (devas), the seven great sages (saptarshis), and the Indra, change from one manvantara to another.
<P>The first Manu was Svayambhuva.  The names of the gods then were yama and the names of the seven sages were Marichi, Atri, Angira, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vashishtha.
<P>The second Manu was Svarochisha.  The names of the gods then were tushita and the names of the seven sages were Agnidhra, Agnivaha, Medha, Medhatithi, Vasu, Jyotisvana and Dyutimana.
<P>The third Manu was Outtama.  The names of the gods then were rishabha and the names of the seven sages were the urjjas.  (The individual names of the sages are not given).
<P>The fourth Manu was Tamasa.  The names of the gods then were satya and the names of the seven sages were Gargya, Prithu, Agni, J anya, Dhata, Kapinka and Kapivana.
The fifth manu was Raivata.  The names of the gods then were raibhya and the names of the seven sages were Vedavahu, Jaya, Muni, Vedashira, Hiranyaroma, Parjanya and Urddhavahu.
The sixth Manu was Chakshusha.  There were five types of gods in the sixth manvantara and their names were adya, prasuta, ribhu, prithugra and lekha.  The names of the seven sages were Bhrigu, Naha, Vivasvana, Sudharma, Viraja, Atinama, and Asashishnu.
<P>The seventh manvantara is the manvanatara that is now going on.  The seventh Manu is Vaivasvata.  The names of the seven sages are Atri, Vashishtha, Bhavya, Kashyapa, Goutama, Bharadvaja and Vishvamitra.
<P>The remaining seven manvantaras will come in the future.

But the names of the seven sages of the eig hth manvantara are Viravana, Avanivana, Sumantra, Dhritimana, Vasu, Varishnu and Arya.
<P>The nine Manu will be Rohita.  The names of the seven sages will be Medhatithi, Vasu, Bhargava, Angira, Savana, Havya and Poulaha.
<P>The tenth Manu will be Merusavarni.  The names of the gods then will be dvishimanta and the names of the seven sages will be Havishmana.  Pulaha, Sukriti, Ayomukti, Vashishtha, Prayati and Nabhara.
<P>The eleventh Manu will be Brahmasavarni.  The names of the seven sages will be Havishmana, Kashyapa, Vapushmana, Varuna, Atreya, Anagha and Angira.
<P>The twelfth Manu will be Dharmasvarni.  The names of the sages will be Dyuti, Atreye, Angira, Tapasvai, Kashyapa, Taposhana and Taporati.
<P>The thirteenth Manu will be Rouchya.  The names of the seven sages will be Kashyapa, Magadha, Ativahya, Angirasa, Atreya, Vashishtha and Ajita.
