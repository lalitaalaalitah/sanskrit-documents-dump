<H1> <EM>AANANDA&#58</EM> BLISS</H1>
<H2><EM>Sri Kanchi Mahaswami</EM>  &#39s Discourses </H2>
<H3>(English translation by P.N. Ramachandran) </H3>

<P><FONT face=Arial>(The <EM>Mahaswami 
</EM>(late) <EM>Sri Chandrasekharendra Sarasvati Swami</EM>    
   is considered a saint of recent times. His 
discourses on various topics while on a visit to Madras in 1930&#39s are indeed the 
benchmark.) </FONT>          
</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>In the <EM>Krita Yuga</EM> (the first of four ages or eons in 
which time is divided in India), <EM>Bhrigu</EM> asked <EM>Varuna</EM>, his father and teacher 
thus: “How to gain knowledge of That from which beings and entities 
originate and to which they return”. The teacher exhorted the disciple to 
practice <EM>tapas</EM> (supreme concentration of the energies of the mind and the 
senses) because that is the means to the attainment of the knowledge of 
<EM>Brahman</EM> (Supreme God).</FONT>            
</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>At the fifth stage, <EM>Bhrigu</EM> told his father and teacher that 
he was on occasion enjoying spells of bliss. What was that? The teacher explained 
that the occasional spell of bliss was the Ultimate Reality (<EM>Aananda</EM>). “It now 
occurs to you in droplets. If this becomes full, it is then known as 
<EM>Brahmaanandam</EM> (Infinite Bliss.) That Infinite Bliss will always remain complete 
and not have shortage at all. It is an entity extending across all time and all 
materials. There is an entity named <EM>Aatma</EM> (Self.) This <EM>Aatma</EM> is the basis for body, 
<EM>praana</EM>, <EM>manas</EM> and <EM>vijnaana</EM>. But it is beyond all these. The 
<EM>Aatma</EM> realizes itself and experiences enjoyment in itself. That happiness or 
pleasure is the cause for the occasional <EM>Aananada</EM> enjoyed by you.”</FONT> 
</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG>Thus goes the story of the <EM>Taittireeya Upanishad</EM></STRONG></FONT>           
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>We get only a drop of that Infinite Bliss occasionally. 
A tree with large branches and thick foliage hardly allows any sunlight to pass 
through. If the leaves move about due to breeze, then, a little sunlight shines 
through the gap in the leaves and shows up on the ground under the tree. 
The sunlight again gets covered after a while.</FONT>              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Similarly the feeling of bliss comes to us only occasionally. 
Infinite Bliss is an all-pervading entity. But our past <EM>karma</EM> (effect of actions) 
and bad qualities of mind and intellect hide that Bliss from us. For the moment 
when our good deeds prevail as in the case of the sunlight filtering through the 
leaves, we do get droplet of that Bliss. This leads to our experience of happiness 
or pleasure. If we continue to think out deeply as in <EM>tapas</EM>, we may get 
united with, and become one with that Infinite Bliss.</FONT>              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><EM>KRISHNA</EM> SAYS: <EM>Aatma</EM> (Self) is the basis for all 
entities. But doubts arise about the statement that the <EM>Aatma</EM> is beyond 
everything. In the <EM>Bhagavad-Geeta, Sri Krishna</EM> has created many such doubts 
but has finally clarified them all.</FONT>              
</P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG><EM>Yo Maam Pasyati Sarvatra<BR>
Sarvam Cha Mayi Pasyati |<BR></STRONG>
{Geeta VI (30)}</EM></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>&#34I am in all entities. All entities are in me&#34. 
The second part suggests that He (God) is the basis for all entities. 
On the other hand, does the first part mean that all entities are the basis 
for Him (God)? Which is correct?</FONT>              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The correct interpretation is that <EM>Swaami</EM> or God is 
the basis for all things. God is inside everything. This does not mean that 
they support/bear Him. They got their shape and life from Him (God). 
They will not exist if there is no God. Therefore they are not the basis for 
Him (God).  He (God) alone is the Lord of everything.</FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone&#39s heart. He is directing 
their wanderings as if they were on the puppeteer&#39s rotating machine. 
<EM>Sri Krishna</EM> thus clarified the correct position. </FONT>

</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>&#34I pervade the whole creation. All things are resting in Me, 
but I am not in them.&#34 Here the principle that the <EM>Aatma</EM> is beyond everything 
is established.</FONT>              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG><EM>Naaham Prakaasaha Sarvasya<BR>

{Geeta VII (25)}</EM></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>&#34I am never manifest to all. That is due to my <EM>Yoga-Maaya</EM> 
(<EM>Ma</EM>-is not and <EM>Ya</EM>-that which).&#34 [<EM>Maya</EM> is neither real nor 
unreal; it is of a third category.]</FONT>              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>On deep consideration one can clear the doubts. Had 
<EM>Sri Krishna</EM> stated, &#34I cannot be perceived by any one at all&#34; 
it would mean &#34if there were one thousand persons I cannot be perceived by all 
those thousand persons.&#34  But <EM>Sri Krishna</EM> has said, &#34I cannot be 
perceived by all.&#34This could mean &#34May be for 999 persons out of the thousand, 
I am not manifest; I may be perceived by at least one out of the thousand.&#34 The 
crucial term in the sloka is <EM>&#34Sarvasya&#34</EM> (not manifest to all) and not 
&#34<EM>Kasyaapi</EM>&#34 (none at all). That would mean that God could be 
perceived by a few.</FONT>              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Who are these few persons? These are the seers who are not 
affected by the <EM>Yoga-Maaya</EM> indicated by <EM>Sri Krishna</EM>. These seers have 
clarified the apparent contradiction in the <EM>Geeta</EM> sequences referred to above.</FONT>              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the dusk if a garland of flowers is lying on the ground, 
it may appear as a snake to the passer-by. The garland and the apparent snake are 
one and the same. When the garland is recognized the apparent snake will go. 
Thus for the appearance the garland was the basis.</FONT>              
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Just as the garland is mistaken for the snake, 
the unintelligent persons, due to delusion, see the different Universes in the 
place of the single <EM>Brahman</EM> (Supreme God). In fact <EM>Brahman</EM> 
(Supreme God) is the basis for the entire Universe. What is the meaning of the 
statements &#34I am in all things. All things are in me&#34? </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>In the illustration of the garland-snake, garland is the 
substrate; the snake is what is super-imposed. For the terrified person, the snake 
has disappeared into the garland. At that stage snake is the base in his view. 
If his ignorance is removed and he realizes that it is only a garland, the garland 
has hidden the snake into itself. Then the garland becomes the base.</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The unintelligent person looks on the Universe as the Truth; 
but in reality, God is the basis and support for the Universe. The seer has 
removed the false appearance (the Universe) from his mind. For him <EM>Brahman</EM> 
(Supreme God) is everything, including he (the seer) himself. The seer, 
in his <EM>nirvikalpa samaadhi</EM> (impersonal, unconditioned state), does not perceive 
the Universe as an appearance even, apart from the Supreme God. When the Universe 
itself is non-existent, the question of the Universe being inside the 
Supreme God or of the latter being inside the former does not arise at all</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>When one is unaware of Reality, one perceives the body, 
vital principle of life, mind, intellect etc. Full realization of Truth comes 
only when occasional sparks of bliss arise beyond the above material/immaterial 
perceptions. Thus <EM>Sri Krishna</EM> has stated, in the ultimate stand of the seer, 
as follows &#34I pervade the whole universe. All things are resting in Me, but I am 
not in them.&#34 If an ignorant person had looked upon the garland as the snake, 
how can one say, in reality, that the snake was inside the garland or that the 
garland was inside the snake? <EM>Kambar</EM>, the great Tamil poet and composer of the 
Classic <EM>Kamba Ramaayanam</EM> has stated as follows:</FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial><STRONG><EM>Alangalil Thondrum Poymai<BR>
Aravu Enapp Pootham Aidum<BR>
Vilangiya Vikaarap Paattin<BR>
Veruppaadutra Veekkam<BR>
Kalanguva Devaraik Kandaal<BR>
Avar Enbar Kaivil Endi<BR>

(Sundara-Kaandam)
</EM></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>The illustration of garland appearing as snake in the dusk is 
again referred to here. Similarly the inflated feeling of difference 
(between the universe and us) appears on account of the mixture of the five elements. 
This differentiation or dual appearance (of the world and the individual) is not 
true. If He is known by whom all these appearances will disappear, then as in 
the garland-snake example, the delusion will go and the garland, namely the 
Supreme God will be perceived. That absolute reality as declared by the 
<EM>Vedas</EM> (Holy Scriptures) is <EM>Sri Rama</EM> who fought <EM>Ravana</EM> 
in <EM>Sri Lanka</EM>. The universe is made of the five elements. Its substrate is 
<EM>Sri Rama</EM>. If the appearance goes or is reduced, then, what remains is only 
the truth of the Supreme Self. This is the gist of <EM>Kambar</EM>&#39s statement in 
this poem </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>As a follower of the <EM>Vaishnava</EM> (worshipper of <EM>Vishnu</EM>) 
sect, <EM>Kambar</EM> might have subscribed to a different theory. But here <EM>Kambar</EM> 
has enunciated clearly the principle of <EM>Advaita</EM> (non-duality).</FONT>
