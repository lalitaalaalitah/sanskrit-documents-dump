<H1><EM>JNAANAAMBIKA:</EM> DIVINE MOTHER – SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE PERSONIFIED</H1>
<H2><EM>Shri Kanchi Mahaswami</EM> 's Discourses </H2>
<H3>(English translation by P.N. Ramachandran) </H3>

<P><FONT face=Arial>(The <EM>Mahaswami </EM>(late) <EM>Shri Chandrasekharendra 
Sarasvati Swami</EM> is considered a saint of recent times. His discourses on 
various topics while on a visit to Madras in 1930's are indeed the benchmark.) 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Once, in the war between <EM>Devas</EM> (gods) and <EM>asuras</EM> (demons, representing the forces of darkness), 
<EM>Brahman</EM> (Supreme God) obtained the victory for <EM>devas</EM>. But the <EM>devas</EM> became elated and thought; ours, indeed, is this victory.  
To save them from this vanity, <EM>Brahman</EM> appeared before them as a <EM>Yaksha</EM> (Venerable Being). To find out who the <EM>Yaksha</EM> 
was, the gods sent first <EM>Agni</EM> (God of Fire) and then <EM>Vayu</EM> (God of Wind). Both these gods returned, not being able to ascertain 
who the <EM>Yaksha</EM> was.
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Then the gods requested their leader, <EM>Indra</EM>, to obtain the answer. On his approach, the <EM>Yaksha</EM> disappeared 
from view. In that very space, <EM>Indra</EM> beheld the resplendent <EM>Uma</EM>, the <EM>Himavathi</EM> (<EM>Parvathi</EM>, Shiva’s consort, 
wearing many gold ornaments or the daughter of <EM>Himavan</EM>, the snow-clad Himalayan mountain). <EM>Adi Shankaracharya</EM> in his 
<EM>Bhashya</EM> (commentary) states: <EM>Vidya</EM>, or spiritual knowledge, is the most splendid of all splendors. That knowledge personified 
as <EM>Uma</EM>, dressed in gold ornaments, shows herself to <EM>Indra</EM>.
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>
<EM>Uma</EM> instructs <EM>Indra</EM> thus: That <EM>Yaksha</EM> was <EM>Brahman</EM> itself. That alone was the origin and base for the entire 
universe, yourself, other <EM>devas</EM> and all <EM>asuras</EM>. That indivisible energy is residing in all beings in varying lots.
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><EM>Thus goes the story of the Kena Upanishad.</EM></FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Just as the flower and the smell, milk and taste, or fire and brightness, the Divine Mother is the power of knowledge, 
inseparable from <EM>Shri Parama Shiva</EM>. Likewise she is in an inseparate mode as sister of <EM>Shri Narayana</EM>. She was <EM>Vaishnavi</EM> 
while eliminating the <EM>asuras</EM> (forces of darkness) as <EM>Durga</EM>.  This <EM>Devi</EM> (Divine Mother) was born from 
<EM>Yasoda</EM>’s womb as <EM>Vishnu Maya</EM>, during <EM>Shri Krishna Jayanthi</EM> (birthday celebrations). We worship <EM>Durga</EM> during 
the nine nights (<EM>navarathri</EM>) in the autumn. After the elimination of the <EM>asuras</EM>, she has to encourage the good and the 
spiritual knowledge. To celebrate the appearance of the <EM>Devi</EM> as <EM>Jnaanambika</EM>, we celebrate another nine nights as 
<EM>Vasantha navarathri</EM> in the spring after <EM>Shri Rama Navami</EM>. 
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>We worship during the spring nine nights as the peaceful <EM>Jnaanaambika</EM> the same <EM>Devi</EM> (Divine Mother) 
whom we worshipped as the fierce <EM>Chandika</EM> (another name of the Divine Mother) during the autumn nine nights. She eliminates the 
forces of darkness as <EM>Chandika</EM> and protects all by teaching the good and spiritual knowledge as <EM>Jnaanaambika</EM>.   
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>A large wave spends itself by repeated bending. In the same manner, there are some sounds. Many such combinations of 
sounds are divided into fifty-one letters. These are called “<EM>Maatruka</EM>”. “<EM>Maatru</EM>” means mother. The Divine Mother is both 
sound as well as letters. She is also the <EM>Pranava Mantra</EM> (inspired words having divine connotation). The letters <EM>ah</EM>, 
<EM>wu</EM>, and <EM>ma</EM>, combine into the <EM>mantra Om</EM>. <EM>Ah</EM> – creation; <EM>wu</EM> – maintenance; and <EM>ma</EM> – 
destruction. Thus <EM>Uma</EM> combines the three divine functions into herself. So her denomination as such in the <EM>Upanishads</EM>.
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>The Divine Mother’s body is made up of musical notes, pleasant sounds, attractive voices – the fifty-one letters themselves 
form her body. It is made up entirely of knowledge. This knowledge is known as <EM>Jnaanaambika</EM> (spiritual knowledge personified.)
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>One should not look upon as constant and permanent, all those changing entities or those subject to destruction. 
Instead one should learn by intuition and personal awareness to identify the sole entity, which is unchanging and indestructible; one should 
thus come to know that object apart from which there does not exist separately any other "I" (ego). This is true knowledge. The Divine Mother 
who bestows this supreme knowledge shines as the most auspicious figure and is the <EM>Jnanaambika</EM> herself. Let us pray to her always and 
be blessed with her grace.
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>In <EM>Shri Kanakadhara Stotram</EM>, on behalf of poor <EM>Brahmin</EM> lady, <EM>Shri Shankara</EM> prayed to 
<EM>Mahalakshmi</EM> as Goddess of wealth and solicited a rain of gold. In sloka 16 of this <EM>Stotram</EM>, <EM>Shri Acharya</EM>, while 
praying on his own behalf, looked upon <EM>Mahalakshmi</EM> not only as the Goddess of wealth but also as <EM>Jnaanaambika</EM>, that is, 
as one who dispels all of one’s blemishes.
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial><EM>Shri Kanchi Mahaswami</EM> has given a synopsis of <EM>Shri Adi Shankaracharya</EM>’s “<EM>Soundaryalahari</EM>.” 
In <EM>sloka</EM> No. 57 (<EM>Drisa Dragheeyasya</EM>), he prays for the Divine Mother to include him (<EM>Acharya</EM>) in her blessed glance. 
In <EM>sloka</EM> No. 84 (<EM>Shruteenam Moordhano</EM>), he prays to be blessed with her feet being placed on his head. In the former 
<EM>sloka</EM>, while asking the Divine Mother to turn her glance graciously towards him, he prays to the Goddess “to include me even 
(<EM>maamapi</EM>) in your blessed sight, O Mother!” In the latter sloka, he prays to the Divine Mother “to bless me even 
(<EM>maamapi</EM>) with your feet being placed on my head, O Mother!”
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>Here it is confirmed that the Divine Mother herself is the embodiment of <EM>Guru</EM> (teacher). According to the 
<EM>Shaastraas</EM> (scriptures), the teacher’s wooden tongs are permanently on the pupil’s head. In this way, the latter is continuously 
initiated into studies in his quest for knowledge. The crests of the <EM>Vedas</EM> (namely, the <EM>Upanishads</EM>) bear the Divine Mother’s 
feet as their (head) ornament. <EM>Upanishads</EM> have another name, viz., <EM>Shruti siras</EM> (head of the Vedas). 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>In the <EM>Kena Upanishad</EM> story, there is a reference to the moral that dispelling pride is the way to spiritual 
knowledge. Similarly, in this <EM>sloka</EM>, dispensing all pride and with extreme humility, <EM>Shri Acharya</EM> has solicited the grace of 
the Divine Mother’s feet on his head.
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>The apparent <EM>Roopas</EM> (shapes) of the Divine Mother are <EM>Lalitha, Durga, Bhuvaneswari</EM> etc. Her implicit 
<EM>Roopas</EM> are all sounds and all voices etc. In particular she is the personification of all <EM>Mantras</EM> (incantations having divine 
connotation). <EM>Shri Kanchi Mahaswami</EM> has enumerated the various names by which the Divine Mother is worshipped throughout India –

<P><FONT face=Arial>In “<EM>Sarasvatya Lakshmya</EM>”  (penultimate <EM>sloka</EM> of “<EM>Soundaryalahari</EM>”), <EM>Shri Shankaracharya</EM> 
says: 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>The devotee of the Divine Mother will be blessed with full wisdom and (its consequential) good character, great wealth 
and the sense to use it in an ethical manner, most attractive physical beauty and long life and (the implied) good health to enjoy these 
gifts. 
</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial>These ideal benefits will lead the devotee to search for inner peace. He will realize the futility of thirsting after 
wisdom, wealth, beauty of form and long life: Cured of ignorance, he will become disinterested in worldly things and, will ultimately enjoy 
release from <EM>Samsara</EM> (constantly repeating cycle of birth and death) and attain <EM>Moksha</EM> (liberation). That is the Supreme 
Bliss or the blessings of <EM>Jnaanaambika</EM>.
