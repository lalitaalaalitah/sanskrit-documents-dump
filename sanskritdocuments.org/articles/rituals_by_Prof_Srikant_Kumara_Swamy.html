<h2 align=center><b>Rituals</b></h2>

<p align=center>by Prof. Shri R. Srikanta Kumara Swamy</p>
<!--article contributed by chetana harvey chetuh@gmail.com-->

<p>Rituals have been a part of every religion, from the time of the
inception of the religion and those that exist today. But we often find
people referring to Our Hindu religion as a very "ritualistic religion",
i.e. a religion consisting of many rituals. The way they are being
conducted now, in these times has made many understand "Ritual" as
just an act done or as an act to be done with!. "It is a ritual to be
gone through" is a common refrain. It has come to mean anything done
mechanically without applying our minds to it. Is it so bad as all
that? What is a ritual after all?</p>
<p>Whenever a teacher comes to the
classroom, the students stand up. It is a ritual. Whenever the President
enters the Parliament House, all the members stand up. It is a ritual. In
our religion whenever we see our elders, we touch their feet and do
Pranam. It is also a ritual.  Are all these rituals devoid of any meaning
or significance? No. All these rituals are nothing but the manifestations
of the students" respect to the teacher, the members" respect to the
President, the youngsters" respect to the elders. In the same way,
whenever we feel grateful to someone, we say "Thank You" to him and
shake hands with him. If we feel extremely grateful, we may even
press his/her hands so much, that it will be painful to them! When
we feel happy meeting someone, we shake hands, hug and embrace . All
these acts can be called rituals manifesting our inner feelings to the
individual concerned. The same holds good even in the case of rituals
in religion. We go to temples, perambulate and prostrate before the
idol.We also undertake piligrimages, perform various havans and pujas
etc. Why does one do all those actions?If we dig deeper to find out,
one of the reasonable explanations for those actions would be that
we are only "manifesting" our feelings.we are expressing outwardly,
the   feeling of respect, love and affection towards GOD. We get Pooja
performed with flowers. Again, another way of manifesting our gratitude
or respects to HIM. We repeat his names 108 times or 1000 times. It
is a ritual manifesting our eagerness to remember HIM always with all
respect. We get Abhisheka performed. It is a ritual. Again manifesting
our respect to him by offering him all the Upacharas that we would
offer to an invited guest at home. The same meaning is there in the
poojas performed at home too. We perform a Homa. What is that? Again,
a ritual manifesting our gratitude or respect in a slightly different
way. We believe that Agni is Havyavahana (one who carries the food that
we offer to other deities) and promptly delivers the food (Havis) given
by us to the proper deity whom we are invoking.</p>
<p>Hence we can
conclude that any ritual performed is nothing but the manifestation
of our inner feelings. That is why Sri Sri Swamiji of Sringeri in
his commentary on Viveka Chudamani mentions, "Bhaktihi maanasadharmah
tadabhivyanjaka dehavyaparaha prahvibhaavaha.</p>
<p>  (Bhakthi is an
intellectual disposition, "Prahvi bhaava" is nothing but an articulation
of the body to manifest the feeling of "Prahvi bhaava" or humility
). So, it connotes that the feeling should arise first and then the
rituals follow. Imagine an individual shaking hands with us, absolutely
without any feelings, or an individual who performs Pranams without any
feelings or does worship without any feeling. We can easily discern the
mechanical nature of the ritual, devoid of the internal feeling. We simply
say he is doing it mechanically. What is the use?  Absolutely nothing,
except an exercise for the body!! </p>
<p>The question may arise, "what
is the use of a ritual at all.? Isn.t it is enough if one has only the
feelings? No. Man.s nature compels him to find an outlet for his emotions
by doing various "actions. . We find satisfaction in doing something
under its influence. That is Ritual. </p>
<p>There may be rituals or
actions which do not require any feelings to be aroused. But we know
that any action done with "Shraddha" or "faithfully., is better than one
done without any feeling of Shraddha. Teaching in a class is a ritual. It
can be done in two ways. The teacher prepares well and delivers in such
a way that all the students understand it well. This is the feeling of
Shraddha. It can be delivered just like that without proper preparation,
without bothering himself to know whether the students have understood
or not. The first way of delivering is definitely better than the second
way. A man has to give back the debt to the individual from whom he has
taken the money. This can again be done in two ways. With all reluctance,
he can just give back the money without even a murmur of thanks. It can
also be given back with a pure sense of gratitude, profusely thanking
the individual. The second way is definitely better. It is therefore
said that, the intention behind an action is much more important than
the action itself. </p>
<p>As Aldous Huxley puts it, "A well-performed
ritual is a work of art by which even a skeptical spectator will get a
kick. It will give an enduring and lingering satisfaction to both..</p>
<p>How can we get the intentions or feelings of gratitude, love and
respect aroused? It may not be difficult towards an individual who has
helped us, or one who commands respect by his character itself, or one
towards whom we have natural feeling of affection because he happens to
be our kith and kin. But, how do we get the feelings of respect, love,
gratitude aroused towards something which we can neither see or touch? Or
how can we gain that "lingering satisfaction" or the "kick" that Huxley
talks about, when a ritual is well-performed? That is where the Mantras,
the Shlokas, the Sahasranamas come in. When the Mantra extols the
greatness of that Almighty, as one who has created this wonderful world,
or who has given us this body of ours, or one who has provided us with
all the paraphernalia required for our enjoyment, etc, we naturally feel
grateful to HIM and the ritual of Pooja in different forms attains some
meaning. This can happen only when we understand what is being uttered,
be it a Mantra, a Shloka or a Nama. If we do not understand anything,
but perform the "act" only, it becomes a meaningless ritual.</p>
<p>It
is to gain that pure feeling of lingering satisfaction, a feeling bereft
of all the negative thoughts , that we MUST understand and be involved in
whatever ritual we perform.</p>
<p>A Pooja is being performed. The Purohit
says "Paadyam Samarpayami" and
asks us to offer two spoonfuls of water, by pouring that into another
vessel. What is this Ritual? "Paadyam Samarpayami "means,we are offering
water for God, to wash his feet. This concept is the same as what we offer
to an esteemed guest coming to our house. We make him sit on a chair,
and wash his feet or offer water to him to wash his feet himself. That is
.Paadyam.. When we are performing Pooja we do not have the God in human
form, but only as an idol or a photograph, or a painting or a Saligrama
or Linga. We cannot see his feet and wash. What should we do? We have to
simply imagine HIM in the human form and imagine washing HIS feet when
we offer two spoonfuls of water. The offering of two spoons into another
vessel is purely symbolic, but our feeling must be complete with the
feeling of washing of his feet.  All these are contained in the two words
</p>
<p>.Paadyam Samarpayami ..</p>
<p>By any stretch of imagination,
we cannot say that the two Sanskrit words or an appropriate Mantra or
Sloka has the power to take the two spoonfuls of water to the actual feet
of GOD. It is ridiculous!</p>
<p>(The words definitely do not mean just
offering of two spoons of water! ) In addition ,we can recite a Mantra
or Shloka in praise of the Deity and imagine washing HIS feet. The same
concept is there in all the Upacharas. We offer food as "Naivedyam.. What
is that? It is no doubt a ritual, but if done with understanding, provides
a wonderful mental satisfaction of having fed God with our choicest
foods. We offer many many things knowing fully well that God does not
consume them. It is only for OUR satisfaction that we offer. That is
why Pooja is defined as "Poojanama santosha janakaha karma samudaayaha
. . "Pooja is nothing but a bundle of rituals giving pleasure to the
performer.. </p>
<p>To day, unfortunately, even the recitation is done
by the Purohit and he does not bother whether the doer listens to them
or not and neither is the "doer" interested in knowing what is being
done. But the actions or rituals are gone through scrupulously. How can
we reconcile with such a situation? Should we believe that whatever we
do, Abhiseka, or Naivedya, etc etc, will reach the Deity? If it has to
reach the deity, then by what power or mechanism? Simply saying that
the power of the Mantra or Shloka preceeding the ritual will take the
materials to the deity is meaningless. Commonsense tells us that this
is a very far-fetched imagination and cannot be a fact. Well, we can
certainly imagine that the Naivedya has reached the Godhead. Nothing
wrong, but it can remain only as an imagination, a pious heart felt
feeling. If such a pious feeling has to be aroused in our hearts, we
must understand what we have recited. When we recite </p>
<p>"sahasra sheerShA purushaha " and perform  "Aavahana " to the deity, what is
the feeling that should be evoked? It is that, The great "Purusha .,
who is behind  all the heads, feet, eyes and hands in all the living
beings of the entire universe, and one who is  Omnipresent, and one
who transcends this universe by a large measure, is being invoked, so
that we can feel his presence in the symbols in front of us. This is
the essence of the Mantra. When we do the Avahanam to any deity with
this Mantra, we only feel that great "Purusha" is here, in the symbol
that we are worshipping. The action of offering flowers or Akshata to
the Idol, is symbolic and only to strengthen the feeling that HE is in
the Idol.  The other Mantras in the </p>
<p>"Purushasuktha" extols the
greatness of that "Purusha" and  when we do each upachaara by reciting
those Mantras, we feel as if that great "Purusha" is in front of us
symbolically and is accepting what we offer. All the actions or rituals
for the Upachaaras are just outlets for our feelings "The Mantras of
the Purushasuktha ", by any stretch of imagination,
cannot literally carry what we offer, and make them reach that "Purusha
". After all, where is HE? HE is every where. For our convenience,
for the ease of meditation and contemplation, we have many types of
symbols to which we offer the Upacharas. </p>
<p>Such a pious imaginative
feeling, can be had only when WE recite the Mantra and understand it
too. What kind of feeling will be aroused when the Purohit recites the
Mantra audibly or inaudibly and we perform only the ACT? It will be
just a futile exercise and a waste of water, or Kumkum or flowers.</p>
<p>When this is the case about Mantras,  we can imagine the fate of
Shlokas or Sahasranamas. The familiar Shloka during  "Pradakshina" is
a classic example. We say </p>
<p>.Paapoham,paapakarmaham; paapathma
paapasambhavaha ;thraahi maam kripaya deva,sharanaagata vatsala.
</p>
<p>( I have committed many sins. I am born as a sinner because
of sins committed. Oh God! The protector of people who surrender
to you, Kindly protect me). </p>
<p>It is a heartfelt feeling
of surrender. When we understand the Shloka, such a feeling is
aroused. Doing a "Pradakshina" is an action to give an outlet to that
feeling of surrender. The feeling of surrender can come only when we
understand the meaning, otherwise the tongue repeats the words, the body
rotates through 360° and falls down flat. Surrendering to HIM is a very
fine feeling, which must arise in the heart and nothing to do with the
body. Such a feeling cannot come by repeating some unintelligible words
and falling flat on the ground.</p>
<p>In the Lalitha Sahasranama, we
say "Janma-mrityu-jara tapta jana vishraanti daayini ...(you(Lalitha)
grant peace to those, who are struggling with the triple sufferings of
Birth, Death and Old age) How can this happen?  If one contemplates
on that Upanishadic Brahma, whom we are worshipping symbolically as
Lalitha, we get rid of that suffering of birth, death and old age. That
means, the name should arouse in us the feeling that SHE is the all
encompassing deity in the universe and we should immerse ourselves
in HER contemplation. Such a contemplation can bring us peace. Let us
not imagine that SHE is sitting there with a bowl of peace to offer to
us, as soon as we recite the words in the Nama!!! And offer Kunkum or
flowers.</p>
<p>There is a practice of doing Ramayana Parayana or Gita
Parayana which are supposed to be meritorious rituals. Ramayana is a
piece of wonderful literature and the Slokas are meant to understand and
enjoy. We must become one with Rama or Lakshmana or Bharata or any other
character in the Kavya. How can we expect any benefit from repeating
the words in a Shloka (Maybe sometimes incorrectly too!!) without
understanding anything?. Then, they will be as good or as bad as any other
word. For example, in the beginning itself, Valmiki is asking Narada
to name a man in this world who possesses certain qualities like</p>
<p>.Dharma,Krtagynata,satyavaakyata,dhridavratatva,satcharitra.
, etc.etc. </p>
<p>The qualities form the very foundation of
our culture. If one goes on repeating those Shlokas 100 or
even 1000 times, what we can expect to happen?  It is as good
or as bad as repeating the letters in the Sanskrit Alphabet
1000 times!!. When Rama says, with all love towards Bharata
</p>
<p>.Na sarve bhraatarastaataa bhavanti bharatopamaaha.
</p>
<p>(Not all brothers are like Bharata). Should we not be able to
join with Rama in his love for Bharata?</p>
<p>When Rama is standing
alone for the battle in "Janasthana ., in front of fourteen thousand
cruel demons, Valmiki describes the scene in a poignant manner as
an exclamation from the Devas assembled there.</p>
<p>.Chaturdasha
sahasraani rakshasaam bheemakarmanaam; Eko Ramascha dharmaatma katham
yuddham bhavishyati?.</p>
<p>(There is the dharmaatma Rama, standing alone
in front of  14000 cruel demons that are there. What kind of battle is
this? )</p>
<p>It seems when Kulashekara, the Raja of Travancore heard
this Shloka rendered by a Lecturer, he had been so immersed in the story,
that  he asked his minister to get the army ready to go to "Janasthana
" to help Rama! Kulashekara was "with. Rama at that moment and truly
experienced every moment of what Rama was up against.</p>
<p>This is
the kind of feeling aroused and should be aroused in a genuine reader of
the Ramayana. If one does not understand, how can he get that feeling at
all? What other benefit can possibly be there by repeating that Shloka
100 times in a Parayana?</p>
<p>The same holds good for Bhagavad-Gita
too.  It is full of Philosophical concepts only to be understood and
practiced in life. What kind of benefit can we expect by repeating the
Shloka only without understanding them?</p>
<p>Such a Parayana is a
meaningless ritual.</p>
<p>Let us not be under the illusion that they
are all Sanskrit words and just a repetition of those words will bring
all benefits to us. Then, why such monumental treatises like Vedas,
Ramayana, Bhagavata, Bhagavatgeetha etc?  If we go on repeating the
letters in Sanskrit Alphabet with all their "maatras ., some 1000 times
a day, by permutation and combination they are bound to become as many
Slokas in Ramayana or Geeta. </p>
<p>Parayana by itself is not wrong.
But if it has to be really useful, one should understand the full  meaning
of what one is reciting. </p>
<p>It is only then that our rituals really
become meaningful.</p>
<p>There is another aspect of the rituals which we
should consider. We have already said that they help to strengthen the
feelings aroused in an individual, feelings of gratitude, love, respect
and faith . They help the individual to concentrate better on whatever we
are trying to contemplate. For eg,let us say we would like to concentrate
on Lord Shiva, as described in the Mantras or slokas. The mind, no doubt,
tries sincerely to concentrate on the meaning of the Mantras and thereby
to contemplate on Shiva. But, what about the other senses? The eyes
will be seeing something outside, the ears will try to hear outside
sounds, the nose gets distracted by some sweet or bad smell,the hands
will not keep quiet, the knees and knee joints complain of pain, the
sultry weather in a place like Chennai makes the body feel miserable,
because of constant perspiration. Thus, all the senses try to distract
the mind away from what it is trying to contemplate. Unfortunately,
as the Upanishad puts it, that is their nature.
</p>
<p>.Paraanchi khani vyatrnat swayambhuhu; tasmaat paraak
pashyati naantaraatman.</p>
<p>(Brahma the creator, created the
senses only to look "outwards.. That is how, they never turn
"inwards").That is what we find in the Lalitha Sahasranama
also</p>
<p>. Antarmukha samaaradhya bahirmukha sudurlabha.
" (SHE is easily propitiated by those who have all their senses
pointing "inwards", but very difficult for those whose senses are
always directed "outwards"). Hence, it is very necessary for constant
contemplation(dhyana), to have all the senses to be ONE with the
mind. Even if this is not possible, we must atleast see that the senses
co-operate in the process with the mind, by making them do things that
are complementary to the feelings aroused by the mantras. That is where
the "rituals" help.</p>
<p>For eg:If one sits to perform a puja of a
shiva linga, he has an icon of Shiva in front of him.The contemplation
is to be of Shiva in the linga.The eyes will be looking at the linga
and enjoying its splendour and beauty. The ears will be listening
to the Mantras recited by the individual or others. The nose will be
busy in inhaling the sweet fragrance of the flowers made ready for the
Puja.the tongue will be busy in reciting the Mantras or stotras.The
hands will be engaged in performing Abhisheka or Puja. The body has to
sit in a particular posture convenient, but with all due respect to
the individual. Thus, all the outward senses will be engaged in acts
complementary to the act of contemplation. With this kind of co-operation
of the senses, the experience of contemplation is 100%.The same thing
holds good in performing a homa too. The eyes will be directly seeing
the resplendent Fire God,the symbol of  "Paramatma"; the ears will be
listening to he mantras;the nose inhaling the fragrance of the "homa
dhuma";the hands engaged in the act of "homa"  itself. And thus, the
pleasure of contemplating the deity will be complete.</p>
<p>A day-to-day
mundane analogy will not be out of place here. Forty or fifty years ago,
when TV wasn.t there, we used to hear the radio commentary of the cricket
matches being played in Australia or England and enjoy. But then, we could
only listen and not see. Now, that TV is beaming all the matches Live,
we can "see" the actual match with our eyes and listen to the commentary
too. Now, the pleasure is definitely doubled or even trebled. Much more
should be the pleasure of those who actually watch the match from the
pavilions. Thus, when all the outward senses are engaged in the same act
of enjoying the scene, along with the mind, the pleasure of the experience
is boundless. Exactly the same thing can be said about our rituals. It
must however be reiterated that the mere fact of the outward senses
engaged in those religious acts without the mind contemplating on the
same, will be completely futile, as no pleasure can be experienced without
the association of the mind.Again,(at the risk of tedious repetition!),
it must be said, that if the mind has to be engaged in such an act,
one MUST understand what he is reciting--be it a mantra, a shloka
or a nama. That is how , Yaska, the Rishi who wrote "nirukta.(the
meaning of the Vedas) said: </p>
<p>sthaanurayam  bhaaraharaha
kilabhuth;adheetya vedaan\,navijaanaati\,yaha artham.
</p>
<p>(He who has studied the Vedas but does not know the meaning,
is indeed, a stone pillar meant for supporting a heavy load). IF one
does not know the meaning of what one recites, the mind refuses to dwell
on the deity whose qualities, the Mantra is expected to extol. Let
us not be under the dangerous illusion that the deity to whom we
are performing the Puja will be more than satisfied by our external,
mechanical acts!!</p>
<p>One may ask the question, whether contemplation
or meditation is not possible without the external acts. Yes, it is
possible. But only when our mind is completely free from all kinds of
external forces and pressures and free from the normal maladies of humans
like greed,envy,anger,hatred,avariciousness,fear etc. We may , no doubt,
sit in a closed room, with closed eyes, sit in a particular posture,
giving no room to our external senses to grab something from outside. But
this denial is a forced one and the senses become restless. Moreover,
the mind being what it is, cannot remain concentrated on any thing
unless, there is a concrete object. It flies from place to place. Even
the repetition of a mantra may not be able to harness it because it does
not know on what to concentrate. Should it be on the letters? Should it
be on the image envisaged by the shlokas? Wthout an image or some symbol,
in front of us, the sight of which is carried by the eyes to the mind,
it is very difficult for the mind to envisage an image and concentrate
on it too. Should we concentrate on the meaning of the mantra? Yes,
it can do it- once, twice or thrice. Then the mind gets bored and
jumps elsewhere. It is here, that the rituals help the mind. They are
there to strengthen the feelings aroused in the mind and the latter
can go on thinking about it with the different rituals keeping the
mind fresh.</p>
<p> All the ritualistic processes are meant for those
simple masses who are still getting initiated into the intricacies of
spiritualism, so that it helps in contemplation of our creator and aids
us in developing a gratitude towards HIM and by contemplating more, we
one fine day can hope to rid ourselves of the "thamogunas. (the negative
qualities like greed,jealousy,anger etc etc) and cleanse our mind.</p>
<p>There definitely were and are there now, the great souls who are able
to concentrate and have achieved much without the help of rituals. Let
us pay our respects to them.</p>
