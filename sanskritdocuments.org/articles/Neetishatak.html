It is the tradition in Sanskrit poetry that whenever anyone begins writing poetry, firstly he pays his respect to God and eulogizes him. This tradition has been adhered to by Bhatrichari. 
One can only experience the beatitude of that manifestation of knowledge, of that divine energy that is indecipherable, invincible, unfathomable, but is present in all the directions, north, south, east west and is present in all the times, past present and future.

There are 3 types of people in this world- The ignorant, the experts and the idiots, the ignorant person can be taught and explained very easily. Similarly even a scholar can be explained very easy and smoothly. But not even a Pandit can explain or convince an idiot.

A selfish person does not realize his own shortcomings, such a person neither fears anyone nor does he care for any one. 
A bone which a dog eats is covered with plenty of ants is covered with saliva is dirty without flesh and is of a peculiar taste, smells foul. A dog eating such a bone does not even bother about Indra standing besides him, because a mean creature doesn’t realize the inferiority of the thing he possesses and is carefree.

A person who lacks judgement is subjected to constant advertises. 
River Ganga incarnated on earth via Lord’s Shva’s hairs, the Himalaya mountains from the mountain on earth and from the earth and from the earth into the sea. 
In this way River Ganges ended up on the lowest plane. Similarly a person who lacks judgement ends up in a plethora of difficulties.

Our desires have not yet ceased, but we have become weak and feeble and have turned useless.

Because we are involved in seeing the beauty and appreciation in our places by the banks of rivers and lakes and also the gardens and are very satisfied with all this our age and life is reducing. That is why we should abstain from material objects and on the contrary engage in contemplation of the supreme cosmic soul.

Our meals are only those things those things which are received as alms, which are tasteless and that to which are taken only once a day. There is nothing but the ground to sleep on. Our body is alike the servant. There is only one pain of clothes, which are term and are stitched at different places. 
Even after all this, sensual pleasure plagues us constantly. It is a deity that even if we are devoid of natural pleasures desires do not free us, this is indeed something despicable.

Because the mothers were not aware of wheat is burning they inadvertently fell in fire and died. In the same way a fish gets trapped in the hook on being enticed by the flesh on the hook and loses his life. But in our material world, albeit we know the cause of destruction and misery we because of our greed do not like to give up sensual pleasures which is the root cause of all our adversities. It is really ironical – the glory of ignorance is indeed unintelligible.

Despite all this, misers, destitute are ill-treated when they seek help of the wealthy and rich.

One who indulges in maternal pleasures in tormented by ailments emerging from Vata, Pitta and Kafa. Similarly there is fear of estrangement from son and misconduct in a family. There is fear of loss of wealth, fear of miserliness fear of enemies, fear of old age in youthhood. There is a fear of meaningless debate in the scriptures, there is a fear of being criticized by the bad people on aspects like merit, knowledge humility etc. the body fear death and annunciation. 
In this way every thing on earth is plagued by fear. It is only detachment that is least troubled by fear. Therefore it is in the best interest to renounce, worldly things and to become detached.

It is unfortunately nothing. Therefore we should not desire for pleasure precarious and capricious.

Realizing this engage in meditation and contemplation and attainment of super natural powers so that one can make the mind stable and calm. One should also contemplate on the supreme cosmic soul.

I did not even try to break open the door of heaven by availing to methods like Yagya etc. I did not even embrace the women in my dreams i.e. I did not even engage in Dharma and Karma out of the 4 attainments delineated. I did not think of the lotus feet of Lord Shiva, which are given of liberation. Other than earning wealth we did not attain rest of the three attainments. Moreover we our birth resulted in the emaciation of our mother’s youthfulness.

I spent most of my time alike greedy crow who is always ready to eat others food. 
I could not attain Dharma by serving any parents, could not attain Artha by earning required wealth and Kama by embracing the beautiful damsels. On the contrary we spent most of the time then by about filling our stomach without acquiring knowledge imperative for salvation.

He who nourishes his body by food given by others, who is devoid of relations and friends etc, he who lives in himself and is engaged in his work, who is detached from worldly objects, who wear clothes old and torn, thrown on the road, who is free from honour and pride, is the one whose mental flaws and short comings are eliminated and such a person gets absorbed in the bliss of Brahma on becoming Yogeshwara.

A snake can stay alive merely on air. For the cows the natural land is their bed and soft grass is their food, because of which they are happy. But god bestowed upon human beings intellect so that they find food for themselves. But the intellect seems to have got destroyed because of constant usage and search. 
The one who practice Yoga i.e. the Yogis should stay happy with whatever Lord Brahma has bestowed up on the them and that they should liberate themselves from the word by meditating upon Brahma through out life.

What is the use of all wealth and riches if the flames of self does not enkindle in the heart?

Everyone gets according to his fate.

Greed is the greatest demerit. Backbiting is the only sin. Truth is the only penance. Pure mind is the only pilgrimage. Reputation is the only ornament. Good knowledge is the only wealth. Infamy is the only death. Hence, a man must strive to give up evils and acquire merits.

It is impossible for a man to live with dignity as long as he earns his living by service. All the goodness of a servant is taken for granted as his weakness. A servant who does not raise his voice is termed as mute. A servant who speaks for his interest is termed as garrulous. A servant who hangs nearby is termed as importunate. A servant who stays away is termed as impractical. A servant who forgives is termed as coward. A servant who is intolerant is termed as impolite. Thus, the path of service is indeed very difficult, even a Yogi cannot beat this path.

Gentlemen give up their interest for the well being of the others. Some people work for the benefit of others only when their interest is hurt. Some demonic people kill the interest of others for their own selfishness. There is no word to define the people who kill the interest of others without any apparent reason.

The greatness of the great people is reflected in their behaviour that they take every kind of people in their shelter. Sea is an enormous body of water. On one hand in it rests Lord Vishnu on the other live fierce demons. On one hand, in the sea, hides Mainaak, the Mountain afraid of the Indra’s ‘Vajra’. On the other hand, the sea also stores frightening fires.

Rare are those who engage in altruism all with their mind, voice, action and body. Such great people are indeed rare in the world who devote their mind, words and actions for the charity of others; who magnify even the smallest virtue of the others and who always remain pleased.

Even the evil ones acquire virtues in the company of meritorious people. Golden Sumeru and silver Kailash have no use because the trees have not changed their virtues on them. But, Malayachal is indeed meritorious for in its company, trees like neem have become sandalwood.

People who have great patience take rest only after finishing their job. The gods did not feel satisfied with the jewels they got from the sea, nor did the fear the deadly poison that emerged from the sea. They continue to churn the sea until they got the ambrosia. Similarly, intelligent people do not stop without achieving their goal.

On the way to achieve his goal, a man of action sometimes speaks on the earth and at other times sleeps on cozy bed. Sometimes he eats herbs; at others, he relishes delicious food. Sometimes he wears rags; at others, he enjoys silken clothes. Still, a man of action does not care for his miseries.

Fate is the only reason for the rise and fall. A snake, which is desperate of life, gets a new lease of life when a mouse cuts open a way into its basket. The snake eats away the mouse and escapes through the same hole.

A man must not give up his patience even in abject misery. A tree, cut to the ground, crops up again. The moon, waned in darker phase, regains its round shape in the brighter phase. Considering this, a man of patience does not feel sorry even in abject misery.

Enterprise strengthens the fate. Even the king of gods, Indra lost the battle to the demons though he had a mentor like Devguru Brihaspati, had a weapon like Vajra, had gods as soldiers, had a castle in the heaven, had Vishnu as his aid and had Airavat, the elephant as his vehicle. It all shows that the fate is supreme and futile enterprise has no use.

Anything must be done after proper consideration only. Though sorrow and happiness are the fruits of previous actions and the intelligence is also mended by the actions. Still, a man must thoroughly consider anything before doing it.

A bald person, seeking shelter to protect his head from the scorching sun, reaches under a coconut tree. But there, a large coconut fell on his head. Similarly, misfortune follows an unfortunate person wherever he goes.

It is not a fault of spring if not a single leaf appears on the tree of Kareel. It is not a fault of the sun if an owl can not see in the day. It is not the fault of the clouds if not a single drop of water falls in the beak of Papiha. Whatever Brahma has written as fate for someone, no one can change it.

Karma is indeed great. Anybody can obtain the thing of his desire through Karma. We worship the gods but they too are bound to the fate. Should we worship the fate then? That too gives as per the Karma. Hence, we salute the Karma. Even the God does not go against the Karma.

It is the Karma, which employed even Brahma in the creation of the universe like a potter. It is the karma, which forced Vishnu to take the pain of arriving in incarnations. It is because of karma that Lord Shiva roams here and there begging with a bowl in hand. And it is the karma, which forced the sun to take a round in the sky daily. We therefore salute the karma.

Moral principles are the true benefactors of a living being. Company of the meritorious people is the only benefit. Company of fools is the only sorrow. Wastage of time is the only loss. Love for the religion is the only efficiency. Controlling the sense organs is the only victory. A woman who acts as per the wishes of her husband is the only beloved person. Knowledge is the only wealth. Staying in the home country is the only comfort. And obedience to the dictates is the only rule.
