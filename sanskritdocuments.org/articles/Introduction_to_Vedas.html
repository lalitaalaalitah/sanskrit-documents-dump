<b><center>5. Vedas</center></b>
<P>In the Rig Veda, the universal truths propounded explain the universal order
of life in three planes
<P>* Internal ( to the Soul )
* External ( to the body in terms of Dharma or worldly life )
* Spiritual ( in terms of the cosmos )
The universal order of life in these three planes is then linked to the
Supreme encompassing the three planes. Thus all terms / names mentioned such
as Indra, Agni, Vayu etc. have exoteric and esoteric significance in each of
the three planes as understood by the individual Soul depending on the
spiritual evolution of the Soul
@
<P>The Sama Veda consists of hymns (many of them common with the Rig Veda)
which when sung in the appropriate manner will strike a chord in enabling
one to understand the universal truths and order of life depending on their
stage of spiritual evolution. The source of the musical patterns of the Sama
Veda hymns is derived from the vibra tion / sounds of the cosmos. This
reveals that spiritual evolution can be achieved through music (by hearing
as well as singing).
@
<P>The Yajur Veda consists of hymns from the Rig Veda along with other hymns
which when recited in the performance of a yajna / havan will enable the
Soul or the beneficiaries to understand the universal truths of the Veda in
any or all of the three planes of its meanings depending on the individual's
stage of spiritual evolution. Though the Yajur Veda is associated with
performance of Yajna for worldly gains, it is understood that the individual
beneficiaries will ultimately evolve spiritually and subsequently undertake
these Yajnas for the spiritual and material benefits of mankind as a whole.
The Yajur Veda has two distinct schools of presentation and following as
explained below.
@
<P>This Veda is followed in the Northern parts of India and has mantras in the
form of the Veda and Brahmanas (explanatory notes to the mantras) presented
in the Satapatha Brahmana. The Shukla Yajur Veda is said to have been taught
by the "Sun" to sage Yajnavalkya and hence the name "Shukla" or "White"
Yajur Veda.
@
<P>This is followed in the Southern parts of India and has Veda mantras and
Brahmanas intermixed - that is, the Brahmanas follow the mantras as
explanatory notes in the Veda text itself. Since Shukla Yajur Veda is known
as "White", this Yajur Veda has been denoted as "Krishna" or "Black" Yajur
Veda. Both the versions are accepted as authentic and both schools are
practised widely.
@
<P>The Atharva Veda, when understood in the external plane, is generally known
to contain hymns common to the Rig Veda including others for the sole
purpose of performing "Magic" or to communicate with ghosts and spirits or
for curing ailments. However, when viewed in the spiritual plane, the
Atharva Veda expounds universal truths of the oneness of the universe, the
way to live in communion with the world of evolved souls, to pray for a
healthy life and finally to merge with the Supreme.
@
<P>All the Vedas provide the same knowledge to experience the Supreme through
different paths.
@
The Rig Vedi would approach this goal through prayer and intellectual
pursuits.
The Sama Vedi through musical renderings of the hymns
The Yajur Vedi through Yajna and invocation of Agni to carry the message of
th e hymns to the Supreme.
The Atharva Vedi through tantra or other rituals.

The Vedas propound and accept all forms of religious practice in the pursuit
of understanding and merging with the Supreme. Hence it is highly secularand
tolerant in its teachings by ultimately preaching.
<P>"May Happiness and Peace come to One and All irrespective of Faith, Creed,
Colour and Social order of the Society including Beings of other forms of
evolution."
