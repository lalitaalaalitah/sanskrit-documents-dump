<b><center>7. Brahmacharya (Celibacy)</center></b>
<P>The importance of "Brahmacharya" is clearly explained in Yejurveda. In this
modern life very few only understand this and practice it. All Vedas and
other scriptures of Hinduism lay great emphasis regarding Brahmacharya. In
vedic period a student is also known as Brahmachari. By preserving the
energy, strength and vitality of mind and various organs one can lead a
happy, energetic and healthy li fe. The mind will be clear and brain will
superb for a Brahmachari. It enhances the strength, life span and health
since it is the mine of all virtues .Brahmacharya is the dam of all
pleasures of life and only learned people keep it and their power and life
increases and all sickness is destroyed. It is easy to preach and to
practice is very difficult. One should try to be always in the company of
noble people and control their senses as far as possible to get the actual
reward of human life. A man is known by the company he keeps. If one always
move in the company of good, learned and noble ones there is no doubt that
he can be one among them one day. Company is contagious and man changes his
colors accordingly sooner or later. He cannot remain unaffected for long
best company means not only noble people but also good books written by
great scholars, Sages, Saints, Prophets, Rishis, and  Munis. These contain
vast treasures of wealth and wi ll make one so rich that the worldly riches
would appear very insignificant. One of the verses in YajurVeda state that
taught people who are actually endowed with divine powers should do two
things in this world. One is that they should propagate the teachings of
Brahmacharya and control of senses so that people may become strong and
healthy leading a full vigorous life. Next thing is by education and
practice thereof, they should teach one and all how to develop their inner
strength and power so that people may enjoy their blissful life fully in all
respects. In another verse it is stated that such people who abandon the
company of bad people and give up all bad evil habits and keep away from
immoral life increasing their vitality beget good children, they strength
and  glorify their race and their country.
<P>Brahmacharya will give the power to face and solve any problems as a boat
can ferry people through turbulent waters of the sea. A Brahmachari will be
liked and respected in all the societies and meetings. In one verse it is
explained that the age of a boy begins at twenty-sixth year and for a girl
it is seventeen and up to this period they should practice Brahmacharya at
any cost and can get married. Those who get education following the rules of
Brahmacharya, they shine like sun are quick in all what they do, like a hawk
and become the hallmark of respect, enjoying their life skipping like a
deer.
<P>In the student life it would be better to preserve their vital fluid which
is the life thread, so that they can utilize their energy and strength for
their education and learning. In vedic period student is imparted with all
the knowledge right from the Earth to the sun and in this way all divinity
reside in his body and such students in future will assets to their country
and world. They will have harmony of the head, heart and hand in such a way
which will be beneficial to the society as a whole. It has been truly said
that if our hearts are strong, our heads are right in vain. A person without
education is beast and a person without Dharma is like a beast.
<P>Education and knowledge are like two eyes of a person which enable him to
see things correctly and assess his own position. The purpose of education
is to make man what he ought to be.
<P>According to Vedas education on arts and material science is not enough and
because major portion of achieving perfection can be achieved by studying
spiritual science. The aim of life and education is that we may live a new
life in the realm of self and the creation, with harmony and happiness and
will become virtuous. Every second of the life should be fully utilized so
that there is no room left for idling. It may be noted that "An idle mind is
a devil's workshop." Of course relaxation and enjoyment should be there
along with study to kee p one fit and fresh and ready to face any challenges
of life.
<P>If proper education is not given to children parents become enemies since
they get isolated in society. Teachers should take utmost care for
understanding to develop good character and affection along with studies.
They should be taught that all women are like mother, sister or daughter
according to their age and they should be protected whenever necessary.
<P>In Vedas it is also stated that
<P>Not to earn wealth at the cost of others pain and suffering
It is not good to be fatigue self too much both physically and mentally.
Hard-work is the keystone to virtuous earning with the sweat of one's own
brow, not by lottery, speculation and gambling.
Don't do anything undesirable and harmful to the society
Acquire knowledge which can't be stolen away by thieves than material
wealth.
A great scholar of ancient India Sri Pathanjali's in his  teachings
explains the impor tance of Brahmacharya and it is studied by foreign
scholars and one such famous scholar
Dr. Louis an eminent physician opined that most precious atoms of the blood
enter into the composition of semen (in his book Chastity) . So preservation
of semen by  practicing continence helps the better development of brain ,
body, and mind .Dr. Nicholas says that the best blood in the body goes to
form the elements of reproduction in both the sexes .So if anybody waste
semen he is loosing the best part of the blood and he becomes weak
physically and intellegently. If preserved he becomes strong,
intellectual, heroic and powerful.
<P>Brahmacharya can be practiced by married people also. Chastity and fidelity
are the foundation on which a strong and happy marital relationship stands
and should be understood by husband and wife. In Srimad Bhagavatham a holy
book of Hinduism it is clearly mentioned that practice of brahmacharya is
also on e of the important duties in married life and it is waived only for
the purpose of procreation, austerity, purity, contentment and friendliness
towards all. (11.18.43)
Ancient Rishi of India Pathanjali  also says in his Yogasutra
that CONTNENCE IS LIFE AND INCOTINENCE IS EQUAL TO DEATH.
LORD SHIVA in the  Jnanasamkalani Tantra says that " The wise do not regard
the ordinary forms of asceticism as real asceticism. Continence is the highest
asceticism. He who is a continent is equal to God.
So especially youth in whom the future of our country rests, should practice
celibacy as far as possible to lead the country and countrymen to have a
prosperous future.
