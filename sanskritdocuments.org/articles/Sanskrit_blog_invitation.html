Dear Sanskrit Lovers,

We seek your contributions to the Learn Sanskrit blog at:
https://learnsanskrit.wordpress.com/

We would like you to contribute, a little something, on a regular basis. 
Your frequent blog can be a sentence around a dhaatu or a sloka or a noun or 
anything which helps us learn Sanskrit.

At this wordpress blog site, we are currently mirroring entries 
from another Learn Sanskrit site:
http://www.ee.adfa.edu.au/staff/hrp/personal/sanskrit/index.html 
(please follow the Sentences link).

Thus far the intention behind putting this material has been to help us 
learn Sanskrit and secondly to give a feeling of togetherness, to other 
Sanskrit lovers, in learning Sanskrit. If you can post to educate others, 
please do so. Your contributions will be highly valued.

You will need a wordpress userid to edit the Learn Sanskrit blog.
 
Getting a wordpress userid (and blog) is simple. Suppose you want 
"Mysanskrit" as your blog identity. In your web browser Address box type:
 http://Mysanskrit.wordpress.com. If the userid you specify does not 
exist, you will automatically be directed to a signup page. If there 
is already a blog with that name then please try another userid.
 
Once you have a wordpress userid, please send us a mail, so that we 
can invite you as a contributor to learnsanskrit.wordpress.com

There are many methods to add Devanagari text. Two of the simplest are: (a) 
download and install Itranslator2003, write using Itranslator and then 
copy-and-paste, and (b) use Aksharamala and directly key into wordpress 
blog. Some details about using Devanagari are given at:

Thanks.
