<CENTER>Ancient Hindu civilisation and mathematics</CENTER>
<CENTER>By Dr R.N. Das</CENTER>

<P>The ancient Hindu sages discovered the miracles of modern scientific
tools. Believe it or not, the following are the glorious examples of
them.

<P>I. The Concept of Zero

<P>The concept of zero came from the revered Hindu sages in Vedic times
thousands of years ago.

<P>Without the concept of zero the binary system is blind. No counting,
no commerce or no computer business. The earliest documented "date"
was found in today's Gujarat [BC 585-586] in an inscription on
Sankedia copper plate. In Brahamaphuta.Siddhanta of Brahamagupta
(7th century CE), zero was lucidly explained. Muslim invaders from
Central Asia crossing the Hindukush mountain ranges invaded Bharat
1300 years ago and plundered its beauty, riches, books, thrones and
what not. They plagued the holy land with sword, loot, arson and
rape and destroyed and ravaged the whole land in the name of jehad
and "Allah". There was no Steven Spielberg (Schindler's List) like
cinema director who could document this sordid past of our history.
There was no patent system at that time. Might was right. They
considered those substances of robbery maal-e-ganimat (booty looted
from kafirs to be distributed among themselves and friends of
theirs) and thus inculcated those invaluable theorems of
mathematics, astronomy and geometry in Arabic books in around 770-
1200 CE. From there, those extraordinary concepts were carried to
Spanish Europe in the 8th century. However the concept of zero was
referred to as shunya in the early Sanskrit texts of the 4th century
BC and was clearly explained in Pingala's Chand Sutra of the 2nd
century too.

<P>II. The Contribution to Astronomy

<P>Hindu sages told modern scientists how to map the sky in terms of
glaring stars almost 4000 years ago. Copernicus published his theory
of revolution of the Earth around the Sun in 1543 AD only. But our
Aryabhatta in the 5th century had stated that the Earth revolves
around the Sun in these specific words: "Just as a person boarding
on a boat feels that the trees on the banks are moving, people on
the revolving earth also feel that the sun is moving". Such
illustrious teaching of astronomy was rarely seen in the
contemporary writings of the Greek astronomers. In his Aryabhatteem,
he clearly stated that our Earth was round and it rotated on its own
axis, orbited the Sun and was suspended in the space. It also
explained that the lunar and solar eclipses occurred by the
interplay of the shadows of the Sun, the Moon and the Earth.

<P>III. The Law of Gravity

<P>The Law of Gravity was known to the ancient Hindu astronomer
Bhaskaracharya. In his Surya Siddhanta he noted: "Objects fall on
the Earth due to force of attraction of the Earth. Therefore, the
Earth, planets, constellations, the Moon, and the Sun are all held
in the galaxy due to this great cosmic attraction."

<P>It was in 1687.1200 years later.that Sir Isaac Newton discovered (re-
discovered?) the Law of Gravity, which was already invented by the
greatest Hindu astronomer Bhaskaracharya, of course which was
written in the holiest language, Sanskrit.

<P>IV. The Invention of Trikonmiti

<P>The word geometry seems to have emerged from the Sanskrit word
gyaamiti, which means measuring the Earth. And the word trigonometry
is similar to trikonmiti meaning measuring triangular forms.

<P>Euclid was famous for the invention of geometry in 300 BC whilst the
concept of trikonmiti had emerged in 1000 BC in Bharat. It is
evident lucidly from today's "practice of making fire alters (at
homagni kshetra) in different shapes, e.g., round, triangular,
hexagonal, pentagonal, square and rectangular". It was part and
parcel of daily pujas and homagnis in ancient times. The treatise of
Surya Siddhanta (4th century) described in fascinating details about
trigonometry, which was introduced in Europe by Briggs 1200 years
later in the 16th century.

<P>V. The Invention of Infinity

<P>The value of "Pi" was first invented by the ancient sages of Bharat.
The ratio of circumference and diameter of a circle is known as "Pi"
which gives its value as 3.14592657932...

<P>The old Sanskrit text Baudhayna Sulbha Sutra of the 6th century BC
mentioned that above-mentioned ratio as approximately equalled to
that of Aryabhatta's ratio [in 499 BC] worked out the value of "Pi"
to the fourth decimal place as [3x (177/1250) = 3.1416]. Many
centuries later, in 825 AD, Arab mathematician, Mohammed Ibn Musa
admitted: "This value of "Pi" was given by the Hindus (62832/20,000
= 3.1416)."

<P>VI. Baudhayna's Sulbha Sutra versus Pythagoras's Theorem

<P>The famous Pythagoras's theorem states: "The square of the
hypotenuse angled triangle equals to the sum of the two sides." This
theorem was actually discovered by Euclid in 300 BC but Greek
writers attributed this to Pythagoras. But the irony of fate is that
our so-called intellectuals (indeed Macaulay's sons who have
forgotten their old but rich and glorious ancient Hindu heritage)
had also accepted that theorem as a contribution of Pythagoras. They
never read or tried to know that Baudhayna's Sulbha Sutra which has
been existing for many thousands of years (written in the Sanskrit)
had already described lucidly the theorem as follows: "The area
produced by the diagonal of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the
area produced by it on two sides."

<P>VII. The Measurement of Time or Time Scale

<P>In Surya Siddhanta, Bhaskaracharya calculated the time taken by the
Earth to revolve around the Sun up to the 9th decimal place.
According to Bhaskaracharya's calculation it is 365.258756484 days.

<P>Modern scientist accepted a value of the same time as 365.2596 days.

<P>The difference between the two observations made by ancient Hindu
sage Bhaskaracharya just by using his super brain (in the 4th
century AD) and today's NASA (National Aeronautic and Space Agency)
scientists of America by using super computer (in the 20th century
AD) is only 0.00085, i.e., 0.0002 per cent of difference.

<P>The ancient Bharatbhoomi had given the world the idea of the
smallest and largest measuring units of Time. In modern time, only
Stephen Hockings, Cambridge University Professor of theoretical
physics, had the courage to venture into the abysmal depth of the
eternity of Time. Astonishingly, our ancient sages taught us the
following units of time:

<P>Krati =34,000th of a second
Truti =300th of a second
2 Truti =1 Luv
2 Luv = 1 Kshana
30 Kshana =1 Vipal
60 Vipal = 1 Pal
60 Pal = 1 Ghadi (=24 Minutes)
2.5 Ghadi = 1 Hora (=1 Hour)
24 Hora = 1 Divas (1 Day)
7 Divas = 1 Saptah (1 Week)
4 Saptah = 1 Maas (1 Month)
2 Maas = 1 Ritu (1 Season)
6 Ritu = 1 Varsha (1 Year)
100 Varsha = 1 Satabda (1 Century)
10 Shatabda = 1 Saharabda
432 Saharabda = 1Yug(Kali Yuga))
2 Yuga = 1 Dwapar Yuga
3 Yuga = 1 Treta Yuga
4 Yuga = Kruta Yuga
10 Yuga = 1 Maha Yuga (4,320,000)
1000 Maha Yuga = 1 Kalpa
1 Kalpa = 4.32 Billion Years.
Therefore, the lowest was 34,000th of a second known as krati and
the highest of the measurement of the Time was known as kalpa, which
equalled to 4.32 billion years. Is it not amazing? Are you not
feeling proud to be a Hindu descendent? Swami Vivekananda, the
modern sage of Bharat, stated in his famous sermons compiled in his
Rousing Call to the Hindu Nation, "Take pride in Hinduism; pronounce
yourselves as a descendant of a Hindu. Boast to be a Hindu and give
a clarion call to rouse the Hindu nation from its lethargy and
slumber."

<P>VIII. The Invention of Decimal System

<P>It was the ancient Bharatbhoomi that gave us the ingenious methods
of expressing all the numbers by means of 10 symbols (decimal
systems).an invaluable and gorgeous idea that escaped the genius of
Archimedes and Apollonius, two of the greatest Greek philosophers
and mathematician produced by antiquity (100-130BC).

<P>The highest prefix used for raising 10 to the power in today's
mathematics is "D" for 1030 (for Greek Deca).While as early as 100
BC Hindu mathematicians had exact names for figures up to 1053.
<PRE>
a. Ekam = 1
b. Dashkam = 10 (101)
c. 1 Shatam = 100 (102)
d. 10 Shatam = 1 Shahashram = 1000 (103)
e. 10 Dash Shahashram = 10,000 (104)
f. Laksha = 100,000 (105)
g. Dash Laksha = 10,00,000 (106)
h. Kotihi = 10, 00, 0000 (107)
i. Ayutam = 100,000,000 (109)
j. Niyutam = 100,000,000,000 (1011)
k. Kankaram = 10,000,000,000,000 (1013)
l. Vivaram = 10,000,000,000,000,000 (1016)
m. Pararadahaa = 1017
n. Nivahata = 1019
o. Utsangaha = 1021
p. Bahulam = 1023
q. Naagbaalaha = 1025
r. Titlambam = 1027
s. Vyavasthaanapragnaptihi = 1029
t. Hetuhellam = 1031
u. Karahuhu = 1033
v. Hetvindreeyam = 1035
w. Sampaata Lambhaha = 1037
x. Gananaagatihi = 1039
y. Niravadyam = 1041
z. Mudraabalam = 1043
aa. Saraabalam = 1045
ab. Vishamagnagatihi = 1047
ac. Sarvagnaha = 1049
ad. Vibhutangaama = 1051
ae. Tallakshanaam = 1053
</PRE>

<P>Is it not amazing to know that the ancient Hindu sages used to
remember them just by using their outstanding memory power or was
there some super computer known to them also, which we are quite
unaware of?

<P>In Anuyogadwar Sutra, written 100 BC, one numeral had been shown to
be raised to as high as 10140 which is beyond our outmost stretches
of imagination. All of our remaining hidden treasures, which had not
been destroyed or stolen by the foreign mercenaries and invaders,
were written in Sanskrit, mother of all languages, which should be
revived. It is our legacy to inherit such rich property that our
forefather had left for us by their meticulous observations over
thousands of years ago.

<P>All hidden treasures are written in Sanskrit, which we are quite
ignorant of and our so-called Macaulay's sons are trying their best
to prevent us from knowing about our glorious past. Sir Monier-
Williams rightly said: "Hindus are perhaps the only nation, except
the Greeks, who have investigated independently and in true
scientific manner, the general laws that govern the evolution of
languages."

<P>There was no patent system at that time. Might was right. They
considered those substances of robbery maal-e-ganimat (booty looted
from kafirs to be distributed among themselves and friends of
theirs) and thus inculcated those invaluable theorems of
mathematics, astronomy and geometry in Arabic books in around 770-
1200 CE.

<P>More than this, the Hindus had made considerable advances in
astronomy, algebra, arithmetics, botany and medicine, not to mention
their superiority in grammar, long before some of these sciences
were cultivated by the most ancient nations of Europe.

<P>Indeed, Hindus were Spinozists 2000 years before the birth of
Spinoza, Darwinians many centuries before the birth of Darwin, and
evolutionists, centuries before the doctrine of evolution had been
accepted by Aldus Huxley's of our times, and before any word like
evolution existed in any language in this world.

<P>We should take a vow to work together to search those hidden
treasures out, propagate the notion that Sanskrit is not a dead
language. Sanskrit is the elite of the elitist, classic of the
classics and it should be revived once again. We will again sit in
the seat of the world assembly with our head held high and with
pride. I would like to draw the final touch with the quotation from
Swami Vivekananda, "I do not see into the future nor do I care to
see. But one vision I see clear as life before me, that the ancient
Mother has awakened once more sitting on her throne rejuvenated,
more glorious than ever. Proclaim her to all the world with the
voice of peace and benediction."
