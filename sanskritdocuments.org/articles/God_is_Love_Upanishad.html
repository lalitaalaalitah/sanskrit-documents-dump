    GOD  IS LOVE  UPANISHAD
 

           

         .GOD IS LOVE.  everyone knows, because well known writers, 
teachers philosophers and poets have explained in a nice way, 
but what is really natural knowledge nature has given to us that 
I  want to keep in front of you as a mirror.

Please watch carefully as following picture shown to you.:-

 

                          [ 1 ] GOD                                       GOD [ 4 ]

 

                                                      IS [ 5 ]

                      

                      [ 2 ] LOVE                                       LOVE [ 3 ]

 

 You will read as follow:-

 

[a]   1,5,2  as GOD  IS LOVE.

 

[b]  2,5,3  as LOVE IS LOVE.

 

[c] 3,5,4  as LOVE IS GOD.

 

[d] 4,5,1 as GOD IS GOD.

 

[e] 1,5,3 or 4,5,2 as             GOD IS LOVE.

 

[f] 5  as IS  (WHICH IS CENTER OF GOD AND LOVE.)

 

      Each word of .GOD IS LOVE. has its separate meaning or formula as follow:-

 
G = GO                         I = IS                           L = LIFE**       
O = OVER                   S = SOUL*                  O = OF

D = DEATH                                                     V = VERY                    

                                                                         E = ESSENCE

 

*S = SELF +                   **L =LOVE                + S = SEE

 O = OF                              I = IS                          E = ETERNAL

 U = UNIVERSAL            F = FULL                  L = LIGHT

 L = LIGHT                      E = ESTABLISH       F = FULLY
