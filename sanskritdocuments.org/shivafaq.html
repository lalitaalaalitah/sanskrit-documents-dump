The Dictionary meanings of "Shiva" are as follows:(Monier-Williams):
Meaning  mf(%{A4})n. (according to Un2. i , 153 , fr. 1. %{zI} , `" in
whom
all things lie "' ; perhaps connected with %{zvi} cf. %{zavas} ,
%{zizvi})
auspicious , propitious , gracious , favourable , benign , kind ,
benevolent
, friendly , dear (%{a4m} ind. kindly , tenderly) RV. &c. &c. ; happy ,
fortunate BhP. ; m. happiness , welfare (cf. n.) R. v , 56 , 36 ;
liberation
, final emancipation L. ; `" The Auspicious one "'N. of the
disintegrating
or destroying and reproducing deity (who constitutes the third god of
the
Hindu1 Trimu1rti or Triad , the other two being Brahma1 `" the creator
"'
and Vishn2u `" the preserver "' ; in the Veda the only N. of the
destroying
deity wss Rudra `" the terrible god "' , but in later times it became
usual
to give that god the euphemistic N. S3iva `" the auspicious "' [just as
the
Furies were called $ `" the gracious ones "'] , and to assign him the
office
of creation and reproduction as well as dissolution ; in fact the
preferential worship of S3iva as developed in the Pura1n2as and Epic
poems
led to his being identified with the Supreme Being by his exclusive
worshippers [called S3aivas] ; in his character of destroyer he is
sometimes
called Ka1la `" black "' , and is then also identified with Time "' ,
although his active destroying function is then oftener assigned to his
wife
under her name Ka1li1 , whose formidable character makes her a general
object of propitiation by sacrifices ; as presiding over reproduction
consequent on destruction S3iva's symbol is the Lin3ga [q.v.] or Phallus
,
under which form he is worshipped all over India at the present day ;
again
one of his representations is as Ardha-na1ri1 , `" half-female "' , the
other half being male to symbolize the unity of the generative principle
[RTL. 85] ; he has three eyes , one of which is in his forehead , and
which
are thought to denote his view of the three divisions of time , past ,
present , and future , while a moon's crescent , above the central eye ,
marks the measure of time by months , a serpent round his neck the
measure
by years , and a second necklace of skulls with other serpents about his
person , the perpetual revolution of ages , and the successive
extinction
and generation of the races of mankind: his hair is thickly matted
together
, and gathered above his forehead into a coil ; on the top of it he
bears
the Ganges , the rush of which in its descent from heaven he intercepted
by
his head that the earth might not be crushed by the weight of the
falling
stream ; his throat is dark-blue from the stain of the deadly poison
which
would have destroyed the world had it not been swallowed by him on its
production at the churning of the ocean by the gods for the nectar of
immortality ; he holds a %{tri-zUla} , or three-pronged trident [also
called
Pina1ka] in his hand to denote , as some think , his combination of the
three attributes of Creator , Destroyer , and Regenerator ; he also
carries
a kind of drum , shaped like an hour-glass , called D2amaru: his
attendants
or servants are called Pramatha [qq.vv.] ; they are regarded as demons
or
supernatural beings of different kinds , and form various hosts or
troops
called Gan2as ; his wife Durga1 [otherwise called Ka1li1 , Pa1rvati1 ,
Uma1
, Gauri1 , Bhava1n2i1 &c.] is the chief object of worship with the
S3a1ktas
and Ta1ntrikas , and in this connection he is fond of dancing [see
%{tANDava}] and wine-drinking [1074,2] ; he is also worshipped as a
great
ascetic and is said to have scorched the god of love (Ka1ma-deva) to
ashes
by a glance from his central eye , that deity having attempted to
inflame
him with passion for Pa1rvati1 whilst he was engaged in severe penance ;
in
the exercise of his function of Universal Destroyer he is fabled to have
burnt up the Universe and all the gods , including Brahma1 and Vishn2u ,
by
a similar scorching glance , and to have rubbed the resulting ashes upon
his
body , whence the use of ashes in his worship , while the use of the
Rudra7ksha berries originated , it is said , from the legend that S3iva
, on
his way to destroy the three cities , called Tri-pura , let fall some
of rage which became converted into these beads: his residence or heaven
is
Kaila1sa , one of the loftiest northern peaks of the Hima7laya ; he has
strictly no incarnations like those of Vishn2u , though Vi1ra-bhadra and
the
eight Bhairavas and Khan2d2o-ba1 &c. [RTL. 266] are sometimes regarded
as
forms of him ; he is especially worshipped at Benares and has even more
names than Vishn2u , one thousand and eight being specified in the 69th
chapter of the S3iva-Pura1n2a and in the 17th chapter of the
Anus3a1sana-parvan of the Maha-bha1rata , some of the most common being
Maha1-deva , S3ambhu , S3am2kara , I1s3a , I1s3vara , Mahe7s3vara , Hara

<P>
Q@<B>I am not able to understand your second question about "transcribing it
in picture words into English". Do you mean how to write the word in
sanskrit script?</B>@Q

<P>
<!A:>This is a follow-up question to the previous one about Shiva.
The Supreme God is only ONE, called Brahman; the human mind, being limited,
gives IT different names and forms(Siva, Vishnu, etc.), to facilitate
worship, meditation, contemplation, etc.

<P>
Yahweh, Allah come closest to the concept of Brahman. Jesus would be
compared to the Avatar, the Suprme Spirit(Brahman) taking a human form
to teach humanity the potential to be divine.

<P>
The archaeological evidence presently goes back to about 7000B.C
(Harappa-Mohenjodaro) for the worship of Siva. It seems logical that the
development of this worship must have existed many millenia or centuries
before that.

<P>
It would seem that the boundaries of the land where the language(s)
arose were not as restrictive as the present political ones!
However, the present Indian sub-continent seems to have spent the
maximum effort in preserving those traditions and use of the language, namely
Sanskrit.

<P>
The prehistoric Siva is a column of light, illuminating the universe,
stretching to infinity and existing eternally, and seen in mystic
contemplation/meditation. The concrete form of worship is as rounded
cylinder situated in the center of a cavity, representing the creative
or generative energy of the former. In Sanskrit, Linga refers to
'representation', as well as gender. The esoteric symbolism is beyond
the grasp of most unprepared human minds. So paganistic interpretations of
'fertility cult' etc. abound in non-mystical texts.

<P>
The humanisation of the abstract Siva perhaps began around 3000 B.C.,
and the epic and mythical literature from then until about 1000 A.D.
consolidated the practice of Saivism.

I hope this information is useful to you. The internet now has a voluminous
collection of documents related to any subject, and links could number
in the thousands. Any search engine would give you a reasonable overview of
