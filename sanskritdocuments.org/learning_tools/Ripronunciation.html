<P>Speaking about Panini's phonetics, there is a question to examine:<BR>
What is the correct pronunciation of the word 
Sanskrt....Sanskr'i't (as pronounced in UP etc) or Sanskr'u't (as 
pronounced in Maharashtra and Gujarat?....I submit that 
/mru.....mriyate/ seems to suggest that there are separate sounds 
and hence the different graphic symbols for /mru/ and /mri/ in the 
orthodox Devnagari script...because there are separate 
pronunciations for the vowels /hru/ and /i/...(and perhaps the 
difference in pronunciation is meant to be phonemic!); that is, the 
two sounds could have been used to convey distinctive meanings.

<P>I notice that even Hrigveda is written as Rigveda.../hri/ is a 
vowel, while /r/ is a consonant..In Devnagari the word is written 
as the one corresponding to Hrigveda...a vowel, and not a 
consonant, in the 'word initial' position.

Subject: [Sanskrit] pronunciation of the vowel R^i<br>

<P>Note: "R^i" is just the ITRANS internet standard for
the special symbol in Indian script. It does not mean
that the pronunciation is "ri". In the Harvard-Kyoto
standard, the same symbol is written as "R" - but I am
not used to writing in the Harvard-Kyoto scheme.

<P>Message:
None of the current pronunciations of the vowel R^i in
modern Indian languages correspond to the
pronunciation in sa.nskR^ita.

<P>The pronunciations are all correct WHILE SPEAKING IN
THE MODERN LANGUAGES, because each of these languages
(Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Telugu, etc) have
their own independent rich grammar and literature and
sound standardization.

<P>In Western UP Hindi -> ra<BR>
In "standard" Hindi -> ri<BR>
In Marathi, Gujarati -> ru<BR>
In Tamil, Malayalam -> ri<BR>

<P>Clearly, in all of these modern languages, these are
two joined sounds, not one: (1) the consonant
(vya.njana) "r" + a vowel "a"/"i"/"u"

<P>The sound R^i is a vowel. Vowels can be sounded
continuously for a long time without changing their
sound-character.

e.g.<BR>
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<BR>
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<BR>
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<BR>
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<BR>
ooooooooooooooooooo<BR>
similarly it is possible to say<BR>
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR<BR>
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL<BR>

<P>The toungue-placement (sthaana) for R^i is the
muurdhan (the highest part of the hard palate, the
same part where the tongue is placed for T, Th, D, Dh,
N. Also for the second "shh", but only a certain
literate speaking tradition in Marathi make a
distinctly different tongue placement for "sh" and
"shh". I don't know about Gujarati. Most modern
Indians do not pronounce "shh" as it was pronounced in
sa.nskR^ita. This is quite OK while speaking their own
modern language.)

<P>The mouth effort ("prayatna") for R^i is "vivR^ita" on
the inside, and "vivaara" on the outside. This means
that the inner part of the throat is open, and there
is a continuous flow of air from the throat through
the mouth out of the lips. So when the tip of the
tongue touches the muurdhan, it should not block the
flow of air at any time. If it blocks the flow of air,
this turns into the consonant (vya.njana) "r".

<P>Of course, "ra", "ri", "ru" all break the continuous
flow of air from the throat to the mouth as the tongue
touches the palate to make the "r" sound, and then
they all change from muurdhan to kaNTha (for "ra"), or
taalu (for "ri"), or oshhTha (for "ru"). Which are all
wrong while speaking in sa.nskR^ita. (But correct in
those modern languages.)

<P>Similarly for the vowel L^i, the tongue placement for
which is near the teeth ("danta"), and the flow of air
is unbroken.

<P>R^i as a true vowel is used in modern mandarin chinese<BR>
L^i as a true vowel is used in modern standard English<BR>
(but not most Indian accented English)<BR>
For example the the word "simple"<BR>
This is correctly pronounced:<BR>
'sim-pl (the final "l" being a vowel)<BR>
Sometimes in Indian accented English, we say 'sim-pal<BR>
or 'sim-pel, in which case "l" is a consonant.<BR>

<P>Shreyas-ji you should take your mri-yate argument
further to see that that none of "ra", "ri" or "ru"
are the same as R^i - all have separate symbols<BR>
1. (mother-worship) maatR^i + archanaa
= maatrarchanaa = maat"ra"rchanaa -> "ra" not equal to
"R^i"<BR>
2. (mather's wish) maatR^i + ichchhaa
= maatrichchhaa = maat"ri"chchhaa -> "ri" not equal to
"R^i"<BR>
3. (mother's service) maatR^i + upaasanaa
= maatrupaasanaa -> "ru" not equal to "R^i"<BR>

<P>However, do be careful. It is not a good idea to base
your phonetics/pronunciation on script writing. There
are 18 varieties of "i" in sa.nskR^ita, (similar
number in maraThi) but mostly for convenience we use
only two symbols "i" and "ii", which are taught to us
at school. This is perfectly fine, because most
readers who know the language choose the correct
variety of the the vowel based on the context.<BR>
