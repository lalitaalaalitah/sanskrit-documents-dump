COMMENTS:- There are many hymns in praise of Lord Ganesha. He is
to be worshipped at all times and in particular at the start of
any new venture to ensure its success. But the worship of the Lord
need not be limited only to warding off obstacles in our life. He is
indeed the Supreme Being waiting to bless us with all we want. One
of His names (No.298) that appears in the popular Vishnu sahasranama
stotram isकामप्रदः meaning He grants in plenty the desires of
His devotees.भक्तेभ्यः कामान् प्रकर्षेण ददातीति कामप्रदः ।
This means that one may ask Him for anything that is `proper' - that
is not against the mandates of the shahstras and be sure it will be
granted. In Gita (7-11) He mentions that He indeed is behind all such
`proper' desires.धर्माविरुद्धो भूतेषु कामोऽस्मि भरतर्षभ ।
So, we may seek any thing that is `proper' from Him. This includes even
mokSha. But true devotees seek only devotion to Him.  The best example
of this kind of unalloyed devotion is the prayer by Kulashekara in his
Mukundamala. Please read this moving prayer.
    नास्था धर्मे न वसुनिचये नैव कामोपभोगे
         यद्यद्भव्यं भवतु भगवन् पूर्वकर्मानुरूपम् ।
    एतत्प्रार्थ्यं मम बहुमतं जन्मजन्मान्तरेऽपि
         त्वत्पादाम्भोरुहयुगगता निश्चला भक्तिरस्तु ॥
Our sages have categorised all the desires the humans can
possibly have into four types. They are called as goals of life or
पुरुषार्थाः. They are called dharma, artha, kama and finally
mokSha. The first three pertain to the life here. Dharma means performing
the duties as ordained by the shastras. The result will be punyam or
merit. This will yield better quality of life here and even life in
higher worlds. Artha means material possessions and includes money,
houses, family and friends. Properly earned and used these should
yield happiness. Kama means enjoyment resulting from the previous goal
artha. MokSha means liberation from the cycle of births and deaths. In
the above poem Kulashekara says that he is not interested in the first
three goals as said above. He says let anything happen as ordained by
fate or according to the past karma. What he wants from the Lord is only
unwavering devotion to His lotus feet. Then it becomes His responsibility
to take care of the devotee's wants. He had given this assurance in Gita
(9-22).
     अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते ।
     तेषां नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ॥
However, most of us are not so mature as Kulashekara and are troubled
with day-to-day problems. So we pray to Him and seek His help. There is
nothing wrong in this. Krishna classifies devotees into four types. The
first one is the one who is troubled. (Gita - 7-16). Can anyone claim
to be free from troubles? God helps such people also. In fact He terms
these people as good ones (सुकृतिनः) since they have turned to
Him on some pretext.
     चतुर्विधा भजन्ते मां जनाः सुकृतिनोऽर्जुन ।
     आर्तो जिज्ञासुरर्थार्थी ज्ञानी च भरर्षभ ॥
This particular hymns is one such and prays to Him for relief from
(ऋणम्) debt. Debt means money etc., owed to some one. But the
word debt has another meaning. It may be surprising or even shocking
to know that according to our shastras everyone is born a debtor with
three debts. This said as follows:-
     जायमनो वै ब्राह्मणो त्रिभिरृणवान् जायते, ब्रह्मचर्येण
     ऋषिभ्यः, यज्ञेन देवेभ्यः, प्रजया पितृभ्यः ।
                          Taittariya samhita (VI.3.10)
One is a debtor to rishis, devas and pitrus or the manes.
These debts can be cleared by brahmacharyam - celebacy, yagna -
sacrifices and praja - progeny. So it is said that :-एष वानृणः
यः पुत्री यज्वा ब्रह्मचारिवासी । Kalidasa says in his Raghuvamsa (8-30)
that the king Aja freed himself from these debts as said here.
     ऋषिदेवगणस्वधाभुजां श्रुतयागप्रसवैः स पार्थिवः ।
     अनृणत्वमुपेयिवान्बभौ परिधेर्मुक्त इवोष्णदीधितिः ॥
It is to be noted that these debts will pursue us as long as we continue
to take births. And the cycle of birth and death is said to be indeed
endless. CF. Gita (2-27)जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युर्ध्रुवं जन्म
मृतस्य च । This sounds highly discouraging. Does this mean that
we are caught in an endless cycle? Fortunately the answer is `no'.
The Lord also says later on (8-15) that once a person manages to reach
Him the person is freed from this sinister cycle of births and deaths.
     मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दुःखालयमशाश्वतम् ।
     नाप्नुवन्ति महात्मानः संसिद्धिं परमां गताः ॥
The method to reach Him has been given in detail in Gita and other
scriptures.  By intense devotion to God one purges his mind of all
bad tendencies lurking in the mind. Once the mind is thus made pure God
provides a suitable guru who will guide him further in the spiritual path
towards liberation. Thus we should worship Lord Ganesha with devotion
and He will take care of our spiritual progress by giving us all we need
including the spiritual wisdom.  He had vouchsafed in Gita (10-10).
     तेषां सततयुक्तानां भजतां प्रीतिपूर्वकम् ।
     ददामि बुद्धियोगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते ॥
He is omniscient God and is worshipped by all sages and wise men.
The following vedic prayer says this.
     ॐ गणानां त्वा गणपति ँ हवामहे कविं कवीनामुपमश्रवस्तमम् ।
     ज्येष्ठराजं ब्रह्मणां ब्रह्मणस्पत आ नः श‍ृण्वन्नूतिभिस्सीद सादनम् ॥

          ॐ श्री महगणपतये नमः ।
The above mantra salutes Lord Ganapathi and describes Him as the chief
of the hosts of the gods. He is the omniscient and behind the wise. He
is of infinite glory and lord of the vedas, The hymn given in the
beginning tells that Ganesha was worshipped by Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva,
Devi, Kumara, Vishvamitra the sage etc. This shows that Ganesha who is
talked about herein is verily the Supreme Being. So by being devoted
to Him we can rest assured that He will take care of all our needs,
both secular and spiritual.

The last verse (No.10) is theफलश्रुति gives the benefit
of reciting the verses.  It says that one who recites the verses
with sincerity for one year will become as rich as Kubera the god
of wealth. It may be difficult to believe this statement. But the
great acharya Shri Vedanta Desika, when he was invited to the court
of a ruler to be the poet there, said that he will never seek the
patronage of the rich or kings who rule over a small piece of land
for few years; but would prefer to serve the Lord. He cites the story
of Kuchela who was too poor to offer any present to Krishna who was
the king of Dwaraka. He carried a small quantity of hand pounded rice
with him and offered it to Krishna. Krishna accepted it with great
pleasure and relished it.  In return for this meagre offering He
made Kuchela as rich as Kubera.  Please read the verse given below.
    क्षोणीकोणशतांश पालन कलादुर्वारगर्वानल-
         क्षुभ्यत्क्षुद्रनरेन्द्र चाटुरचनान् धन्यान् न मन्यामहे ।
    देवं सेवितुमेव निश्चिनुमहे योऽसौ दयालुः पुरा
         धानामुष्टिमुचे कुचेलमुनये दत्ते स्म वित्तेशताम् ॥
Krishna says this clearly in Gita (7-23). He says that those who
worship Him get unlimited benefit while those who seek to worship
others get benefits that are short lived. This is because of
the fact that those whom we approach for some benefit themselves
suffer from many limitations including limited lives. So people who
seek favours from others and not from the Lord cannot be called as
intelligent because the effort involved in the worship is the same
in both cases.
    अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भवत्यल्पमेधसाम् ।
    देवान् देवयजो यान्ति मद्भक्ता यान्ति मामपि ॥
So we should worship Him the Supreme Being who is here depicted
as Ganesha.
