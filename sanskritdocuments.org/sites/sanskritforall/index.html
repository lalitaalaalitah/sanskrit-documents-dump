This site is about my country, India, mostly. And for initiating a renaissance, however inconsequential it may prove to be. In my view the most potent and effective method is to propogate the Samskrit language and to induce and encourage ordinary Indians to use that language in their daily lives. 

<p>
I am aware that my efforts will, at the most, provoke amused contempt in our "secular" India. I am not aware of the slightest trace of heroism - permit me this euphemism for foolhardiness, if you please - in myself in trying to swim against the current.

<p>
I wish to show - or, at least, convince myself - that Samskrit is still the most flexible language even in modern times. (I am conscious of the delicious irony of making that assertion in the English language!) So, this site will contain material about science and technology, gathered mostly from the Internet and translated into Samskrit.

<p>
This is an individual effort and may be full of errors and shortcomings and I would appeal to visitors - who might have unwittingly (for who would rush in where angels fear to tread?!) stumbled into this site - to be indulgent.
