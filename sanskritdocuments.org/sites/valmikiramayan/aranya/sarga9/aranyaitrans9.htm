<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Seetha foresees danger in Rama&#39;s decision to eliminate the demons in Dandaka forest, without 
			any provocation from their side, at the request of some sages. She narrates an old episode 
			about a sage who in possession of a weapon became violent and cruel.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. sutiikSNena abhi anuj~naatam</em> = by Suteekshna, well permitted; <em>prasthitam bhartaaram raghu

<p class="tat">
To Rama, the scion of Raghu and her husband, who started out when permitted by Sage Suteekshna, Vaidehi 
spoke this with friendly words. [3-9-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
Seetha addresses Rama with this percept. &quot;Wielding weaponry you are entering into an area where the 
demons are dense, and you intolerantly embark to kill them, thereupon we two get separated, which in 
turn is intolerable to you. So let us leave weapons back at hermitage and go to forests to see sages 
- Govindaraja. &quot;The promise made to sages in eradicating demons is <em>himsaatmaka</em>, injurious; 
they can be won over by <em>ahimsa</em>, non-injurious methods also. None can avert Rama to make a promise, 
nor ask him to deviate from it. Aware of this stubbornness of Rama, her heart felt a foreboding, and 
that love-blind Seetha started telling in a friendlily manner, in view of her friendship with Rama, 
that may disrupt soon.</p>

&quot;Gross unjust will accrue to any in an abstruse way if his indulgence is enkindled merely by his own

<p class="comment">
For the first word <em>adharma</em> of Gorakhpur version, there are other words available in other mms 
like <em>yastu dharmam tu</em> and <em>ayam dharma</em> . The critical editions and also Dharmaakuutam 
puts it as <em>ayam dharmaH susuuksmeNa vidhinaa praapyate mahaan...</em> Instead of <em>adharma, ayam 
dharma</em> is there, which changes the negative attitude to positive Then this <em>ayam dharmaH</em> 
translates as &#39;this dharma, the duty of a prince, which you are going to take-up in the wake of promise 
given to sages, i.e., killing demons, without a valid reason, that which is righteous to you, can be 
performed in a different way...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
This last compound of second foot where <em>nisH shreyasam hitam</em> is available in Gorakhpur version. 
In Eastern version it is <em>bhaven niHshreyasam hi tat</em> and in other older scripts it is:

manaH| sarvataH cintayantyaa me tava niHshreyasam nR^ipa||</em> Dharmaakuutam puts this wording as:
<em>niHshreyasam mahat.</em> It is similar in critical editions also <em>bhaven niHshreyasa.n hitam</em> 
Dharmaakuutam defines this expression as, <em>anena bhartR^iu 
hitakaariNyaa bhaaryayaa shreyo bhavatiiti suucitam||</em> In any way, Seetha&#39;s contemplation is, 
&quot;you abide by your oath given to sages, and thus kill the demons. But without a cause you do not proceed 
to eliminate. If a cause for quarrel is to be there, that will be due to me. If I become the cause and 
depart you, you cannot survive without me, for you are not a polygamist. So how all these factors like 
your promise, monogamy, and eliminating demons, can be resolved by you? Thus I am thinking along with 
the associated troubles which you are going to undergo...&quot;</p>

<p class="comment">
There are some conflicting reviews on this stanza. It is said in the first foot <em>vaneSu niyata aatmaanaam</em> 
But older mms contain <em>sva dharmeSu nirata aatmaanaam</em> will be found, while Dharmaakuutam and 
Eastern versions have it as <em>vaneSu nirata</em> only. This Gorakhpur version and critical editions 
are having as <em>vaneSu niyata</em> The meaning in other versions is that Kshatriya-s should delight 
in their class-oriented righteousness, even when in forests. Thus Seetha&#39;s thinking is that they should 
live like hermits in forests, without resorting to the warring attributes of Kshatriya class. In the 
second foot she says that the function of bow is limited to &#39;safeguard the suffering lot...&#39; In the 
next chapter at 3-10-3, Rama retorts with the same expression in answering Seetha.</p>

Sheetha&#39;s dilemma</p>


<p class="tat">
This particular chapter is an interesting juncture in Ramayana, 
where Seetha reminds about the question of triggering cause for Rama&#39;s waging a war against demons. 
Seetha&#39;s doubt is well explained in Dharmaakuutam, the encyclopaedic commentary on Ramayana. A number 
of pages are allotted there for this chapter, and it is said there, that if Seetha is said to be self-contradictory 
in telling Rama that bow and arrows are a must to Kshatriya-s to protect the helpless when saying &#39;safeguard 
the sufferers, then only Kshatriya-s should use their bow...&quot; as at verse 3-9-26 above, and also questioning 
immediately at 3-9-27, &#39;where the Kshatriya dharma, where the hermit&#39;s way of living...&#39; etc., dharmaakuutam 
says not so. She is not contradicting herself in her statements, but asking Rama to have a cause, without 
resorting to weaponry against those demons, in a straightforward way.
<em>ataH tad rakShaNaaya aayudhamna graahyam iti etad 
abhipraayakatvaat ||</em></p>

<p class="tat">
She is inquisitive to know 
why Rama alone shall raise the bow and arrows against some demons hurting some sages. These sages are 
having super powers and Indra like celestial chiefs are coming to these sages to take them to heaven 
with their mortal bodies. Can&#39;t they eliminate these demons? But these super hermits are not going to 
heaven, which is the minimum ambition of any penance, but requesting Rama to protect them from demons. 
And Rama obligingly started to wage this unilateral war, where any war requires a triggering point. 
Can&#39;t the super sages eliminate these demons, with their powers acquired by their penances? This is 
the question of Seetha. For this, Rama replies so convincingly in the next chapter, saying that the 
sages cannot issue forth a curse at the demons, in the course of their penance.</p>

<p class="tat">Sage Vishvamitra, though 
being a furious sage, once sought the help of Rama to counter the Demoness Tataka. And Rama rendered 
it. Now also these sages do not waste their powers at the mischievous demons, but ask Rama to safeguard 
their interests, for Rama is the king, whether he may be in capital or in forests.</p>

<p class="tat">Secondly, Rama is subjected 
to the throne of Ayodhya, now being held by his brother Bharata, and as a loyalist to that throne, Ram 
should act in accordance with the rules of his kingdom. This area Dandaka forests is under the ambit 
of their own kingdom. So Rama has to perform the deeds suitable to their kingdom. When killing Vali, 
Rama speaks to Vali -- &quot;all this area is under our kingdom, now held by Bharata, and it is my duty 
to act in accordance with the decree of that throne...&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Regarding the cause, Seetha&#39;s 
doubt comes true and she alone becomes the ultimate cause for Rama, to wage the final war with Ravana.</p>
