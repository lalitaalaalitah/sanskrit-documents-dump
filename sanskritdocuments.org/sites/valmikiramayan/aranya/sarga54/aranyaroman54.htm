Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Seetha drops her ornaments at Sugreeva and other monkeys available on a mountaintop during the course of her abduction. Ravana does
not take notice of this as he is hurrying as though haunted by Rama. On crossing the southerly ocean, his jitteriness in stealing Seetha ceases and
he hypocritically feels elated in gaining both Seetha and an animosity with Rama.</p>

<p class="tat">
That broad-eyed and curvaceous lady with resentment Seetha, inwrapping her auspicious ornaments in the upper-fringe of her sari,
dropped in the midmost of those five Vanara-s with a thinking that 'these creatures may perhaps indicate them to Rama.' [3-54-2, 3a]</p>
<p class="comment">Some say that Seetha shore her upper cloth and bundled the ornaments while some others say that whole of the upper cloth was
dropped. The Indian <font color="#B3003A">sari</font> worn by those women of yore was in a different fashion, where they wore <font color=
"#B3003A">sari</font> like the present day <font color="#B3003A">dhoti</font> with pleated back stuffing like men, but they also used an upper cloth
enough to cover their busts. A three-piece dress is a must, either to man or a woman in Indian style. It comprises of a loincloth dhoti or sari, and
a shirt-like or a jacket-like bust cover, and an upper-cloth to hang on the shoulder to men or to muffle the bust for women. So some say the whole of
upper cloth of Seetha is dropped bundled with ornaments.</p>

On his part that Decahedron Ravana has not noticed her action in whipping up her silky upper-cloth and ornaments, their bundling and
stowing away at five vanara-s, owing to his own hurry. [3-54-3]</p>
<p class="comment">Ravana is in his own hurry because Rama may have heard the wailing of Seetha and thus may be chasing him, or will chase his
shortly. He bothers like this until he crosses the ocean and enters his city-state Lanka. There he is absolutely secured. Until such time his 'mousy
thievishness' haunts him. But Seetha is on his flank and under his arm, her trunk turned against his. Then she shortly saw the oddish Vanara-s, who
look unlike ordinary monkeys, but with some presumably pro-human and non-demonic features, yet monkeyish with some regality, and then she quickly
plucked off her ornaments and upcast her upper-cloth, and hastily but carefully, bundled her jewellery and downcast that bundle at them.</p>
<p class="comment">These ornaments are said to be one nosering, one earring, one bracelet, one biceps-let, one anklet with tinkling bells - all from
her right side - because showing ornaments/items worn on left-side to husband is held improper. The anklet that has fallen from her leg on earth, in
earlier chapters, is from her left leg.</p>

Those ochreish-eyed best Vanara-s with their unwinking eyes have observed the broad-eyed Seetha, who at that time is verily wailing.
[3-54-4b, 5a]</p>
<p class="comment">The 'wink-less-ness' is the property of celestials, thus the vanara-s saw with wink-less eyes with their wide-eyed amazement. Here
the Vanara-s are said to be bulishly impetuous beings and if so, could they not have averted or countered Ravana - will be the question. It is a
regular scene for them to see this skywalker demon to carry off such goddess like ladies and they have seen many women thus carried off. But this
particular one is appearing to be somewhat different, more over she is repeatedly calling for some 'Rama...' and she is wriggling in that demon's
capture. They know this demon to be Ravana and they even know of the alliance of Ravana with Vali. If these handfuls of vanara-s dare Ravana, they
die at the hands of Ravana instead at the hand of Vali. Hence, they remained silent spectators to save themselves. This is why Sugreeva did not
indicate the way Seetha in which was abducted by 'some' demon, to Rama, in Kishkindha, when they firstly met.</p>

this Dandaka or Janasthaana are his frontiers for operation but not the areas of his stronghold. And when once these areas are crossed reaching
Pampa, there is no more self-confessed fear.</p>

Ravana placed down Seetha whose eyelashes are blackish and who is deep in bewilderment caused by whimpering, therein his palace
chambers, as demon Maya had once kept al his demonic scriptures duly usurping them from his own mentor, namely Shukracaarya, at an unknown illusory
place. [3-54-13b, 14a]</p>
<p class="comment">This verse has some divergences from the viewpoints of commentators.
Govindaraja's text uses <em>maayaam iva striyam</em> while Tilaka uses <em>mayaH maayaam iva
aasuriim</em> thereby the word 'aasurriim...' suggests that Ravana brought a <em>maayaa siita</em>
'an illusory Seetha...' instead of original Seetha, which original Seetha is said to have been in
safe keeping of Ritual-fire until the elimination of Ravana, and comes out of the same Ritual-fire
after the elimination of Ravana. A very big controversy surrounds this statement and whole of the
auxiliary Ramayana-s are brought in, along with <em>puraaNa-s,</em> which substantiate this
riddler, <em>maayaa siita.</em></p>
<p class="comment">As it is, we do not find that much debatable aspect in Valmiki Ramayana, if the
statement that 'Ravana placed Seetha in an unapproachable Black Hole like Lanka, as Maya once
placed Hema in an unapproachable underground Black Hole...' is taken up. This episode of demon
Maya-Hema occurs in Kishkindha, Ch. 51, which may please be referred. Then it suffices to satisfy
the verbiage of <em>aasuriim</em>, when the analogy of 1] Lanka of Ravana and <em>R^iksha
bila,</em> 'Black Hole' of Maya, both being the constructions of artifice, and again between 2]
Maya, the demon and Ravana, the demon, [that too, the eliminable demons,] 3] nymphet Hema and
nymphal Seetha, [the causative factors for elimination,] and the actual eliminators Indra and Rama,
is taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="comment">The eyes of Seetha are said to be blackish at their ends. This is not mascara or something like a makeup article. The eyelashes
are longish like those of celestials, so as to give a blackish orb around her eyeball and because she is now ceaselessly shedding tears, these
eyelashes are tear-wet and slanted edge-ward to give a blackish shade at the end of her eyes.</p>

<p class="comment">
The wording in this verse <em>mohaat mudiataH sa raakshasaH</em> together with the word <em>hR^iSTaH 
raavaNaH</em> at verse 6, is discussed by commentators stating that he is self-conceitedly and hypocritically 
lost in his own hallucinations of possessing Seetha. Tilaka commentary says that bringing Seetha to 
Lanka is a villainous act but not with an iota of reverence to her, when elucidating verse 1 of next 
chapter where it contains: <em>aatmaanam buddhi vaiklbyaat kR^ita kR^ityam amanyata...</em> &#39;he believed 
in his own self that he achieved a great feat, as his brain gone astray foolishly...&#39; But the poet also 
says proximately that he is amused in gaining an <em>archenemy&#39;s animosity,</em> i.e. that of Rama. 
It is therefore said that he is happy as his release from his accursed demon-hood is set to happen soon, 
as he achieved the abduction of Seetha, thus paved way for Rama to come to Lanka to release him from 
his accursed being. This is supported by the statement in verse that Ravana&#39;s words have some <em>mahaa 
artham</em> &#39;words with allusion, or secret message&#39; to Rama perhaps, as at verse 29.</p>

<p class="comment">
If Lanka is a body, it embodies pleasure seeking traits seated in <em>manas</em> &#39;pleasuring heart...&#39; 
along with an &#39;ever witnessing soul...&#39; called <em>saakshi buuta aatma</em>. Along with the release 
of captivated soul, called Seetha, this pleasure seeking <em>manas</em> &#39;heart&#39; also gets released. 
And the releaser or the deliverer is Rama, and hence Ravana is happy.</p>
