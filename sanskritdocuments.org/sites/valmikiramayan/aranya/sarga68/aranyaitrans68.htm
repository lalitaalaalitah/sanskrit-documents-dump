<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 68<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Jataayu names Ravana as the abductor of Seetha while breathing his last. Though he struggles hard to 
say what all has happened, the Time called death takes him away, at such a time when the important information 
is about to be said to Rama. Receiving that much information at least, Rama consigns Jataayu to funeral 
fire, like his own relative and performs other rites, and then proceeds for searching Seetha.</p>

The cuscus grass is the aromatic fibrous root of an Indian grass, Vetiveria zizanaoides, used for making 
fans, screens, etc., Urdu kaskas. This odd combination of trees of gold, instead of wood, and grass 
instead of leaves, is an omen of death.</p>

<p class="comment">
Information about Ravana is given here in the first stanza of the verse, in a half-way-through manner. 
And the character of Jataayu itself is evanished by a jump cut of the couplet, only to be filled by 
his brother Sampaati in the later parts of Kishkindha Kanda. In between these two stanzas of one verse, 
where one brother says one stanza, the other by another, the episodes of Kishkindha come to take part. 
The second foot just contains the name of Lanka where Ravana dwells. But it is not said here for dramatic 
effect and for the flow of epic through its own course. Further, Jataayu is not &#39;dead&#39; but he released 
his lives. And he is safeguarding his lives so far, only to tell Rama. For this Skanda Puraana says 
that Seetha blesses Jataayu to live until Rama comes to him, and listens form Jataayu. But she did not 
stipulate as to how much Rama has to listen or how much Jataayu has to report.
<em>devii 
maa~N praahaH raajendra yaavat sambhaaShaNam mama | bhavataH taavat aasan me praaNaa iti aaha jaanakii

<em>yaj~naaH shiilam sadvR^ittam yeSaam te</em> and the worlds <em>yaa gatiH gamyata iti gatiH - lokaH</em>. 
And this is different to that of practising ascesis amid Five-Fires. <em>ahita agne, ahitaaH paristhaapitaaH 
agnayaH yaH pancaagnayoH yasya saH...</em> &#39;But animals or birds have no faculty to perform those rituals 
and they have their own course of lifecycle after their demise. Then where is the question of a bird 
going to heaven, which heaven is scheduled to some specialists...&#39; is the objection. But Jataayu acquired 
all those &#39;merits&#39; when he combated without any retreat <em>a paraa vartinaam</em> and he is getting 
a short cut without undergoing too many other kinds of births, and he is given <em>mukti</em> &#39;emancipation&#39; 
from lifecycles, for his action on behalf of a godlike Rama is justifiable and befitting to get a final 
release, by word of Rama <em>by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to...</em> where He alone 
can transcend the manmade rules.</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;Then the cremation, that too ritualistic one, is unavailable for birds and animals, how then can Rama 
perform funerals for birds, or get them performed for monkeys, as in the case of Vali...&#39; For this it 
is said, &#39;that&#39;s why Rama had to cremate Jataayu and further said <em>by me cremated ritually and by 
me aptly consented to...</em> as sort of special sanction of <em>mukti</em>, because the animality has 
no authority in scriptures or its rites. Taking some action, endeavouring to protect <em>dharma,</em> 
or obstructing <em>a dharma</em>, itself is superior to mere reverencing a god, or performing a daily 
rot of <em>yaj~na, yaaga-s,</em>, etc., which in itself is a subjective performance. Here Jataayu did 
not attack Ravana keeping Rama or Seetha in view, but attacked Ravana only to play his part in stalling
<em>a dharma</em>, which is not that easy, like purchasing some temple tickets to perform some ritual, 
for and on behalf of ticket holders and their families.</p>

<p class="comment">
&nbsp;For this it is said in <em>nR^simha puraaNa</em> 
says that <em>mat kR^ite 
nidhan yasmaat tvayaa praaptaa tam dvijottama | tasmaat mama prasaadena viShNu lokam avaapyasi ||</em> 
&#39;because of me you attained your demise, thereby you get the realms of Vishnu...&#39; where &#39;because of 
me&#39; is to be taken not as an individual godhood, but as <em>dharma</em>, &#39;because of dharma...&#39; itself. 
Hence the special sanctions to Jataayu, where such sanctions are absent in the case of Vali, as he followed 
the course of <em>a dharma</em> and there are many scripts that say Rama gave this emancipation to Jataayu, 
in chorus <em>uvaaca

&#39;Has this Rama got no other work than weeping for his beloved ones and patiently performing obsequies 
to all lowborn, lowly subjects like dead monkey, birds, or even each individual demonic soldiers... 
they are all shuudra-s&#39; is haunted feeling to some. For this it is said
<em>na shuudraa 
bhagavat bhaktaa vipraa bhaagavataa smR^itaa | te shuudraa ye hi a bhaktaa janaardane ||</em> &#39;one who 
is devotee of Vishnu cannot be called a <em>shuudra...</em> he is to be called <em>vipra, Bhaagavata...</em> 
but a non-devotee, may he be in any caste, he is a shuudra...&#39; And <em>shuudra</em> is <em>upa lakshaNa</em> 
to birds or animals, thereby even animals and birds are on an even footing, if it comes to paying deference 
to god, and god alone is capable to decree emancipation to every or any being. &#39;Again it is said that 
Rama is god, but yet he weeps... is it not self-contradictory...&#39; Not so, when a neighbour weeps for 
the hardships of his neighbour, won&#39;t the neighbourly god weep...&#39; that too on incarnating as a human...
<em>vyasaneShu 
manuShyaaNaam bhR^isham bhavati duHkhitaH</em> &#39;when humans are in difficulties, He wails much...&#39; 
but waits much also, till those humans can correct or come over their problems on their own, keeping 
a little faith on Him...&#39; Here also, the sobbing of Rama is comparatively nothing when compared to the 
sobbing for Seetha, because the action of Jataayu is not that sob-ful, in encountering <em>a dharma...</em> 
thus Valmiki is aware of &#39;good&#39; sobbing and &#39;bad&#39; sobbing in this sob-stuff, called Ramayana. </p>

<p class="comment">
Rama chants two Vedic passages <em>yaamya suukta, naaraayaNa suukta - aapastamba sutra-s</em>&nbsp; as they are usually 
recited by Brahmans in such funeral rites. Here it is &#39;so imperfectly conducted, because it is for an 
ineligible bird, that too by an unrelated highborn Kshatriya Rama, reciting unconcerned Vedic hymns...&#39; 
is the objection. Jataayu is beyond any caste or creed by way his devotion to duty and by his self-sacrifice 
while on duty. Hence, he is beyond eligibility or opposite of it. Funerals are to be conducted by one&#39;s 
own sons or nearest relatives. If none of the relatives of the dead is present to cremate, they are 
to be undertaken by the king of that kingdom. When Rama blessed the soul of Jataayu to go to highest 
realms, which are far beyond the Veda-s of mortals, it is a sacrosanct act to chant those hymns... on 
human level; hence, Rama&#39;s action is clearly pro-Vedic. And in Vaishnavaite tenets everything culminates 
into one - Vishnu. &#39;the adherents of Vishnu, may it be an animal, like Gajendra, the elephant, or humans, 
like Shabari et al., or a bird, like Jataayu, by Him, by Vishnu alone, they are led to the Ultimate 
course of the realm of Vishnu...&#39;</p>
