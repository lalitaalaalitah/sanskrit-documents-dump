<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 67<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama spots Jataayu, whose wings are hacked and who is breathless, and is in his last moments. On conceding to the suggestion of
Lakshmana that they should search for Seetha, they start searching the forest and at certain place the mountainous Jataayu is seen. Mistaking him to
be a demon Rama wants to kill and speedily approaches Jataayu, but on listening Jataayu's words, Rama recognises and laments for his wretched
situation.</p>

<p class="comment"></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Comment: 'Here is Valmiki's blatant attempt to add too many words for
one Seetha...' so some may say them as: <font color="#B3003A">'Stock epithets for Sita are only three in Ayodhya kaanda, but increase in Aranya
kaanda and later, all relating to her being Janaka's daughter and belonging to Mithila and Videha...'</font> in some book called <font color=
"#B3003A">' Epic Threads ' -- John Brockington on the Sanskrit Epics, by Greg Bailey &amp; Mary Brockington, 366 pages, paperback, New Delhi: Oxford
Univ. Press 2000; Reviewed by Pradip Bhattacharya.</font> But we are told by tradition that these are neither stock epithets nor metre fillers, but
each has its own significance. Here the word 'Seetha' is for the recollected wife Seetha, and 'Vaidehi' is for the reminisced Videha king. In the
same numbered sarga of Bala Kanda 67, and even in Bala 66, Janaka harps on that 'Seetha is a valour's bounty... Seetha is a valour's bounty...' And
as a son-in-law, if Rama were to face Janaka later, should he be shamefaced in not protecting Seetha... or shall Rama simply tell Janaka that 'a
demon took away or ate away your daughter...' If he says so, what happens to his innumerable epithets - will be the collateral question. This is what
Rama said "Oh, kind Lakshmana, this Godavari is talking to me anything but a reply, and on coming across Vaidehi's father Janaka, also thus Vaidehi's
mother-in-law and my mother Kausalya, really what is that unpleasant word that I have to say to them, in the absence of Vaidehi...' at 3-64-11, 12a.
Again, these are often-repeated epithets of Seetha by Rama after the abduction of Seetha.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Seetha is given to Rama presuming Rama to be a true valiant and
befitting husband and the saviour of Seetha, as Rama established his superpower in breaking a non-liftable bow, in any dire situation. But reversed
are situations in Aranya as she is likely to be abducted in its early chapters, and really abducted in later chapters. Now Rama has actually not
protected Seetha, though capable enough. Leave Rama and Valmiki alone for a while in giving so many epithets to Seetha, can any self-respecting
son-in-law, a protective husband, more so, a semi-super power on earth, can possibly face his father-in-law and say smilingly, 'your daughter is
lost...' Hence, these <font color="#B3003A">'so many epithets... that too, as Vaidehi, in particular, in this particular Aranya...'</font> have their
own meanings and subtexts, which can be known only through commentaries, unlike reading a novel. Ramayana is a <font color="#B3003A">dhvani
kaavya</font> ' epic with allusions...' and which word has which allusiveness is to be known first, before theorising the craft of Valmiki or the
crafty interpolators. 'If the interpolators have interpolated unwittingly, will the Sanskrit grammarians and linguists keep quiet, or wage a war,
until it is changed...' is the pursuant exclamation. Hence we appeal to the near extinct species called Sanskrit pundits to record somewhere as which
epithet functions in which way.</font></p>

<p class="comment">Rama's weeping is real or unreal, is a haunted notion for commentators. Here also he is weeping over. For this Maheshvara Tiirtha
says that he weeps and bewails when his adherents are ill at ease. In Ayodhya <font face="Translit 98" size="3em" color="#B3003A"><span style=
"letter-spacing: 1.5pt; line-height : 115%; margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%"><b>vyasaneShu manuShyaaNaa~N bhR^isha~N bhavati duHkhitaH || utsaveShu
ca sarveShu piteva parituShyati | 2-2-40</b></span></font> 'Rama feels very sad towards afflictions of men, and feels delighted in all functions
celebrated by people on the occasions of child birth and the like, just as their own father does...' So, it must be true in respect of Seetha, even.
This is agreeable to Govindaraja, too.</p>

<p class="comment">Here the words ekaayane kR^irChre may mean differently. kR^iChre 'difficultly...' ekaayane 'one-way breathing, breathing in,
inhaling difficultly...' and this way of juxtaposing words, 'Jataayu is struggling for a breath...' would mean more near to the scene, than a
single-strait, or a narrow pathway, which are not uncommon in forests.</p>
