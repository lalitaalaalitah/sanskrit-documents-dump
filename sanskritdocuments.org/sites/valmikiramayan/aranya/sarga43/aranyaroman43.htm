<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
On spotting the deer Seetha calls Rama and Lakshmana to have sight of it. Lakshmana immediately concludes 
it to be Maareecha, but Seetha, keeping his observation aside asks Rama to fetch it. Rama is also fascinated 
when he looked at that deer and he explains to Lakshmana as to why that particular deer is to be hunted 
down.</p>

and even that of Lakshmana who is presently weaponed. [3-43-1, 2]</p>

The &#39;Gandharva-city&#39; is the name given to a make-believe formation of a city-like structure in skies 
by magicians, and presently the magicians world over are making the apparent structures to disappear, 
rather than constructing one which is un-manifest.</p>

Hence, oh, lord of the world, this is truly a phantasm. No doubt about it.&quot; So said Lakshmana to Rama. 
[3-43-8]</p>

<p class="comment">
Here the timely provision of data by Lakshmana may be noticed. Rama is also aware of it, but Lakshmana 
is reminding him. Lakshmana cites even the name of Maareecha and by this, we can infer as to why Ravana 
chose Maareecha for this particular purpose. Because Maareecha has that extraordinary ability to lure 
and has a good record of wily accomplishments, Ravana chose him. Lakshmana has done his duty in presenting 
expedient data and it is up to Rama to analyse it. Rama argues on this point later in the chapter.</p>

<em>21. raudram</em> = unruly [nagging]; <em>idam kaama vR^ittam</em> = this sort of, independent behaviour 
- self-seeking; <em>striiNaam</em> = to women; <em>a sadR^isham</em> = not, befitting; <em>matam</em>

&quot;Tradition says that this sort of unruly self-seeking is unbefitting to women, yet that deer&#39;s beautiful 
body is inducing curiosity in me.&quot; Seetha said so to Rama and remained waiting for his reply. [3-43-21]</p>

<p class="comment">
Seetha talked only this much and left the fulfilment of her indent to the discretion of Rama. There 
is neither demand nor compulsion to bring the deer in her talk. But we usually hear the telltale stories, 
bringing from some other texts, which say that Seetha pestered, nagged, and harassed Rama to get this 
deer. But nothing of that sort is evident from the dialogue given to her by Valmiki. She started to 
ask Rama with a suchiH smitaH &#39;a white smile, i.e., a toothy smile or a simpering smile&#39; that too to 
deride the security guard, namely Lakshmana. These security personnel all over the world and in all 
situations and always forewarn the secured, and on the other hand, it is customary to the secured person 
to jump off the cordon of security, disdainful of the security measures. After all, human nature wants 
a free living. Thus, when Seetha is trying to jump off the cordon of security laid by Lakshmana, commentators 
say that she is said to have smiled scornfully. <em>lakshmaNa vaakya shravaNa janita kopaa siitaa raamam 
eva aaha - dk</em> &#39;with the anger generated on listening Lakshmana&#39;s words, Seetha spoke to Rama,&#39; 
Whether Seetha is with kopa &#39;anger&#39; or not, it is unsaid in the text.</p>

As for that deer&#39;s horns they vie with excellent sapphires, its golden coat with the glitter of tender

<p class="comment">
According to this original text, Rama is more lured by the Golden Deer than Seetha, whereas later legends 
made Seetha a scapegoat. Rama too did not fancifully come under the lure but he got his own logistics 
to fall after the deer, which we come across in the following speeches of Rama. The word api &#39;even,&#39; 
is a normal metrical filler at most times, but assumes importance at times. Here Rama is the all knowing 
and all deciding personality as depicted until now, and &#39;even&#39; he is lured by the deer, say Maareecha&#39;s 
supernal trickery.</p>

Kadali, Priaki and Avi are the names of breed of deer that yield best deerskins. It is said in <em>amara

Kadali is the deer with white stripes on its neck that lives in a big burrows. Priyaki will have thick 
brown and black hair and these yield the best and soft deerskin for sitting. AviH is the sheep in breed. 
The word Praveni may perhaps not of a breed of deer as said in amara kosha: <em>aiNeya meNyaaH carmaadyameNaH

<p class="comment">
The first foot &#39;she is the basis of our mission&#39; is a debated expression. Their mission is to eliminate 
Ravana. Seetha as Vedavati, an earlier incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi, vows to eliminate Ravana when 
she comes to earth as Seetha. Then Rama should have said &#39;look Lakshmana, our task is to kill Ravana, 
for that Ravana has to kidnap Seetha, and to make that kidnapping possible do not guard her.&#39; Can he 
say so? Neither Rama, nor any ordinary husband can say so. Then this predictive sentence becomes self-contrary. 
Contrariwise, taking some concessions of grammar, because most of Ramayana is un-Paninian, Rama is indirectly 
hinting Lakshmana that something is immanent, because &#39;after the elimination of demons like Khara, Duushana 
nothing drastic has happened, but a queer deer has come, and thus something may now happen.&#39; Then, if 
this <em>asyaam </em>is given to <em>kartavyam </em>&#39;the enterprise&#39; as <em>tasmin</em> then the connection 
is: <em>asmaakam yat kR^ityam asyaam [tasmin] aayattam asaama </em>&#39;for us, which, enterprise is there, 
in that, circumspect, we shall be&#39; &#39;Which enterprise is there for us individually, in that we both shall 
conduct separately and circumspectly, and you do your job of guarding Seetha and I mine in bringing 
the deer or its skin, duly eliminating that conjuring demon.&#39; In such a case, the blemish soothsaying 
or prophesising will not occur to Rama, in saying &#39;Seetha as the pivotal character is to be kidnapped 
by Ravana&#39; etc. In fact, Rama is the person who is more beguiled by the deer.</p>

The ambiguity is whether Rama is going for the deer, or deerskin, or for the latent demon. He is going 
for the deer epically, for the memento of deerskin to Seetha as a hero of the epic, and for the demon 
in deer, according to mythology.</p>

Lure for Golden Deer</p>

<p class="comment">
Poor Seetha, she could not romanticise the Golden Deer better than Rama. Then it may be asked &#39;what 
is the necessity for Rama to romanticise and compare it to the skyey star-deer and others. Is it for 
the deer or for the deerskin?&#39; This is the unanswered question. &#39;It is for the deer alone but not its 
skin,&#39; said so in reply by some. If it were to be for the deerskin, from the view point of Rama, he 
could have shot his arrow from where he is standing, which arrow miraculously pierces any terrain, kills 
the deer, and safely comes back into his quiver, as in the case of showing his prowess to Sugreeva. 
Otherwise, Rama should have turned down the request of Seetha, as he did in the ninth chapter of this 
Aranya Kanda, when she was saying: &#39;where that weapon? Where this forest? Where the principles of Kshatriya? 
And where is the sageness? All this is inconsistent... By us, let the laws of the land be esteemed...&#39; 
as at 3-9-27. When kings come into such a sort of allurement, many wise men quote this instance of Rama&#39;s 
going after the deer as a reminder to them, as in Maha Bharata.</p>

<p class="comment">
Unborn it was, none has seen yet, nor mentioned about it, such is the mirage of Rama. Parlous time causes 
perilous percipience.</p>

<p class="comment">
Hence Rama&#39;s going after the deer is for the deerskin, on one count, and for the deer itself, on the 
other as affirmed by Lakshmana because Lakshmana never says untruth. This Maareecha is recurrently falling 
after Rama. Once an accident, twice a coincidence, but thrice... a habituation... and it become habitual 
for Maareecha to dare Rama. Hence, Rama has to do something to Maareecha, permanently.</p>

<p class="comment">
The other view according to puranic/mythological sayings is that god endows whatever you seek. But that 
god alone says: &#39;Seek you will get it, but seek not by the extrinsic values of objects.&#39; This saying 
has it counterpart at: &#39;Every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.&#39; St Matthew, p[Ch. 
7, v. 8] The Bible. But &#39;seek something within the nature, according to your nature... but not the supernatural... 
for eyes belie the nature of objects...&#39; is the essence here. He/she who seeks beyond means will have 
to suffer, either by getting it or devoid of it. This is said in innuendo at 3-43-33, that &#39;the results 
of pipedreams fill the coffers of Shukra.&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Further, because parlous time has come to Rama and Seetha, epically, providentially, and episodically, 
Rama has to move away from Seetha. While going after the deer, Rama says much to Lakshmana about the 
security to Seetha and also informs him that &#39;she is pivotal to our mission.&#39; He did not say these many 
farewells when sending Seetha and Lakshmana for hiding in a cave at the time of elimination Khara, Duushana, 
and the other fourteen thousand demons. At one time Rama spared Maareecha&#39;s life in the forest of Tataka 
while guarding Vishwamitra&#39;s ritual, only to cause Maareecha to come now. As such, Rama has to go after 
Maareecha. Besides, Seetha or Goddess Lakshmi will let none killed in her presence.</p>
