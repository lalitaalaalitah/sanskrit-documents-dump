<p class="tat">On smashing the mace with arrows Raghava spoke this sentence to Khara smiling him
out of temper, without assaulting weaponless and flustering Khara, because Rama is the patron of
virtue following the protocol of righteous war. </p>
<p class="comment">This seems to be a roundabout meaning. But to explain why the epithet <em>dharma
vatsala</em> to Rama is given, this beating round the bush is necessary. So also, many epithets
used in this epic have relevance to the circumstances, characters, or their actions. These cannot
be explained without the support of commentaries, and unfortunately commentaries skip these minor
details assuming that the readers are capable enough to grasp them in the course of narration,
which resulted otherwise at a later time. We therefore request pundits to consolidate the relevancy
of each the inordinate epithet used to the situations narrated somewhere like web, if it is going
to cost a fortune on printing and stationary. Explaining them occasionally is unnoticed, and they
appear to be redundant metre fillers in these days where Sanskrit itself has become an alienated
language.</p>
<p class="tat">"So, this is all the strength of yours and your army that is displayed and nothing
more to display, is it! You wretched demon, it is paltriest compared to my strength, yet you vaunt
aloud futilely! This mace of yours in which you repose your bombastic aplomb, now completely
battered with my arrows has gone onto the surface of earth, so also is your vanity. "What that is
said by you, 'I will dab the tears of the demons whose kinfolk are dead here...' even this word of
yours is a fake.</p>
<p class="tat">"In boasting you are knavish, in character roguish, and in behaviour ghoulish, such
a demon as you are, I will take your life away as the Divine Eagle Garuda took away Ambrosia. Now,
my arrows will rip and chop off your throat, and then the earth will guzzle the blood gushed
therefrom garnished with froth and foam. You will go to eternal sleep embracing the earth as you
embrace an un-gainable lady, when both of your arms are knocked down to slide on earth, and limbs
smeared with dirt. While you are in profound sleep, oh, notorious demon, this Dandaka forest
becomes a shelter to the shelter-worthy sages and saints. </p>
<p class="tat">"When the strongholds of demons in your Janasthaana are ruined with my arrows, the
sages in this forest will move about everywhere, fearlessly. The demonesses who terrorized others
so far will be pitiably terrorised now, and they flee away very quickly with tear-wet faces as
their kinsmen are killed. "To which demonesses your kind of grievous demon is the husband, they
must have taken birth in a befittingly grievous family like that of yours, and must be well-matched
to you in grievous atrocities, and though they might not have tasted a grievous situation so far,
since their lives have become meaningless, now they will become the enjoyers of the empathy of
grief. </p>
<p class="tat">"You are atrocious in conduct because you countervail against Veda-s, debased by
conscience because you counteract to Vedic rituals, and you are countermanding Vedic procedures
because you have always been bothersome to Brahmans, and those Brahmans becoming sceptical of your
deeds of hindrance, they are hesitatingly consigning oblations into Ritual-Fire, which are to be
swiftly dropped into fire to the chants of hymns and even on time, hence you are countervailing
against Veda-s and counteracting to their rituals, and countermanding their procedures." Thus Rama
spoke to Khara irefully. </p>
<p class="tat">While Raghava is speaking that way with such an impetuosity in that forest, Khara
started to intimidate him rancorously in a voice stridulous than braying. </p>
<p class="tat">"Priding yourself resolutely you are unfearing even in a fearful situation, thereby
you have indeed gone into the control of death, and for sure you are unmindful of what is speakable
and what is not." Thus, Khara started his tongue-lashing. Such of those men on whom the Lead of the
Time verily closes in, they will not know what is to be done and what not, for all of their six
senses will be rendered insensible." Thus Khara intimidated Rama. </p>
<p class="comment">dhvani/allusion: For the above three verses it said: <em>evam bruvaaNam
raamam</em> 'to Rama who saying that way...' <em>mR^ityu vashya kharaH</em> 'Khara going under the
control of Death...' is saying 'oh, Rama...' <em>tvam vaacya a+vaacya na budhyase iti</em> 'you
know not what to speak and what not to speak - to a dying creature like me, because that creature's
six-senses are stand-still...' Then why is this <em>nirbhartsayana, roSa?</em> 'threatening me, and
anger at me?' 'Because the faculties of that dying creatures, presently mine, will be in a flux,
they will attack anyone verbally or physically, let alone the Almighty... thus you are not able to
distinguish between what is to be done or not to be done with such a senseless creature... So, what
you have to do now is to finish me, and what is not to be done is this sermonising. Why not finish
me off from this curse and accord salvation?' Maheshvara Tiirtha. 
<em>anena maraNa samaye janaanaam buddhi bhramsho bhavati iti sUchitam - dk</em> &#39; &#39;at the time of 
death people&#39;s mind deranges...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">Saying so to Rama that nightwalker Khara then knitting his brows tightly saw
everywhere for an assault weapon for use in that combat, and then he indeed found one not far away
from him, namely a huge saala tree. He curled his lips in frown and started to extricate that Saala
tree, and that great-mighty Khara on forcefully uprooting that tree with both of hands hurled it
aiming at Rama, braying loudly and shouting at him 'you are dead...' </p>

<p class="tat">But that adventurous Rama on shredding that tree which is swooping down with a
torrent of arrows, and deciding to eliminate that Khara in that war evoked an unusual rancour,
which rancour is equally an unusual facet of Rama. </p>
<p class="comment">The inveterate bitterness of Rama is to see the unyielding Khara at a time when
all of his war paraphernalia is lost, but still trying to be aggressive, rancorously.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama whose body is perspiring and whose eyes are acrimoniously bloodshot at ends, he
utterly shredded Khara with a thousand arrows in that war.Copious frothy blood gushed out from the
gashes of arrows on the mountainous body of Khara, like the rapids on Mt. Prasavana, and it
overflowed on earth too. </p>
<p class="comment">Mt. Prasavana is depicted in Kishkindha canto where Rama admires and eulogises
the rainy season when waiting for Sugreeva's help.</p>
<p class="tat">When Khara is tormented with the arrows of Rama in that conflict he is bedevilled
and with his blood stinking body he quickly bolted towards that Rama alone. When Khara is
descending on boisterously with his body bathed in blood, that adept one in the Science of Archery,
<font color="#B3003A">dhanur veda</font> , the scripture on archery, and that valorous Rama, in
swiftness lurched a little...say, two or three steps... </p>

<p class="comment">
On this back stepping, backtracking, or the scrape Rama took in war, [ scrape - intr. draw back a foot 
in making a clumsy bow; and here without clumsiness of bow]; much discussion is available discussing 
whether Rama can retrace his step or not. It is said that stepping back in war is prohibited for a valorous 
warrior or to the epical hero. <em>sa~Ngraame sa~Nsthaanam anivR^ittiH ca - gautama</em> and many more 
scriptures say this. And a relaxation to such a stance is said: <em>kvacit ati sankaTa viShaye subhaTaanaam 
abhito ayam apasarpaH - vedaanta deshika</em> But here Rama is taking a runner&#39;s back-leg and it is 
not to be construed as an act of cowardice. Dharmaakuutam clarifies this as: <em>vasca shatru vadhe 
kaamayamaana raamsya dhanuShi baaNa sandhaana aadi saukaryaartham apasarpaNam raameNa kR^itam bhuuShaNam 
eva na tu duuShaNam | ata eva muule apasarpaNe kR^ita astram eva hetumatvena maharShiNaa upanyastham 
| anantara shlokena khara vadaaya shara sandhaana mokShaNa aadi pratipaadanam upapannam bhavati | bhityaa 
apasarpaNe punaH shara mokSha anupapatto riti | dk</em> &#39;Wishing to eliminate the demon Rama has taken 
a back step. It is only to have a leeway between his target, arrow, and arrow-flinging place... In the 
verse itself the great-sage Valmiki incorporated words like <em>kR^ita astra</em> that Rama is an exponent 
in archery [keeping some doubting Thomas&#39; in view.] Further, in the next few verses Rama eliminates 
Khara, thus it is not an act of cowardice...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
More so, some scholars hold that this verse has got grammatical glitches, some ancient mms reads this 
verse as, even though this verse too has the word <em>apasarpaNa</em> scrape:
<em>tam aapatantam 
vegena iiptaasyam rudhira plutam | apasR^itya tataH sthaanaat dR^iShTvaa tvarita vikramaH |</em></p>

<p class="tat">Then, Rama snatched an arrow which is similar to the Ritual-fire, and secondary only
to the ultimate missile, namely the Brahma-missile, for the elimination of Khara in war. That
particular arrow is made available to Rama through Sage Agastya by the king of gods, namely Indra,
because Indra is a sensible one about the future course of events, and he is also prosperous in
securing impossible weaponry, and now Rama fitted such an arrow on his bow and released it towards
Khara. </p>
<p class="tat">That formidable arrow is promptly released on Rama's stretching the bowstring up to
his ear, bending bow almost to a circularity, and which arrow is thunderous while in egress like
the thunder of a thunderbolt, and that has come and plunged in the chest of Khara. </p>
<p class="tat">Khara fell down on to earth and on being burnt by the radiation of that arrow he is
like demon Andhaka, who once was very completely burnt by Rudra in Shveta-araNya, the White-forest.
</p>
<p class="comment">Andhaka is the son of Danu, the wife of Kashyapa Prajaapati, and her progeny is
termed as daanava-s, demons. Shiva burns this Andhaka with his Third-eye in Shveta-forest, which is
said to be at the confluence point of River Kauvery in ocean.</p>
<p class="tat">As with fall of demon Vritta or fall of demon Bala who are eliminated by Indra with
his Thunderbolt, or as with the collapse of demon Namuchi who is eliminated by the same Indra just
with forth or foam, Khara too is brought down. </p>
<p class="comment">The demon Namuchi secures a boon from the gods that he may not die by wetness or
dryness, so Indra uses foam and forth, which are neither wet nor dry, to eliminated him.</p>
<p class="tat">In this meantime gods gathering along with carana-s drummed celestial drums from all
over and showered flowers on Rama from all over. And those gods and other celestials in their
amazement said among themselves that 'in one and half hours, say seventy two minutes of this
extreme crack-down Rama with his sharp arrows has eradicated fourteen thousand guise changing
demons, including their chieftains Khara and Duushana. [</p>
<p class="tat">"Aha! Surprising is this great deed of Rama, the shrewd-soul, what a valour, what a
fortitude, really, his valour and fortitude are like those of Vishnu..." Thus saying that way all
of those gods have gone away as the have come. </p>
<p class="tat">All the kingly-sages and elite-sages along with Sage Agastya, who as incidentally
came here to witness the victory of Rama, then on foregathering near at Rama delightedly said this
on adoring him. "He that great-resplendent one, the controller of demon Paka, and the destroyer of
enemy's cities, namely Indra, once came to the meritorious hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga only for
the purpose such an elimination of demons. For the purpose of eradicating these demons who are the
evildoers by nature and the natural enemies to saintly people you are led to this countryside by
the great sages with an ideation. That which is the task of ours it is accomplished by you, oh, son
of Dasharatha, now that Dandaka is unimpeded these great-sages will be practising their respective
sacred devoirs in it." Thus, the sages expressed their thanksgiving. </p>
<p class="tat">In the meanwhile the brave Lakshmana exiting from the mountain cave came along with
Seetha to their hermitage, and he is charmed at the victory of his brother Rama. And then that
brave and victories Rama too came towards hermitage while great-sages reverenced him, and he
entered the hermitage while Lakshmana came forward to greet him. </p>
<p class="tat">And Seetha on seeing her husband, the eliminator of enemies and accorder of
happiness to sages, embraced her husband Rama, rejoicingly. Janaka's daughter Seetha on seeing the
hordes of demons eliminated, and even on observing her husband is also scatheless, she is
all-smiles for him smiling sniggeringly. </p>
<p class="comment">Any wife on seeing her husband returning from a risky journey will embrace her
husband delightfully, and nothing special about it. But the commentators attach a great
significance to this situation.</p>

<p class="verloc">---</p>

<p class="comment">Firstly Seetha is <em>hR^iSTaa</em> &#39;exultant...&#39; 
more than happiness. Rama&#39;s victory is the cause for that. <em>sati dharmiNi dharmaaH</em> 
&#39;nature will have its own peculiar property...&#39; Rama&#39;s victory is the peculiar property
<em>dharmi</em>, and the exultancy caused is its nature <em>dharma</em>.
<em>hR^iSTaa</em> &#39;exulted&#39; &#39;thrilling, hair-raising, electrifying&#39; &#39;as though the 
inner joy is going to outburst trough the skin pores...&#39; Such is the joy of Seetha.</p>

<p class="comment">The cause for the extreme exultancy is said next.
<em>Vaidehi</em>, is the daughter of Videha King, Janaka and when she is said so, 
it is remembered that <em>mithila adhipatiH viiraH</em> &#39;Mithila&#39;s king is the bravest 
of the brave...&#39; Thus, she is aware what bravery and victory are, and knowing that she hailed her victorious 
husband, for she is a worthy princess. <em>bhartaaram pariSvaje</em> &#39;husband, embraced...&#39; 
Is Rama a husband of Seetha or to total Universe? <em>loka bhartaaram suSuveya</em>. 
He is the husband of the total Universe. When she is the mother of all beings in the universe, and when 
her husband protects her progeny from the evildoers, will she not embrace that husband of hers, as well 
as of the Universe? The word <em>bharta</em> &#39;one who bears...&#39; and this Rama has 
no other burden to bear, except the Universe.</p>

<p class="comment">This embracing is <em>pariSvaje, pari sa svaje</em> 
&#39;wholly embraced.&#39; She embraced him from all over and fomented his war-wounds with her warm breasts. 
Then, why for this much happy hugging? It is replied: <em>maharSiiNaam sukha aavaham 
pariSvaje</em> &#39;one who brought comfort to great-sages, him she embraced...&#39; The great-sages are her 
children, supplicating her to recommend to the Supreme Being to bestow His grace for their salvation. 
Since Rama brought some relief by his paternal affection to these children-like sages, she is happy 
and hugging.</p>

<p class="comment">Seetha came out of a mountain cave and embraced Rama. This suggests 
that the innate soul <em>sheSi</em> on the advise of a teacher, after leaving the 
cave-like living being, is released from bondages and embraces the master <em>sheShin</em>. 
This is the same predicament for her in Sundara Kanda, where the teacher Hanuma advises her to come 
with him, but she refuses, because her lord alone has to come conquering, as he has done now as far 
as her confinement is concerned. Here she is put in cave and guarded by Lakshmana, unlike demonesses 
guarding her in open-air gardens in Lanka. She came out of the cave and is joining her husband. Govindaraja.</p>

<p class="comment">Next, Maheshvara Tiirtha records: <em>tam dR^iSTvaa 
shatru hantaaram</em> &#39;at him Rama, on seeing, enemy, eliminator...&#39;in that compound:
<em>tam</em> &#39;at him...&#39; that Rama, which one-Rama assumed himself as fourteen thousand 
Rama-s, appearing as each to each demon at the time of war, with his divinely gracious aspect
<em>divya mangala vigraha</em> and eliminated all demons, that Rama she saw.
<em>te tu yaavanta evaa~Nau taavaan tu dadR^ishe sataiH</em> As many demons are 
there, so many Rama-s are there on the battlefield.</p>

<p class="comment"><em>tam</em> &#39;at him...&#39; &#39;who eliminated fourteen 
thousand demons, single-handedly, , that too in seventy two minutes. These demons are so far undeafted 
even by Indra with all his forces. Rama defeated such demons without any damage to his person,
<em>a + vyayam</em> &#39;unscathed, undamaged... and very easily also...&#39; at such a 
Rama Seetha saw.</p>

<p class="comment"><em>tam</em> &#39;him&#39; who looks girlish. Seetha 
once said that Rama is girly not only in his looks but also in bravery, perhaps.

<em>raama jaamaataram 
praapya striyam puruSha vigraham</em> Ayodhya Part I, 30-3. When Rama dissuades Seetha from 
coming to forests, Seetha said to Rama, &#39;my father is the King of Mithila and he may think that you 
have left me behind at Ayodhya unable to protect me in forests... thus my father may also think that 
he got a &#39;girl&#39; as his son-in-law in you...&#39; Through this is a tongue-in-cheek expression Seetha reminded 
Rama at that situation of his <em>Mohini ruupa</em> &#39;getup of Mohini...&#39; which he 
assumed at the time of churning Milky Ocean, it is her woomanhood that spoke like that. Though not then, 
even now Rama looks girlishly pleasant, if he is not summoning wrath upon him, as per his attributes,
<em>puNDarika vishaala aksha, somavat priya darshanaH</em> &#39;lotus-petal-eyed, moon-like-delightful-aspect...&#39; 
And he becomes unsightly, only if angered. Such a girlish Rama has won war, and at him Seetha saw in 
admiration about his mannishness. Now her father Janaka will definitely appreciate his son-in-law Rama. 
King Janaka is a result-oriented king, as said in Gita, 3-20: <em>karmaNi evahi samsiddham 
aasthitaH janakaadayaH</em> &#39;Janaka and others are involved in self-less- result-oriented deeds...&#39; 
and facing him without results is impossible. Thus Seetha&#39;s opinion is &#39;my father Janaka who is result-oriented 
and self-less in his pursuits, he will now appreciate Rama, since Rama has also accomplished a self-less 
pursuit in saving the sages...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment"><em>tam shatru hantaaram</em> &#39;at him... who 
has annihilated the enemies in war...&#39; as he has annihilated troops and troops of unwieldy demons as 
said at: <em>taiH dhanuu~NShi 
dhvaja agraaNi carmaaNi ca shiraa~Nsi ca || 3-25-21 and at bahuun sa hasta aabharaNaan uuruun kari kara 
upamaan | 3-25-22 [A]</em> and also who later said that he will emerge, as and when needed 
to eradicate vice, as at <em>paritraNaaya saadhuunaam vinaashaaya ca duSkR^itaam - 
Gita: 4-8</em> And Seetha saw at such an omnipotent Being who is an eliminator of evil.</p>

<p class="comment"><em>maharSiNaam sukha aavaham</em> &#39;for great-sages, 
accorder of comfort...&#39; <em>dR^iSTvaa vaidehii babhuuva</em> &#39;on seeing Vaidehi 
became...&#39; she became one with herself <em>bhuu sattaayaam</em>. When it is said
<em>aatmaa vai puruSasya daaraa</em> &#39;wife indeed is the soul of manl...&#39; that soul 
of Rama, namely Seetha is so far in a dilemma, because Rama is a lone-warrior against fourteen-thousand 
demons and his safe return is ambiguous. Now that he remained unhurt, that soul called Seetha, has regained 
her abode in Rama. Then <em>hR^iSTaa pariSvaje</em> &#39;delightfully embraced...&#39; Maheshvara 
Tiirtha.</p>

<p class="comment">Dharmaakuutam also derives the same meanings, but with reference 
to dharma:</p>

<p class="comment">
<em class="comment"><em>siitaa -- anaparaadhi raakShasa jana vadho na ucita iti vaidehii kR^ita pratiShedham api - apyaham jiivitam
