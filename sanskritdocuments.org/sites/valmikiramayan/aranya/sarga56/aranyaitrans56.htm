<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 56<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Seetha reprimands Ravana in saying that her unswerving devotion to Rama will not permit her to be dominated 
by anyone. She gives word-by-word replies to all that is prattled by Ravana in earlier chapter. A discussion 
about Seetha&#39;s stance and stability is given in the endnote of this chapter.</p>

saa tathaa uktaa tu vaidehii nirbhayaa shoka karshitaa |<br>tR^iNam antarataH kR^itvaa raavaNam prati 
abhaaShata || 3-56-1</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. tathaa uktaa</em> = in that way, she who is addressed; <em>shoka karshitaa</em> = by anguish, 
haggard; <em>saa vaidehii tu</em> = she, Vaidehi, on her part; <em>nir bhayaa</em> = without, fear [boldly];
<em>tR^iNam antarataH kR^itvaa</em> = straw-blade, in between, on making [placing]; <em>raavaNam</em> 
= to Ravana; <em>prati abhaaSata</em> = counter, spoke - castigated.</p>

<p class="tat">
She that Vaidehi who is haggard by anguish boldly spoke to Ravana when he addressed her in that way, 
duly placing a blade of straw in between herself and Ravana. [3-56-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
The place of conversation is a speckles palace and then where from a blade of straw is available to 
Seetha to place in between them - is the question. It is adjusted by saying that a straw blade stuck 
to her sari, which she removed and placed in between. Has she searched whole of sari, inch by inch, 
for a blade of straw that too to talk to a debased character - is its counter-question. Anyway she treated 
Ravana just as a worthless straw - is another viewpoint. Either way, &#39;husband-devout&#39; wives do not chat 
with &#39;the other&#39; males without making an improvised screen in between, may it be a half-veil, a door, 
or any other item that prevent the vilely ogles of others.</p>

<p class="comment">
She is also said to be talking &#39;boldly...&#39; where this boldness is the derivative of her self-assured 
&#39;husband-devoutness.&#39; When this boldness is there why she is emaciated through sadness - is the collateral 
question. For this, it is said that her wailing is not for herself, but for her separation from Rama, 
coupled with her thinking about Rama&#39;s miseries in forest, besides, due to the ambiguity about Lakshmana&#39;s 
meeting with Rama or otherwise.</p>

<p class="comment">
Tilaka says, &#39;Seetha is aware of the curse of Ravana that his heads get splintered into pieces if he 
makes advances to any female without her consent, hence Seetha is talking fearlessly. And if Ravana 
tries to make any further advances, Seetha is ready to disappear, as is the practice with gods, or to 
become an untouchable entity, like a hologram...&#39; But this is negated, taking Seetha as a human level 
entity rather than an incarnation, saying that &#39;human Seetha is unaware of Ravana himself, thus her 
becoming aware of his curse is untenable...&#39; Maybe, Goddess Lakshmi or Maya Seetha is aware of that 
curse of Ravana.</p>

raajaa dasharatho naama dharma setuH iva acalaH |<br>satya sandhaH parij~naato yasya putraH sa raaghavaH 
|| 3-56-2</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>2. dasharathaH naama raajaa</em> = Dasharatha, known as, king; <em>a calaH</em> = unwavering [resolute];
<em>dharma setuH iva</em> = for righteousness, rampart, like; <em>satya sandhaH</em> = forthrightness, 
he abide by; <em>pari j~naataH</em> = overly, known [well renowned one]; <em>saH raaghavaH</em> = he 
that, Raghava - Rama; <em>yasya putraH</em> = whose, son; <em>[saH patiH mama</em> = such a Raghava, 
husband, of mine.]</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;He whose son is Raghava, is a resolute king known as Dasharatha. That king is a kingly rampart for 
righteousness, a kingpin abiding in forthrightness and thereby his kingliness is well renowned in all 
worlds, and my husband Rama is such a king&#39;s son. [3-56-2]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word used <em>setu</em> also means a &#39;bridge&#39; apart from a rampart. Thus Dasharatha is not only 
a rampart &#39;a defensive wall with a broad top and usu. a stone parapet...&#39; for the defence of <em>dharma</em> 
from its mismanagement, but he is also the bridge between <em>a dharma</em> and <em>dharma.</em> Thus 
this bridge called Dasharatha enables anyone to crossover it towards <em>dharma.</em> That bridge called 
Dasharatha allowed Rama to cross and to reach forests for the annihilation of demons.</p>

<p class="comment">
Therefore, Seetha is saying &#39;being such a righteous king&#39;s daughter-in-law, I cannot bring blemish to 
my in-laws, or to their dynasty in surrendering to you... furthermore, my husband is the one from such 
a dynasty who never tolerates unrighteousness...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
And by taking the name of Dasharatha, where <em>dasha ratha</em> &#39;ten way charioteer, or charioteer 
of ten chariots...&#39; she is explaining &#39;my father-in-law chariots his one chariot in ten ways, whereas 
you can steer only one in one way, called lust... my father-in-law chariots ten chariots in a single 
instance, whereas you can handle only one, at any given time besides being dependent on the capability 
of auto-propelling Pushpaka aircraft, rather than on your own steersman&#39;s capability...</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>3. [yasya dasharasya putraH</em> = which, Dasharatha&#39;s, son is]; who is; <em>triSu lokeSu vishrutaH</em> 
= in three, worlds, highly, renowned; <em>diirgha baahuH</em> = lengthy, armed one [having ambidexterity];
<em>vishaala akSaH</em> = wide, eyed [eagle-eyed, having perspicacity]; <em>raamaH naama</em> = Rama, 
known as; <em>saH dharma aatmaa</em> = he, virtue-souled one; <em>mama patiH</em> = my, husband; and;
<em>daivatam</em> = [my] godlike.]</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Such a Dasharatha&#39;s son who is virtue-souled one, who is highly renowned in all the three worlds for 
his ambidexterity and perspicacity, and who is known as Rama is my husband and a god to me. [3-56-3]</p>

<p class="comment">
Annex: &#39;And he is named as Rama because he causes rejoice in one and all, thus he is well renowned in 
all worlds, unlike you who are named as Ravana, meaning that &#39;the one who makes one and all rueful...&#39; 
thus you are also well renowned in the worlds, but by your notoriety. On the other hand Rama is virtue-souled, 
unlike you a virtueless, meritless and lawless knave... and his ambidexterity contrasts with your guile-handedness, 
while his perceptiveness with your purblindness of the proximate problem of yours... such a husband&#39;s 
wife as I am, how do you think that I on my own get estranged from such a godlike husband of mine, unrighteously...</p>

ikShvaakuuNaam kule jaataH siMha skandho mahaadyutiH |<br>lakShmaNena saha bhraatraa yaH te praaNaan 
hariShyati || 3-56-4</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>4. ikSvaakuuNaam kule jaataH</em> = in Ikshvaku&#39;s, dynasty, born in; <em>simha skandhaH</em> = lion, 
shoulders; <em>mahaa dyutiH</em> = great, resplendent one; <em>bhraatraa lakSmaNena saha</em> = brother, 
with Lakshmana, along with; <em>yaH te praaNaan hariSyati</em> = who, your, lives, will take away.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;He who took birth in Ikshvaku&#39;s dynasty is a great-resplendent one with his shoulders like those of 
a lion, and who comes here along with similarly lion-shouldered and nearly great-resplendent brother 
of his, namely Lakshmana, to take your lives away. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-4]</p>

<p class="comment">
Annex: Ravana asked Seetha at 3-55-21 &#39;what can you achieve with that dethroned, hapless, seer, vagrant 
Rama and who is short-lived, for after all, he is a human with littlest vitality?&#39; Thus belittling Rama&#39;s 
possessions in the shape of palaces, riches and kingdoms. For that Seetha is now saying that Rama does 
not possess anything, but the whole world is possessed of him. <em>saha lakshmaNa= sa ha lakshmaNa ; 
cihnaa naamno saha lakshmii ke saumitrau saa rasa striyaam</em> &#39;Supreme Person&#39;s possession is the 
eternal opulence of the Universe...&#39; <em>para brahma mantraNayo</em> &#39;one achievable by constant meditation 
upon Him alone...&#39; To such Rama now adjoined is Lakshmana, the personified prosperity. As such, that 
Supreme Splendour has taken incarnation as Rama because of the curse of Anaranya. Thus, Seetha took 
the name of Ikshvaku dynasty.</p>

<p class="comment">
The curse of Anaranya: Anaranya is the ancestor of Rama in Ikshvaku dynasty. His son is Haryashva, a 
grandparent of Rama. When Ravana subjugated Anaranya, dying Anaranya curses Ravana to die at the hands 
of his great-grandson Rama in later generations.</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;Such Ikshvaku will now come along with prosperous Lakshmana not only to belittle your opulence of falsity, 
but also to terminate such a vainglorious mischief... thus foxlike creatures like you cannot dare a 
lion, for he is lion-shouldered... and because you foxed Rama you are still alive, otherwise...&#39; - continuation 
with next verse.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Had I been forcibly humiliated by you in the presence of Rama, you too would have been killed by Rama 
in combat and by now you too would be sprawling on earth, as with Khara in Janasthaana, but you foxed 
him. However, such Rama is my husband. [3-56-5]</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Those demons who are spoken of you to be with ghastly forms and gruelling power, they all will become 
formless and powerless in face of Raghava, as with all snakes becoming non-poisonous earthworms in the 
face of Garuda, the Divine Eagle. Such Rama is my husband. [3-56-6]</p>

<p class="comment">
Annex: &#39;You said that you have millions and millions of ghastly demons... but where are they, in the 
backyard of your house and behind your back? None has surfaced so far to confront my husband, for they 
are nothing but your kitchenware... and thus you are a <em>gehe shuuraH</em>&#39;a champion in your own 
home... a paper tiger...&#39; boastful of your paper-thin-tigerish-ness before me, a solitary woman... thus 
you and your forces will be rendered ineffectual the minute you confront my husband...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Those gilded arrows of Rama unloosened directly and unswervingly from his bowstring will utterly batter

<p class="comment">
Annex: &#39;Maybe god or demons or others, other than humans, cannot kill you... why the humans were slighted 
by you as your killing agents at the time of your seeking boons from Brahma, or at least at the time 
of my abduction why humans are disregarded... hence, that heedlessness alone becomes the very cause

&quot;That mighty Rama will become the terminator of the vestige of your life, and as with an animal fastened

Annex: &#39;Even the beasts like cattle and goats when herded towards a slaughterhouse they will be apprehensively 
fearsome and walk closely and snugly, for they know not what will become of them... and for your part, 
your intellect is far too low than that of a beastie bovine... and you say vaingloriously that everything 
in every world fears you... firstly you fear for yourself as an animal tied to a stake...</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;Rama&#39;s life itself is <em>yaj~na</em> &#39;a sacrificial ritual...&#39; his actions are ritualistic performances... 
in which he sacrifices <em>a dharma</em> for the sake of <em>dharma</em> even by sacrificing his own 
comforts... and you said of him as a &#39;vagrant...&#39; yes, his <em>yaj~na</em> is to be performed not by 
sitting in some hall of ritual, but meandering vagrantly... because entire earth is his hall of ritual... 
and now, you as a sacrificial beast are fastened to the stake of sacrifice by a rope called Seetha, 
and you be ready awaiting for your slaughter in that <em>raama yaj~na</em></p>

<p class="comment">
This expression <em>caNDaal</em> has its own impact. Though this is amplified elsewhere it is reiterated 
here also. The nomenclature of <em>caNDaal</em> is not the present day &#39;untouchable&#39; &#39;outcaste&#39; or a 
&#39;pariah&#39; etc., because he is also a member and an important functionary in Hindu system of castes. The 
analogy is between the Vedic-scholar and profaner, [meaning: one who is not initiated into religious 
rites or any esoteric knowledge...] and between the Altar of Fire and Fire of Pyre, and between the 
Vedic Ritual and Funeral Rites, both involving Vedic-hymns. A Vedic scholar may perhaps conduct a
<em>yaj~na</em> but he is no authority to conduct <em>antya kriya</em> &#39;funerals&#39; till its end. At best, 
a priest&#39;s function is until the lighting of the pyre, and even perhaps until <em>kapaala moksha</em> 
&#39;breakage of cranium...&#39; and from then on it is the function of this <em>caNDaal</em> to take care of 
the corpse consigned to fire and for its complete cremation, since leaving half burnt corpse to vultures 
and foxes or wolves, is sinning. Thus, if a Vedic scholar conducts <em>jaata aadi kriyaaH</em> &#39;rites 
from birth onwards...&#39; as an initiator, whereas a <em>caNDaal</em> conducts <em>antya, uttara kriyaaH</em> 
&#39;rites of death afterwards...&#39; as a terminator. Thus, Ravana being a Vedic scholar is now conducting 
himself as a self-cremator.</p>

Maithili knows no peace when the bizarre-eyed demonesses have highly intimidated her, and by shut-seeing 
those demonesses her reminiscences went over to her dear husband and about her brother-in-law Lakshmana 
too, and when she felt about the improbability of their coming here, she is distraught with alarm and 
anguish, and then she swooned. [3-56-36]</p>

An enigma called - Seetha</p>

<p class="comment">Is Seetha really the Goddess Lakshmi? This question 
is often raised and answered by commentators. Ravana kidnapped umpteen numbers of beautiful women and 
goddess, but why his dialogues with Seetha are given many shades of meanings by all most all commentators. 
Is this for proving Ravana as devotee or else to prove that Seetha is not a human but Goddess Lakshmi 
- is the collateral objection. Apparently, Seetha is behaving like a normal woman but latently her speeches, 
verbiage, or the words put by Valmiki on her tongue, indicate that she is an all-powerful enigma... 
without saying who she is.</p>

<p class="comment">If she is an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi how 
then can Ravana lift her up and carry this far - is the next dilemma, because Ravana&#39;s strength becomes 
useless to lift up Lakshmana who swooned on the battlefield when Ravana used Shakti missile. In Yuddha 
Kaanda Ch. 59 verse 111 it is said: <em>himavaan 
mandaro meroH trai lokyam vaa saha amaraiH | shakyam bhujaabhyaam uddhartum na shakyo bharata anujaH</em></p>

<p class="comment">&#39;Ravana may have lifted Mt. Himavan, 
Mt. Mandara, Mt. Meru or all the three worlds along with all gods, but he could not lift up Bharata&#39;s 
brother Lakshmana with both of his shoulders...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">Ravana wanted to distance fiercer Lakshmana from 
Rama so that Rama&#39;s intensity of warring lessens. Then an episode of this lifting occurs and Hanuma 
on seeing this comes to Ravana and hits Ravana with fist, by which Ravana falls distantly with blood 
effusing from eyes, ears, and mouth. Then Hanuma easily lifts up Lakshmana and takes him to Rama. A 
man in swoon will not weigh differently to two different lifters. How then Ravana could not lift Lakshmana, 
which is not at all a great feat to Hanuma? For this the very next verse 112 gives a reply saying that:</p>

<p class="comment">&#39;even if Lakshmana is hit by Shakti 
missile of Brahma, he is conscious of himself as an unimaginable entity of God Vishnu, so Ravana could 
not lift Lakshmana. Whereas Hanuma happened to be a true devotee of God Almighty, he could easily lift 
Lakshmana...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">Then the original topic of Ravana&#39;s lifting and 
carrying off Seetha comes to fore. She is also another unimaginable entity of Supreme Person. How then 
can Ravana lift her? For this it is said that Seetha allowed herself to be carried off by Ravana as 
she pledged in the incarnation of Vedavati.</p>

<p class="comment">The legend goes on to say that Vedavati is the 
brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati only to Vishnu in marriage. 
But it is an unfulfilled desire in his lifetime. Then Vedavati starts a rigorous penance to achieve 
her father&#39;s wish. When she is at the culmination point of her penance, Ravana passing that way in skyway 
sees this beautiful lady, nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation curses 
Ravana saying that she will reincarnate herself to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. Then she causes 
a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. Ravana took this as prattle by a woman-hermit, dismisses that 
curse, and conveniently forgets it.</p>

<p class="comment">Later, Ravana being an ardent devotee of Shiva, 
on one day when he enters a lake to get lotuses for his daily worship of Shiva, and finds among lotuses 
a baby in a lotus. He brings that lotus and the baby to his palace, in all his fondness for children. 
But his empress Mandodari doubts the arrival of this baby in lotus and recognises that baby as Goddess 
Lakshmi. They consult their teachers about that baby&#39;s arrival. Those teachers, priests and pundits 
advise to get rid of this baby immediately, for she is Vedavati, arrived here only to end Ravana and 
his dynasty. Then Mandodari orders the servants to carry away this baby in a casket, and bury it.</p>

<p class="comment">Empress Mandodari further curses that girl saying: 
&#39;this faithless girl [for Wealth has no faithfulness, and this girl is recognised as Goddess Lakshmi 
- presiding deity of Wealth,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses conquered, 
and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though wealthy and supreme by himself, 
will care nothing for the riches but view whole of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial 
attitude...&#39; Mandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal world, 
and thus presumed this curse to be twisty. But there is King Janaka who has all these attributes. A 
king without ego, wealthy one living simple, childless but yet does not crave for children, like King 
Dasharatha. Hence, he is called <em>raajarshi</em> a saintly king. While King Janaka 
was about to perform a Vedic ritual, he had to till some piece of land as a ceremonial act to commence 
that ritual. Then this casket with the baby is touched to the blade at the end of plough-beam and that 
plough halted. The attendants dug up that area only to find this casket with baby. The childless Janaka 
takes the baby into his arms and names her as &#39;Seetha...&#39; where Seetha in Sanskrit means &#39;furrow.&#39; This 
is as per <em>aananda raamaayaNa</em> Thus, Goddess Lakshmi became Vedavati and 
Vedavati became Seetha of Ramayana, as such Valmiki calls his Ramayana <em>siithaayaH 
charitam mahaan...</em></p>

<p class="comment">Then another counter objection - it is all correct 
to say that all <em>puraaNaa-s</em> say that these characters in Ramayana as gods 
and goddesses, as Vishnu Puraana says <em>raaghavatve havat siitaa rukmiNii kR^iSNa 
jananii</em>. But does Valmiki say it in his epic? For this it is answered, though it is not said 
explicitly there are many instances indicating towards this divinity of Seetha. Seetha asks Fire-god 
to become cool for Hanuma, when his tail is burnt saying <em>siito bhava hanumataa</em> 
and likewise she could have said <em>hato bhava raavaNa</em> &#39;dead you are Ravana...&#39; 
But she does not say so for, because Rama has to undertake that process of elimination of vice called 
Ravana. As Seetha said in Sundara Kanda Ch. 22, verse 20:
<em>a sandeshaat 
tu raamasya tapasaH ca anupaalanaat | na tvaam kurmi dashagriiva bhasma bhasmaarha tejasaa ||</em></p>

<p class="comment">&#39;As I have no indication from 
Rama to burn you down, nor do I wish to waste my ascetic power, therefore I do not burn you to ashes, 
though you are worthy to become a mound of ash...&#39;<em>na apahartum aham shkyaa tvayaa raamasya dhiimataH | vidhiH tava vadha arthaaya vihito na atra samshayaH ||</em></p>

<p class="comment">&#39;I am un-seizable for [any] as 
I am the wife of bold Rama, but it happened so, for you are fated to doom [you could seize me...] undoubtedly...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">Again in 
Yuddha Kanda Brahma in eulogising Rama for eliminating Ravana says in Ch. 117, verse 28:
<em>siitaa lakshmiiH bhavaan viSNuH...</em> &#39;Seetha is Lakshmi and you are Vishnu...&#39; 
Like this, there are many bits and pieces of information to establish her as an incarnate of Vedavati 
alias Goddess Lakshmi. Govindaraja.</p>

<p class="comment">Then why she and Rama behaved 
like humans in their wailing, moaning, and bawling is again a secondary query. This is according to
<em>loka riiti, laukika vidhaana</em> &#39;humanly nature, behaviour in human world...&#39; 
Though this humanly behaviour is not innate trait as Rama says <em>aatmaanam aham 
maanuSam manye</em> &#39;I for myself confess to be human...&#39; Hence this humanly wailing and bawling are 
due to an adopted human behaviour, where incarnation itself is an adaptation.</p>

<p class="comment">Their humanly behaviour 
is to show themselves as one with the humans, asking humans to undergo these series of sufferings to 
eliminate unrighteousness, either in the society or within themselves. Besides, their mission is to 
make believe Ravana that they are just humans, as Ravana is killable by humans and monkeys, but not 
to hoodwink readers, the adherents or all of us put together. Maheshvara Tiirtha.</p>

<p class="comment">This incarceration of Seetha 
in Ashoka gardens is viewed as the incarceration of the innate soul in birthed being&#39;s body. The release 
from that body, namely <em>moksha</em> is achievable only when that being wants 
a perfect release by transcending the threefold nature consisting of <em>sattva, rajas, 
tamo guNaaH</em> &#39;purity, activity and stolidity...&#39; and with an unswerving devotion to the Supreme 
as said in Gita, 14-26: <em>maam 
ca yo avyabhicaareNa bhakti yogena sevate | sa guNaan samatiitya etaan brahma bhuuya kalpate ||</em></p>

<p  class="comment">&#39;And such- / With single, fervent faith adoring 
Me, / Passing beyond the Qualities, conforms / To Brahma, and attains Me!&#39; - Sir Edwin Arnold.</p>

<p class="comment">God Almighty is said to 
be masculine single, the rest of the universe is taken as feminine, as said in Vishnu Puraana:
<em>sa eva vaasudevo ayam saakShaat puruSha ucyate | strii praayam etat sarvam jagat brahma purassaram ||</em> 
Then the way the innate soul, called Seetha, is incarcerated is, when she had no help of the Supreme 
or the Adherent of the Supreme, [Rama and Lakshmana.] Then the Decahedral demon [the demon called Ten 
Motor Senses,] came and captured the Soul, called Seetha and incarcerated that soul in Lanka. The syllable 
&#39;lam&#39; in the word Lanka is <em>lam - biijaakshara</em> which stands for earth, and 
because body is earthly, lascivious and carnal, the soul enters that body by its bondage. If that soul 
again tries for a final release, that soul shall seek the Ultimate as said in the verse of Gita, quoted 
above.</p>

<p  class="comment">There is no instance to quote that Rama or Seetha have performed 
some miracles, special effects or any other optical works... perhaps due to lack of any FX studio or 
something like that, or due to their humanly behaviour. This wizardry is shown by demons and monkeys 
but not by mannish Rama or womanish Seetha. Yet Seetha is held more enigmatic than Rama. If she is not 
an enigma how she footslogged miles and miles in forests without hiring a taxi, and how she came out 
of blazing fire when she performed self-immolation after Great War? These are but two questions among 
many. Because these questions are never-ending and more enigmatic, because we think that we have deciphered 
what Rama is, it is better retain Seetha as an undecipherable enigma.</p>
