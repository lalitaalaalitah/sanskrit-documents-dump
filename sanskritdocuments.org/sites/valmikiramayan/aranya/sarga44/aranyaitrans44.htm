<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 44<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama eliminates Maareecha when he is escaping beyond reach in the form of Golden Deer. He sports with that deer for a long time and
when it is leading him away and afar from the hermitage, he is vexed with the trickery of the deer and kills it. At the time of his death Maareecha
shouts out for Seetha and Lakshmana, as demanded by Ravana. Rama is perplexed at this oddity of Maareecha and presumes that some danger is immanent
and then returns to hermitage.</p>

<p class="comment">Maareecha would have died without yelling for Lakshmana or Seetha as tutored by Ravana because Maareecha is no real alley of
Ravana. But it is said that he 'recollected Ravana's words and thought about it.' What he really thought is the causation of death to that one who
caused his own death, namely Ravana. Ravana can do nothing to Maareecha now as Maareecha is breathing his last. Whatever is to be done now it has t
become a self-ruinous act to Ravana. Hence, it is better to do as said by Ravana for the elimination of Ravana. So thought Maareecha.</p>

<p class="comment">Though Maareecha assumed the form of a deer he has to retain his heart and brain
of a demon. This is the yogic way of <em>para kaaya praveshanam</em> 'entering other bodies.' These
assumed artificial bodies do not hold ground in <em>nidraa, surata, maraNa dasheSu</em> 'in sleep,
copulation and death states,' where the mind, if distracted to these states, cannot concentrate or
hold the body that is assumed by mental powers of yoga. Here no supernal god or deity is involved
to grant such a capacity but one's own practise achieves it. Whereas in other case like Ravana,
gods have bestowed boons, so he need not practise such yoga etc., as he is blessed to be above
these mortal's practises and thus can change his form and can rejoice in any state with that body
or form. This is how he abducts Seetha changing his semblances instantaneously.</p>

Fruits of listening Maareecha&#39;s legend
</p>

<p class="comment">
As with any other demon&#39;s death Maareecha&#39;s 
death also is eulogised as a merited one and reading or listening this is said to bring merit. 
Though these results are not said in Ramayana proper, its collateral scripts like
<em>skaanda purana, aadhyaatma raamaayaNa </em>etc., say them. For the 
elimination of Maareecha <em>aadhyaatma raamaayaNa </em>says:

<p class="smItS">
tat dehaat uddhitam tejaH sarva lokasya pashyataH |<br>
raamam eva aavishat devaaH vismayam paramam jaguH ||<br>
kim karma kR^itvaa kim praaptaH paatakii muni himsakaH |<br>

<p  class="comment">From that body of Maareecha a divine aureole 
risen while all the world is seeing... that merged into Rama alone, causing very great 
astonishment... this is the marvel of Rama, nothing else..&#39; So the divine beings thought seeing from 
heavens, and said &#39;a Brahman or a demon, or a sinner or meritorious one who cites the name of Rama 
at the time of leaving his body, he attains the Ultimate Threshold...&#39; Blessing so, the divine 
beings returned to their abodes on seeing the salvation of Maareecha&#39;s soul in Rama.&#39;
