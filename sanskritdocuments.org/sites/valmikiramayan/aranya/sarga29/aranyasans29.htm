Forest Trek</h3>

<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 29<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Oct 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Khara provokes Rama to fight, but Rama gives enough advise to Khara to yield up. Khara presumes that 
Rama is overtired to fight him back and thus enters into verbal fight. Ultimately Khara hurls a mammoth 
mace at Rama, which burns down all the neighbouring plants and bushes, and Rama splinters it down while 
it is still sky rocketing.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. mahaatejaaH raamaH</em> = great-resplendent, Rama; <em>vi ratham</em> = without chariot [lost 
it]; <em>gadaa paaNim</em> = with mace, in hand; <em>avasthitam</em> = who is staying before; <em>kharam 
tu</em> = to Khara, but; <em>mR^idu puurvam</em> = soft [words,] firstly; <em>paruSam vaakyam abraviit</em> 
= forbidding, sentence, said.</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama, the great-resplendent, spoke these words forbiddingly albeit softly to Khara who lost his chariot 
but staying his course wielding a mace. [3-29-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama is said to have tested whether Khara is ready to surrender or not, at least at this stage of loosing 
all paraphernalia of war. Hence he is said to have talked softly but harshly to that demon.</p>

&quot;One who causes suffering to living beings, besides being a transgressor and completely ruthless, he

<p class="tat">
&quot;All people will eliminate him, oh, nightwalker, who is imperious and an infringer of worldly routine,

<p class="pratipada">
<em>5. lobhaat</em> = by selfishness; <em>kaamaat vaa</em> = obsessively, or; <em>yaH paapaani kurvaaNaH</em> 
= who, evils, while going on doing; <em>na budhyate</em> = will not, know - does not realise - heedless;
<em>such a one; <em>hR^iSTaH</em> = delighted, [bhraSTaH</em> = becomes decadent]; <em>karakaat</em> 
= hail [pellets on eating]; <em>braahmaNii</em> = a lizard [with red tail]; <em>iva</em> = as with;
<em>tasya</em> = what has been done - evil deed; <em>antam pashyati</em> = end [result,] he sees.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;He who goes on performing evils selfishly, obsessively, heedlessly, more so delightedly, he will see 
the results of his own doings, like red-tailed-lizard on its eating self-destructive hailstones, obsessively 
and delightedly. [3-29-5]</p>

<p class="comment">
Hailstones are life-taking poisonous pellets to this particular red- tailed lizard, called <em>brahmaNi</em> 
. It is still called as &#39;bamaani&#39; in Bhojpuri vernacular of Hindi.</p>

<p class="comment">
Parting with some parts of one&#39;s own accrual is <em>lobha</em>, and craving for that which is absolutely 
unavailable is <em>moha</em>. People tend to commit sin while protecting their own accruals as well 
as trying to acquire unavailable things. But any person, if goes on undertaking these evils, even after 
realizing that both are mistakes, it is an unpardonable crime. The metaphor of a red-tail-lizard is 
said to be unavailable in older scripts. There is another variation to this foot wherein the simile 
is with a Brahman bereft of his self-respect, and that foot reads as: <em>bhrSTaH pashyati duHkham sa 
braahmaNa paravaan iva</em> .</p>

<p class="comment">
Next, implying the prospective question of Khara, viz., &#39;What sin I have committed?&#39; Rama answers it 
in the next verse.</p>

वसतो दण्डकारण्ये तापसान् धर्म चारिणः |<br>किम् नु हत्वा महाभागान् फलम् प्राप्स्यसि राक्षस || ३-२९-६</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>6. raakSasa</em> = oh, demon; <em>daNDaka araNye vasataH</em> = in Dandaka, forest, while living 
in; <em>dharma caariNaH</em> = virtue, treaders; <em>mahaa bhaagaan</em> = highly, propitious ones;
<em>taapasaan</em> = sages; <em>hatvaa</em> = on killing; <em>kim nu phalam praapsyasi</em> = why [what], 
really, fruit [benefit,] you will gain.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;The residents of Dandaka forest are the highly-propitious sages that tread the path of virtue, and 
oh, demon, what benefit you gain in killing them, really? [3-29-6]</p>

<p class="comment">
Again Khara may ask, &#39;There are many more sinners, what will become of them, why holding me alone responsible?&#39; 
For this Rama is saying that the sinners in general will get their punishment after their mortality 
when karmic cycle is over. But those that are not only sinners but cruel, and even abhorred by world, 
will ruin here only, because their merit accumulated in earlier births has come to a standstill on this 
earth itself. Those sinners will become like petrified trees trunks, they neither fall nor their boughs 
flower.</p>

<em>shiirNa muulaa drumaaH iva</em> = petrified, base [trunk,] of tree, as with; <em>ciram na tiSThanti</em> 
= long-lastingly, will not, sit tight - will not last long.</p>

&quot;Even if a fortune is made for a lavish living with an iota of merit, the evildoers, that too reprobates, 
further more those that are abominated by world will not last long, no more that petrified tree trunks.

paapasya karmaNaH</em> = of evil, doings; <em>ghoram phalam</em> = ghastly, result; <em>drumaH</em> 
= trees; <em>aartavam</em> = seasonal; <em>puSpam iva</em> = flower, as with; <em>avashyam labhate</em>

<p class="tat">
&quot;One who undertakes evildoings will definitely and seasonably reap their fruits, which in his case will 
be ghoulish, as with the flowering of trees according to season. [3-29-8]</p>

<p class="comment">
dhvani/allusion: That fruit of sin will not be immediate alike the a crop that yields long after sowing. 
Moreover the fruit of sin will be venomous, for the greedy harvester of that sin alone will devour it.</p>

<em>9. kSaNadaacara</em> = oh, nightwalker; <em>loke</em> = in world; <em>paapaanaam karmaNaam phalam</em> 
= of profane, acts, fruit of; <em>bhuktaanaam sa viSaaNaam annaanaam iva</em> = devoured, with, venom, 
food, as with; <em>na ciraat praapyate</em> = not, long after, is acquired.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;In the world one acquires the fruit of profane acts not before long, oh, nightwalker, and it will be 
like venomous food devoured. [3-29-9]</p>

<p class="comment">
dhvani/allusion: &#39;As one quickly acquires the results of the venomous food devoured, oh, nightwalker, 
the perpetrator of profane acts will acquire their fruits that quickly, in the world.&#39; Eating food, 
or committing a sin is simply subjective. If one commits sin unknowingly, that will be as good as the 
intake of venomous food, unsuspectingly. Both the poisonous food, and committing sins will act internally 
and rapidly than any other ruinous inflictor. Then the sinner, or the consumer of poisonous food will 
acquire an inconsolable wretched state.</p>

<em>10. nishaacara</em> = oh nightwalker; <em>ghoram paapam aacarataam</em> = hideous, evil, perpetrators;

&quot;I am the one who arrived at the behest of the king Dasharatha, or Bharata to exterminate the lives 
of those that perpetrate hideous sins, and even of those that wish to do evils to the disapprobation 
of world. [3-29-10]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word &#39;raaj~na&#39; is &#39;sent by some king&#39; for it is in fifth case. Whereas the word &#39;raajaa&#39; is &#39;as a 
king I have come...&#39; This is as appearing in some mms. Dharmaakuutam uses &#39;raaj~naa&#39; and says:
<em>: anena loka 
upadrava karaH raaj~naa avashyam shikShaNiiyam iti suucitam |</em> and he goes on quoting

<p class="tat">
&quot;Now, my arrows that are decorated in gold will be released on you like snakes rebounding from a snake-pit, 
and they will tear you asunder, and on riving you they will bounce back into my quivers. [3-29-11]</p>

<p class="comment">
dhvani/allusion: My arrows can pierce through your body, not only your body but to the core of earth, 
and they bounce back to re-enter my quivers like the snakes that emerge from snake pits and return to 
their pits when their task is over. Or, when these arrows enter your body that is akin to a snake pit, 
they will kill all the sins lying like snakes inside that body of yours, and return to my quivers.</p>

ये त्वया दण्डकारण्ये भक्षिता धर्म चारिणः |<br>तान् अद्य निहतः संख्ये स सैन्यो अनुगमिष्यसि || ३-२९-१२</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>12. tvayaa</em> = by you; <em>daNDakaaraNye</em> = in Dandaka forest; <em>ye</em> = those are;
<em>dharma caariNaH</em> = virtue, treaders - sages; <em>bhakSitaa</em> = are eaten; <em>taan</em> = 
them [the sages]; <em>adya</em> = now; <em>sankhye nihataH</em> = [you] eliminated, in war; <em>sa sainyaH</em>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Now eliminated in war, you along with your army will tread behind those sages that were treading the 
path of virtue, on whom you have so far feasted in Dandaka forest. [3-29-12]</p>

<p class="comment">
<em>dhvani/allusion</em>: A kind of assurance is sounded here by Rama&#39;s words in saying that Khara will be absolved 
of his sins. Those that are eliminated by Rama are sure to get salvation. Here not only Khara but also 
entire army is going to get that salvation, if Khara surrenders at least at this stage. In Skanda Purana 
it is said: <em>raama vidDhaa 
nishaacaraa baaNaiH su taaDitaaH | raamam aasaadya samare saayujya padaviim gataaH || skaanda puraaNa</em> 
But this <em>saayujua</em>, salvation or getting to heavens is of a variety. In war those that sacrifice 
themselves in the fire of arrows will get <em>indra loka</em>. Those that conduct warfare unhappily 
thinking that death is the only result of war they get <em>gandharva loka</em>. Those that retreat or 
go begging for their lives and yet killed, they get <em>guhya loka</em>, and those that are fully aware 
of Kshatriya dharma and conduct righteous warfare they go to <em>brahma loka</em>. So says Maha Bharata. 
The same is said Bhagavad Gita <em>yam yam vaa 
api smaran bhaavam tyajatyante kalebaram | tam tam evaiti kaunteya sadaa tad bhaava bhaavitaH ||</em> 
Gita 8-6.</p>

13. <em>puraa tvayaa ye nihataa</em> = earlier, by you, who are, slain; such of them; <em>paramarSayaH</em> 
= supreme-sages; <em>vimaana sthaa</em> = abiding in aircrafts; <em>adya</em> = now; <em>baaNaiH nihatam</em> 
= with arrows, slain - assaulted; <em>nirayastham</em> = [your] abidance in hell; <em>tvaam pashyantu</em> 
= you, let them see.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Let the supreme sages who were earlier slain by you may now see abiding on their aircrafts, your abidance 
in hellish death pangs when assaulted with my arrows. [3-29-13]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>nirayastham</em> is literally &#39;in hell of Yama&#39; but here it is the hell-like situation 
caused by Rama&#39;s arrows. If the literal meaning of &#39;in hell&#39; is taken the above assurance of salvation 
etc., will be futile, hence, it is &#39;hellish pangs&#39; by the hit of arrows.</p>

<em>14. kula adhama</em> = clan&#39;s, knave of; <em>yathaa kaamam praharasva</em> = as, you wish, you attack;
<em>yatnam kuru</em> = an effort, you make; <em>adya te shiraH</em> = now, your, head; <em>taala phalam

&quot;Attack me as you wish... make an effort... you the knave of your clan... now I am going to toss your 
head down like a palm-fruit...&quot; Thus Rama addressed Khara. [3-29-14]</p>

<p class="comment">
It is questioned whether Rama is self-eulogizing when talking this way to Khara. It is contradicted 
saying that <em>yuddha kaale 
viira vaadasya sva paraakrama anusaareNa utsaaha abhivR^idhyartham para tiraskaara artham ca - aatma 
stuti - karaNe doSha abhaavaat | dk</em> &#39;there is nothing wrong in foretelling how brave a 
warrior is and it will not come under self-praise, in war...&#39; and the commentator goes on quoting many 
references, for e.g., Karna in Maha Bharata says:
<em>shuuraaH 
garjanbti satatam praavR^iShi iva balaahakaaH |</em> &#39;brave ones will be regularly thundering 
like thundering clouds...&#39;</p>

<em>15. raameNa evam uktaH tu</em> = by Rama, thus, [Khara is] said, but; <em>[kharaH] kruddhaH</em> 
= [Khara] is infuriated; <em>samrakta locanaH</em> = with bloodshot, eyes; <em>tataH prahasan</em> = 
thereupon, laughing at; <em>krodha muurchitaH</em> = in anger, convulsed; <em>raamam</em> = to Rama;
<em>prati uvaaca</em> = replied.</p>

<p class="tat">
But when Rama said thus, Khara is infuriated and convulsed in anger, and he replied Rama with bloodshot 
eyes, laughing boisterously. [3-29-15]</p>

<p class="comment">
dhvani/allusion: Khara &#39;laughed at&#39; Rama&#39;s words of self-praise means that even the Supreme Being untiringly 
does some self-praise like telling &#39;I am here to save you... seek refuge in me for I alone can save...&#39; 
in order to make Himself known to the adamants. The whole concept of Bhagavad Gita in telling that &#39;I 
am here... Know me thus...&#39; etc., is for the same purpose. Thus, this is a laughable situation to those 
who are already in the know of Being. Presently it is Khara who was great Vedic Brahman once, but became 
an ogre by curse. Contrariwise, it is a &#39;laughable talk&#39; of the Supreme Being, to non-knowers or for 
the non-adherers.</p>

dhvani/allusion: For this self-praise it is said that Khara estimated Rama as an unworthy being in the 
parlance of mortals. <em>kharaH tu 
kopaat asamartho raama iti bhraantaa uktavaan iti no ko api doShaH | dk</em> But as a cursed 
Vedic Brahman who is in the know of Rama as Vishnu is retorting Rama saying &#39;you also need to self-eulogise, 
when I am fully aware of you and come hither to gain my salvation at your hand? You are not supposed 
to self-extol before small beings like us...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
<em>suvarNa prati ruupeNa tapyatena ashmanaa agninaa</em> is another text. In this <em>ashmanaa</em> 
is &#39;stone...&#39; If anyone touches a stone that is similar to fire outwardly, he does not feel the heat 
of the fire by the cold touch of stone. Thus, his &#39;foolishly mistaken identity&#39; makes a fool of himself. 
Thus Khara is saying &#39;I was thinking that Rama is a very great valiant person, but by way of listening 
your self-eulogies, at an inopportune time, you appear to be a cold stone but not a firebrand... One 
who goes on self-eulogising without taking any action in a war is a coward but not a victor...&#39; Thus 
Khara is quickening Rama to proceed with fighting so that the ensuing salvation can also be quickened.</p>

dhvani/allusion: The mention about Khara&#39;s mace may be noticed. In the text, its reference has come 
more often and at the end it is said to have burnt down the vegetation along its course of travel, which 
indicates that it has some radiation power. Without making it to touch the ground, Rama has splintered 
it in sky itself, and its destruction is metaphoric with a venomous serpent, and hymns and herbs can 
bring down that serpent. That is to say even if venomous missiles are used their antidotes are ready 
at hand. For this Dharmaakuutam says, without expanding:
<em>anena mantra

antidotes, say spells and nostrums...&#39;</p>
