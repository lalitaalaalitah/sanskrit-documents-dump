On one day before the sunrise Rama proceeds to River Godavari for daily bath along with Seetha and Lakshmana. 
On the way looking at the nature around Lakshmana eulogises winter season. In doing so he casts aspersions 
on queen Kaikeyi, and Rama reproves it.</p>

The <em>tilaka</em> is the vermilion mark of <em>sindur</em> , vermilion-red powder specially made out 
of turmeric and limejuice and other ingredients and called as <em>kunkuma</em> . This is sacred and 
used in daily worships and applied as a mark on forehead at a place where the Third Eye, <em>j~naana 
netra</em> is said to exist. For the women this mark is for their glorification of womanhood by virtue 
of the existence of her husband. Should she become a widow this mark is made no more and her face will 
become dullish for she is without a husband. So also the sun is such a mark on the forehead of the woman 
called horizon. Without him no quarters glitter.</p>

watches of night will be quickly slipping away.</p>

<p class="comment">
The three <em>yaamaa</em>-s or <em>praharaH</em>-s, are three hours or three watches, where each <em>
yaama</em>, is three hours. The commentators said that <em>nivR^itta aakaasha shayanaa</em> : precluded 
are troubles to those that are reclining in heavens i.e., divine beings; <em>vR^iddha tara tri yaamaa</em> 
: prolonged are the nightly activities of demons. <em>puSya aaniitaa</em> , where <em>puSya</em> also 
means Kali, the doom, and the demons are brining it up. Thus Lakshmana is said to have reminded Rama 
about the purpose of his incarnation, where the gods are precluded from a restful reclining, the nightly 
activities of demons are on the increase, and the demons are bringing doom time, so Rama has to quicken 
their eradication.</p>

<p class="comment">
The sun now risen is Rama. The word <em>baaSpa</em> also means tears. The fertile lands are shedding 
tears in fear of Ravana. Again <em>baaSpaH</em> is vapour that spreads. Rama&#39;s benevolence is spreading 
like vapour. The forests are with full crops. The lands are full with asceticism and Vedic practices 
to receive the mercy of Rama. The birds&#39; callings are the echoing of Vedic sonority. Govindaraja. The
<em>yava</em> grains are not exactly western barley grains as usually shown in lexicons. It is called 
locally as <em>jov dhaan</em> and is used in fire oblations, . It is a dietary prescription to diabetics 
nowadays.</p>

<p class="comment">
Mantled by darkness and dewdrops dribbling, the leaves and leaflets are crouched and look like sleeping 
ones. Further blanketed by the mist they are appearing as those that are sleeping covering a blanket. 
Flowers are not blooming like the closed eyes of a sleeper. Thus the woodlands are asleep. Govindaraja.</p>

<p class="comment">
For those who are asleep it is a double darkness. One is the darkness of sleep, while the other is the 
darkness of night. They not only crouch in themselves with the inner darkness, but as they are also 
enfolded by the external darkness of night, they further crouch in. Maheshvara Tiirtha. By this sleep 
attribute, the dormant disposition of sages is made evident.</p>

Bharata though staying in kingdom he is observing asceticism following the trend of Rama. By grief Bharata

is a hindrance in getting a glimpse of Rama after return from exile. So Bharata&#39;s refusing the heavens

complete his mission in eradicating the demonic atrocities and quickly return to Ayodhya, lest time 
slips by and Bharata may self-immolate. After these many thoughts, now Lakshmana starts to move the

Extolling seasons in epics</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">The portrayal of seasons in epics with all their delicacies is 
a disputed topic. Ramayana also deals much on these descriptions of seasons. Whether an epic avowed 
to reflect the Vedic import, as said at 1-4-6, <em>vedopabR^ihmaNaarthaaya</em> , and that which is 
pious and merited <em>puNyam vedaischa samamatam</em> at 1-1-98, should have accounts on seasons   is 
the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord 
with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology,
<em>veda-anga : jyotiShya</em> . Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda.
<em>uShaa 
vaa ashvasya medhasya shiraH | sa~Nvatsara aatmaashvasya medhasya | -- yajurveda bR^ihadaaraNyaka</em> 
Hence time and season are the mind and soul of all Veda-s.</p>

<p class="tat">Like this we find beautification of four seasons at four places, 
for e.g., <em>hemanta</em> spring is narrated in starting of Kishkindha. And <em>vasanta</em> post autumnal 
season is described in Kishkindha 43rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and 
after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha. <em>varSa</em> rainy season is portrayed in 28th chapter 
of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do 
explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said:
<em>vedopabR^ihmaNaartham 
pravR^itte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekShita kaala visheSha nirNaayakatvaat kaala saadhaaraNa 
lakShaNa pratipaadanam eva tat tat R^itu varNana vyaajena kR^itam iti dharmopayoga sambhavaat | -- saayam
