<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 31<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">A spy of Ravana named Akampana rushes to him to break the news of annihilation of Janasthaana by Rama. He suggests Ravana to abduct
Seetha. Because parting with Seetha causes grief to Rama and thereby he dies. On thinking for while, Ravana goes to Mareecha seeking his help in
abducting Seetha. Mareecha while explaining Rama's capabilities, reminds us of the incarnations of Vishnu, and advises Ravana to be content with what
he has.</p>

it is the original work or an interpolated one. Some more details are given in the endnote. Akampana's character inevitably has continuity in the war
scene at the end.</p>

countrysides or villages at least, annexing it. If Janasthaana is ruined, Lanka is also going ruin soon, because none can crossover the
bulwark-like-Janasthaana. raajan 'oh, king of demons...' 'when demons in Janasthaana are ruined, your kingship gets ruined...' bahavaH 'many...' 'not

unwarranted occurs. And this fury is a getup to Rama, but it is not his innate nature because <em>ramayate

brute-force <em>vikrameNa a+saadhyaH</em> . Thus he is approachable only in accordance with a set system 
conduct. Further, the word <em>a+saadhya</em> is not coupled with any other sub-words <em>upapada,</em> so he is invincible 
even to Brahma, Rudra, Indra et al. By this Vishnu&#39;s <em>trivikrama</em> incarnation is indicated. He can stop, 
or bifurcate the plethoric river stream just by his intention, leave alone arrows.

yonder blue, hence the firmament has no value for him. <em>siidantii mahiim uddharet</em> Raising the sinking

<p class="comment">Govindaraja says that this Akampana is talking like an enlightened sage, and Maheshvara Tiirtha says that a divine wisdom has
dawned on this spy just now. Then the question that arises is: How a sagacious spy prompted Ravana to abduct Seetha? There are two answers for
this.</p>
<p class="comment">1. Any employee is a half-slave to his master, <em>artha daasaa janaaH sarve </em>as the money paid makes one a slave of the payer. This
spy prompted Ravana in that way because he knows that Ravana is womaniser. Like-king-like-subjects 
<em>yathaa raajaa tathaa prajaaH</em>thus great-demons
think alike. Further Ravana did not ask for the triggering point for the elimination of these many demons. If Ravana questions about it, Akampana had
to say that Ravana's own sister Shuurpanakha wanted to debauch. Then Ravana's rage multiplies and he may even kill Akampana.</p>
<p class="comment">2. All the sages, including Agastya, have declared to Rama that they have planned to bring Rama to Janasthaana only to eliminate
the demons at Janasthaana and going further from Janasthaana to Lanka and eliminating Ravana is Rama's headache. Which happens owing to Seetha.
<em>aaniitaH tvam imam desham upaayena maharShibhiH ||
3-30-35 </em>Thus this sagacious Akampana is plotting to bring Seetha firstly, for whom Rama comes conquering Ravana, and then the demons on
earth will be eradicated. Without Janasthaana Lanka is nothing but an open-door castle. So, the sages paved way for Rama through Janasthaana to
Lanka.</p>

<p class="comment">
This chapter is a scarecrow to the aesthetics of Ramayana and 
a milestone to commentators of Ramayana. We usually find in Ramayana spectacular entrances for cities, 
characters, and situations. Before such a fantastic entrance of Ravana, for which a full sarga/chapter 
is allotted, this chapter is said to be a glaring hurdle. In here, this Akampana is glorified as a sagacious 
person, yet he gives advise to Ravana to abduct Seetha. This advice is said to contain the setting of 
the ultimate war-field in Lanka. But, the weight of the very same advise by Shuurpanakha is lost to 
this of a spy. Shuurpanakha&#39;s intent is very clear, but the meaning, purpose and the achievement of 
this spy is very unclear, except to that which is said by commentators.</p>

<p  class="comment">
Ravana on going to Maareecha, and hearing all indirect puraNa-s 
&#39;mythologies...&#39; returns to Lanka as a gentleman. If he were to be this gentle, Ramayana would not be 
there. But Maheshvara Tiirtha, the commentator says:
<em>ata eva 
raavaNasya siitaa raama bhR^ityatvena taa uddisya tena vakShyamaaNaani baahya dR^iShTyaa durbhaaShaNa 
vat pratiiyamaanaani api vaakyaani - - vastutaH stuti paraaNi eva</em>&nbsp; &#39;Though the utterances 
of Ravana apparently mean as vile, but their subtext is that of a devotee of Vishnu. -- Maheshvara 
Tiirtha</p>

<p class="comment">
If Ravana is a true devotee, basing on many mythologies and sub-mythologies, 
the way in which he treated Seetha in Lanka is evident and it pictures him as a clear-cut villain. Thus 
says another commentator, namely Rama Tilaka, whose aim is to elicit literary values of Ramayana, 
and who dismisses all 
this hyperboling. Whether this chapter is interpolated or original, this is included in traditional versions, and 
hence it is to be sincerely incorporated here, because commentators have said a lot about it. So goes the 
tradition.</p>
