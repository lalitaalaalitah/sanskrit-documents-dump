<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga 42 in prose<br></h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
On travelling by the aircraft like chariot Ravana and Maareecha enter Dandaka forest and arrive at the 
threshold of Rama&#39;s hermitage. Then at the insistence of Ravana Maareecha assumes the form of an amazing 
golden Deer, and Seetha catches a sight of that deer.</p>
<p class="verloc">----</p>

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
Maareecha though curtly said in that way, then afraid of the king of night-walkers he became self-pitying, 
and said to Ravana, &#39;let us go.&#39; </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;If he who wields a bow, arrows and a sword, and who brandishes a weapon to only kill me happens to 
see me again, deem my life is verily lost, without his shooting any arrow. None can really make so bold at Rama to reappear with life, isn&#39;t it. What is appearing before you 
is the reflected image of mine, as I am already slain by the wand of Yama, the Terminator, the moment 
I conceded to your demand. When you are spiteful, oh, boy, indeed what can I possibly do otherwise, oh, night-walker, thither 
I go, may good betide you.&quot; So said Maareecha to Ravana. </p>

<p class="tat">
By that word of Maareecha demon Ravana is very much gladdened and he spoke this sentence tightly hugging 
him. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;This word of yours shows your obduracy for you are abiding under the control of my dictate, and though 
you were a different night-walker earlier, henceforth you are really the good old Maareecha. </p>

<p class="comment">
Some mms use the word <em>shauNDiirya </em>for <em>cChauTirya </em>, where <em>shauNDiirya </em>is the 
word for courageousness, <em>shauNDiirya tyaagii viirayoH : nighanTu</em> The other way to tell this 
is: &quot;Though your words show the fear of my dictate, but on listening those obdurate words, it appears 
that you have spoken them for yourself, regaining the grit of your demon-hood and estimating Rama as 
your own enemy,&quot; by which Ravana is shirking his responsibility to Maareecha himself in the event of 
the death of Maareecha.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then you promptly emplane this sky-flying chariot which is yoked with ghost-faced mules and adorned 
with gems along with me. </p>

<p class="comment">
It may be noted that this sort of air-chariots, though richly decorated with valuable gold and gems, 
but drawn by asses or mules, that too ghost-faced ones, are a kind of the then sci-fi version of aircrafts. 
Ravana&#39;s son Indrajit also uses such spaceships in Yuddha Kanda and his weaponry is altogether different, 
i.e., somewhat like the present day laser oriented hardware. These propellers may not be construed as 
real donkeys or mules but some powered vehicle-drawing instruments designed to look like ordinary harmless 
creatures.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On deluding Vaidehi it is apt of you to go as you please, and I will bring that Seetha of Mithila, 
however defiant it might be.&quot; Thus Ravana said to Maareecha. </p>

<p class="comment">
Ravana is saying repeatedly that Maareecha can go away after beguiling Seetha and misleading Rama and 
Lakshmana away from hermitage. Maareecha knows that there is no place to go away from Rama&#39;s arrow, 
which once chased him up to seashore. But Ravana presumes that if Maareecha is capable enough, he will 
escape Rama, or if this old demon Maareecha is incapable of it, he may perhaps die by the arrow of Rama, 
for which Ravana is unconcerned.</p>

<p class="tat">
Tataka&#39;s son Maareecha said &quot;All right&quot; to Ravana, and then both Ravana and Maareecha mounted the 
chariot as they would emplane an aircraft and swiftly journeyed from the surroundings of Maareecha&#39;s 
hermitage. While looking at the seaports and forests, also at all the mountains and rivers, even at 
the cities and provinces en route they proceeded. On reaching Dandaka forest along with Maareecha 
the king of demons Ravana has then seen the hermitage of Raghava. </p>

<p class="comment">
Please refer to the endnote for the Ancient Indian way of classification of villages, towns, and cities 
as per Indian architecture called <em>vaastu shaastra</em>.</p>

<p class="tat">
Alighting the chariot that is decorated with golden ornaments Ravana then spoke this sentence to 
Maareecha taking his hand into his. &quot;This one which we are seeing and which is surrounded with 
banana plants is the threshold of Rama&#39;s hermitage, and -`----oh, friend, the purpose for which we 
came here let it be effectuated promptly.&quot; Thus Ravana hastened Maareecha. &quot;And on hearing Ravana&#39;s 
words demon Maareecha then became a deer and indeed ambled freely in the frontage of Rama&#39;s 
hermitage. Adopting the form of a gorgeous deer which is superbly amazing just by its appearance, 
whose tips of antlers are in the hue of best sapphires, and whose face is whitish at some places and 
not so whitish at other in its look, he became a Golden Deer and moved thereabout. </p>

<p class="tat">
One of its cheeks in the shade of a reddish-lotus while the other in the hue of a bluish-lotus, one 
of its ears is in the hue of bloomed blue-lotus while the other is in the shade of a sapphire, while 
the shine of its stomach is like that of a best blue-diamond, Indra-niila-maNi, and with a little 
upraised neck that deer has moved about there. </p>

<p class="tat">
One flank is shining whitish like Madhuka flowers and the other is similar to the roseate fibrils of 
lotuses, while its hooves are similar to the gemstone lapis, calves thin, and thus with very well 
cohered limbs that deer moved about there. With an upraised tail that shone forth in a tinge equal 
to the weapon of Indra, namely Rainbow, and with a complexion that is lustrous and dappled with many 
diverse gemlike dapples, that deer moved thereabout with a heart-stealing aura. Thus that demon 
Maareecha emerged like a highly splendorous and fascinating deer in a wink highly irradiating those 
woodlands, and the threshold of Rama&#39;s hermitage in particular. </p>

<p class="tat">
Adopting such an exquisite and heart-stealing form which is amazingly dappled with the colours of 
diverse ores, that demon ambled all over there freely with the bearing of a real deer in order that 
Vaidehi might be deluded, and he moved forward onto the pastures.
And with hundreds of silvery stipples of body he became an astonishing deer with pleasant looks and 
indeed moved chewing new grass-blades of trees. 
That Golden Deer has gone into the boscages of banana plants, and moved here and there around Karnikara 
trees, and then resorted to a place which is within the eyeshot of Seetha. </p>

<p class="tat">
With an odd lotus like hind-side that astounding deer is verily scintillating, and it milled around 
the surroundings in the threshold of Rama&#39;s hermitage according to its own delight. </p>

<p class="tat">
That excellent deer beats a retreat and again returns, and meanders thus time and again, and turns its 
tail for sometime only to return once again very playfully. </p>

<p class="tat">
Again gambolling everywhere it sits somewhere on the ground, then, on coming to the threshold of hermitage 
it goes towards herds of deer. That demon who has gone into the deer-hood has gone after some herd 
of deer. But he returned again though that herd followed him wanting to fraternise, in order that he 
shall remain perceptible to Seetha, and he whirligiged in amusing circles while leaping and bounding 
to and from that herd of deer. </p>

<p class="tat">
All the other animals moving in that forest on seeing this demon-deer with their necks up have come 
close to it, and on smelling it well they are running away to all the ten directions noticing it as 
a demon turned into a deer. </p>

<p class="comment">
Here the animals are portrayed as better beings than humans in identifying demons or ghosts. Though 
they may not know or wish to know about god, the apparent ghost scares them. Humans apperceive neither 
god nor ghost because they are half of each.</p>

<p class="tat">
Even that demon in the deer&#39;s semblance Maareecha, though indulged in killing those forest animals, 
and though the other animals are touching him, he is not killing and eating them indulgently, only 
for the reason of camouflaging his present nature of demon-hood.</p>

<p class="tat">
What is more, Vaidehi with her felicitous eyes came towards trees yearning for plucking the flowers 
in the same instant. And she with her inebriating glances and delightful visage moved there about 
while plucking flowers of Karnikaara, Ashoka, and of Mango trees. That select lady who is unmeet for 
forest life beheld that deer which is completely gemlike and whose limbs are surprising as though 
studded with pearls and gems. And she that Seetha goggled the Golden Deer with a wide-eyed 
astonishment, which deer has pretty lips and teeth, hair resembling silver and copper ores, and she 
indeed gazed at it with an affinity for wildlife. </p>

<p class="tat">
On seeing Rama&#39;s wife Seetha that highly phantasmal deer too then moved there about as though to 
scintillate that woodland.To see such a deer which is hitherto unseen, and which is as though 
studded with numerous gems, the daughter of Janaka, Seetha, went in to an intense wonderment.</p>

<p class="comment">
The stress continuously laid on the eyes of Seetha is observable, only to conclude that <em>&#39;trust not 
what thy eyes show you...&#39;</em></p>

Classification of Villages, Towns, and cities in Ancient India</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
graamaH ca nagaram caiva pattanam kharvaTam puram |<br>kheTakam kusumam caiva shibiram raaja vaasikam 
|<br>senaa mukam iti eva dashadhaa kiirtitam budhaiH ||</p>

<p class="comment">
The <em>vaastu shaastra</em> or the Ancient Indian Architecture lays down certain 
parameters for Towns, cities etc. Of them the township is said to be <em>aneka naarii sambaddham nanaa 
shilpi janaiH vR^itam | kraya vikrayaiH kiirNam sarva devaiH samanvitam nagaram tu iti vikhyaatam</em> 
adored with many ladies, many sculptors or architects, and with many deities, and where the buying and 
selling goes on it is <em>nagaram</em> the township.</p>

<p class="comment">
The Seaports are said as: <em>
pattanam shR^iNu saampratam | dviipaantara gata dravya kraya vikrayikaiH yutam | pattanam tu abdhi tiire 
syaat |</em> one which has all the above aspects but which is at seaside, it is
<em>pattanam</em> seaport. The township between a <em>nagara</em> 
and <em>puram</em> is <em>kharvaTam</em></p>

<p class="comment">And the City is:
<em>
kraya vikrayaiH yutam naanaa jaati samanvitam | tantuvaaya samaayuktam tat puram tu vikathyate</em>The 
one with all the above aspects plus very many civilisations and weavers and the like craftsmen, is
<em>purii</em>, the city. Apart from these, the royal places, army stations etc., 
do comprise the ten varieties of urban places as said in the above verse, where the village is the first 
unit.</p>
