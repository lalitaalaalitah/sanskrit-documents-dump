<p class="txt">
When Rama incinerates Kabandha he resurrects as a celestial being and detailing about Sugreeva he urges 
Rama to befriend him. He informs Rama that Sugreeva is also in a similar condition and he needs some 
one to rely upon, in order to overcome his problems, and thus Kabandha asks Rama to help Sugreeva, and 
get help as requital from Sugreeva.<br></p>

<p class="tat">
When Kabandha said that way, both those brave men and lords of people, on throwing the body of Kabandha 
into a mountain cleft and then embedded it with firewood. On his part Lakshmana started to torch that 
pyre with highly sparkling torches from all over, and even that pyre too suddenly blazed with blazes 
from all over. That massy body of Kabandha is full with fat and while it is being cooked, it is in simile 
with a massy gob of ghee. But the Fire had to stew that body tardily, though that stewed meat is Fire&#39;s 
favourite dish, because of that body&#39;s massiveness.</p>

<p class="tat">
In a trice that highly dynamic Kabandha zoomed up shoving off that pyre, and he is now attired in lily-white 
vestments and angelic garlands, and appeared like a fumeless fire. Then highly gladdened Kabandha jumped 
up onto sky from the pyre, and there he is irradiant with unsullied clothing, and fineries decorated 
on every limb. On going to firmament Kabandha is now seated in a dazzling celestial aircraft yoked with 
swans, which endows renown because it takes the occupants to the realms of Brahma, and sitting in that 
celestial aircraft he said this sentence to Rama, while his own great glimmer and glitter beamed forth 
in all ten quarters.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Raghava, how you will regain Seetha, that you listen from me in its essence... oh, Rama, by which 
and which analyses everything will be analysed, six of such ideations are available in this world... 
and when a person is touched down by a spell of nemeses, he shall adore one who is equally in such spell 
of nemesis...</p>

<p class="comment">
The six ideations employed by kings in kingship are 1] <em>sandhi</em> a covenant with adverse kings; 
2] <em>vigraha</em> continuing hostilities; 3] <em>yaana</em> waging war; 4] <em>aasana</em> sit out 
for proper time; 5] <em>dvaidhii bhaava</em> creating factions and vicissitudes in enemy groups; 6]
<em>samaashraya</em> taking shelter under a coequal.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, you along with Lakshmana went into a spell of nemesis, and thus you have become an underprivileged 
one, and that spell alone has obtained you this dire straits, in the form of abducting your wife... 
Oh, best among kind-hearted ones, thereby you have to certainly befriend such a soul in similar dire 
straits... however deeply I may think, I am not able to perceive your accomplishment if you do not befriended 
with such a soul...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, listen what I tell... a vanara is there by name Sugreeva, who is vengefully reneged by his 
brother Vali, the son of Indra... That self-respectful valiant Sugreeva is living on the Mt. Rishyamuka, 
a best mountain available in the lambent fringes of Pampa Lake, along with four other vanara-s. He that 
Sugreeva is a masterful one among vanara-s, highly mettlesome, self-resplendent, and illimitable is 
his self-radiance... and he is also truth-bound and culture-bound... a mastermind, master-hand and a 
taskmaster... He is a capable adventurer, a courageous exploiter and incomparable one in intrepidity 
and a brave one in incursions, and his personality will be coruscating ever and anon, for he is the 
son of Sun-god... but he is banished by his self-conceited brother owing to the reasons of kingdom...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, he will be your associate and an aid in searching for Seetha, and he conducts himself in 
your wellbeing, hence let not your heart yield to agony... Oh, tigerly Ikshvaaku, further nothing can 
be countermanded in this world which is indeed ineluctable, and it is impossible to countervail against 
Time, isn&#39;t it...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, bold one, you go straight from here to that great mighty Sugreeva, and oh, Raghava, on going from 
here now and promptly you fraternise with Sugreeva... and to not to bode any ill of unfriendliness among 
you two, you make him a friend before blazing Fire, making that Fire as an Attestor of your friendship... 
You shall not look down on that lord of monkeys taking him as a lowly simian, why because that Sugreeva 
is a valiant one, a guise changing wizard and presently he is in the need of a bolsterer, and if you 
render help he will be obligated to you for ever... Now you two are capable enough to effectuate the 
desired task of Sugreeva, isn&#39;t it... whether his own purpose is achieved through you or not, he will 
effectuate your task...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Sugreeva is the son of Riksharaja, and the direct son of the Sun, but Vali trespassed against him. 
Wary of Vali&#39;s onslaughts Sugreeva is wandering around Pampa... Oh, Raghava, right away and candidly 
you make that monkey Sugreeva, a wanderer in the forest, sheltering himself on Mt. Rishyamuka, as a 
friend of yours taking an oath on your weapon besides the Fire-witness...</p>

<p class="comment">
The compound <em>aayudham sam ni dhaaya</em> can mean in the three possible ways as said above. Any 
one, or three meanings can be obtained, as intensifiers.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;With his expertise that straightforward monkey Sugreeva is indeed conversant with all of the strongholds 
of anthropophagite demons in the world in their entirety... Oh, enemy-subjugator Rama, as far as the 
thousand rayed sun manifestly irradiates the world, oh, Raghava, thus far, nothing in the least is unfamiliar 
to him, isn&#39;t it... He makes the monkeys to purposefully rake over the expansive rivers, extensive mountains 
and their impassable cliffs and caves in locating your wife...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Raghava, he expedites giant bodied monkeys in all directions to search for her, who is agonised 
by your parting, and he quests after the residence of Ravana for that comely lady Maithili...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Whether that unreprovable ladylove of yours, Seetha, is located on the tops of Mt. Meru&#39;s peaks, or 
abiding on the planes of nadir of the earth, he that defiant one among fly-jumpers, Sugreeva, on entering 
there and annihilating the demons, he again bestows Seetha to you...&quot; So Kabandha continued his advise 
to Rama regarding Sugreeva.</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
The Suggestion of Kabandha - right or wrong</p>

<p class="comment">
Kabandha&#39;s suggestion that &#39;a bewailer shall befriend another bewailer...&#39; is apparently a meaningless 
suggestion, keeping mythical imports aside, for a while. Though Kabandha is unaware about Ravana and 
his activities, he is aware of Vali and Sugreeva, according to his present narration. He should have 
advised Rama to befriend Vali, who is in power and a powerful one too, instead of Sugreeva. It is not 
so, is the reply from the viewpoint of dharma. This Kabandha has suffered his best in taking wrong routes 
and just now, he resurrected after making many amends, and he is supposed to advise Rama to go on a 
right path and to a right personality as Vali is already established as a pursuer of wrong path. But 
Vali when talking to Rama at his death time says that &#39;I would have brought Maithili in a single day, 
I would have roped Ravana and brought him like an animal tide with roe around its neck...&#39; etc. But 
they are all his expressions at death-time-wisdom. He did not care for Tara&#39;s advices nor bothered to 
talk to Rama, as to why Sugreeva is instigated upon him. This being so, when immortal wisdom has dawned 
on Kabandha, he cannot ask Rama to tread a wrong path to get his task done. This is what the viewpoint 
of Dharmaakuutam. Though untranslated verbatim the above is the gist of the following.</font></p>

<p class="comment">
This is to say that <em>dharma</em> is far beyond mere politics, whether monarchical 
or otherwise. To uphold that <em>dharma</em>, one has to undergo certain painful 
processes, that may be you, or we, or may they be godlike or godsend Rama or Lakshmana.</p>
