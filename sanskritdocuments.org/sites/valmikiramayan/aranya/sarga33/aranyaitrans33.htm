<p class="txt">Shuurpanakha taunts Ravana for his un-kingly activities, by which his kingdom is going to face a calamitous situation soon. While
gibing at him she narrates how a king, really fit for kingship, shall conduct the affairs of kingdom. She speaks many paradigms on which many
commentaries are declined basing on kings and their vices.</p>
<p class="tat">
This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Kishkindha Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. These two chapters, as
detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with <strong>raaja niiti shastra</strong> 'political science' and there in Kishkindha the only rescue
to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas in here Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shuurpanakha.
Though Shuurpanakha is a sultry and harpy demoness, the Sage Valmiki has put some rational words on her tongue in forewarning Ravana.</p>

of kingdom, the king along with his kingdom gets ruined...&#39; because the major issue on hand is Rama 
and Lakshmana and they can ruin Ravana and his kingdom. Inordinate revelling in comforts and lust makes 
a king weak in body, mind, and time. The timely actions he is supposed to take do not come to mind because 
mind is weakened and benumbed. Then he is liable to believe his aids that may precisely land him into 
further troubles. Hence a king / ruler has to take actions and decisions personally, on time, duly remaining 
firm by his body and mind.</p>

"If a king is inaccessible to spies for exchange of information, unavailable for subjects for an audience for a similar appraisal,
more so if he is intemperately not able to impose self-discipline, people will eschew such a king from a distance as elephants will refrain

<p class="comment">Shuurpanakha knows that Ravana has spies all around, but she is also in the know that they are worthless fellows because they
narrate mythologies after every thing is ruined, as was done by Akampana in the previous episode. There is none to caution him beforehand excepting
herself, that is her confidence. So, she is haranguing Ravana to take immediate action, otherwise, there may be a mutiny or cold war in his kingdom,
and his subjects may desert him during wartime, like Vibheeshana.</p>

"Without keeping the kingdom under your personal control, you have shuffled the administration onto the ministers and army personnel
like Khara, Duushana et al. And these figureheads alone become the tiderips, for they quarrel among themselves about the kingship of Lanka after your
ruin, and they alone are floating like oceanic tides up above your head and thus you are a submerged sovereign. In any way, your doom is destined
either by Rama, who is an imminent danger, or by your military managers, who are the in-built dangers."</p>
<p class="comment">Ravana is no doubt mountainous in his wealth and prosperity but he is engulfed in the ocean called promiscuity, and as long as
those waters of lust tiderip over his head he cannot surface himself.</p>

<p class="comment">Your enmity with the sensible gods will make them sensitive to be vigilant. And because there is a lack of intelligence or agents
to you, added to it there is a lack of your own personal intelligence required for a king, and above all there is a lacking in the insistence of real
kingship with you. Then, will not those gods take opportunity to hit you back, for everything is lacking in you, except lusting?'</p>

"You are the humiliator of others, you hobnob only with your ravishes, and incognisant of the object for apportionment of time and
place for your activities, as to when and where and how the things are to be dealt with. And, as you are not attending any kingly activity, or do not
focus your mind in deciding rights and wrongs, thereby your kingdom will get ruined and you will be imperilled, not before long." Thus Shuurpanakha
declaimed Ravana about his worthlessness as a king. [3-33-23]</p>
<p class="comment">However self-sufficient and self-assured a king might be, he cannot underestimate rivalling kings as 
trivial, unilaterally.<em> anena susamR^iddha raajyastho api raajaa etaiH doSaiH aciraat raajya

dk</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is indicated that a king should 
be on his guard lest he will be overthrown, just because that king is associated with many un-kingly 
attitudes.</p>
