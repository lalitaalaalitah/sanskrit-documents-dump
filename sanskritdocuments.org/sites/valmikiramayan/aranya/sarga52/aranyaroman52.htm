<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 52<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Seetha is abducted by Ravana. When they are on their way to Lanka the whole nature along with its inhabitants 
laments for the atrocious abduction of Seetha. In here, almost every verse is elaborated, for they contain 
poetic niceties, and hence more stuffing in introduction is unbefitting.</p>

sā tu tārā adhipa mukhī rāvaṇena nirīkṣya tam |<br>gṛdhra rājam vinihatam vilalāpa suduḥkhitā || 3-52-1</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. taaraa adhipa mukhii</em> = stars&#39;, lord, visaged - Seetha; <em>saa tu</em> = she, on her part;
<em>raavaNena vinihatam</em> = by Ravana, [nearly] killed; <em>tam gR^idhra raajam niriikSya</em> = 
at him, eagles, king of, on gazing at; <em>su duHkhitaa</em> = highly anguished; <em>vilalaapa</em> 
= wept away.</p>

<p class="tat">
Seetha whose visage is like a full moon wept on gazing the king of eagles Jataayu whom Ravana nearly 
killed. [3-52-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
There occurs another verse before this one in Eastern recension which says that Ravana has firstly seen 
Jataayu who is spinning on earth to breath his last: <em>
tam alpa 
jiivitam gR^idhram sphurantam raakSha adipa | dadarsha bhuumau patitam samipe raaghava aashramaat ||</em>thereby 
giving some time to Seetha to recollect what has happened.</p>

nimittam lakṣaṇam svapnam śakuni svara darśanam |<br>avaśyam sukha duḥkheṣu narāṇām paridṛśyate || 3-52-2</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>2. lakSaNam</em> = characteristics - of omens; <em>svapnam</em> = [concomitants of] dreams; <em>
shakuni</em> = presages [shakuna] svara darshanam = [of birds,] callings&#39;, seeing [cognisance]; <em>
naraaNaam</em> = of humans; <em>sukha duHkheSu</em> = in ecstasy, in agony; <em>avashyam</em> = definitely;
<em>nimittam</em> = conjecturable; <em>pari dR^ishyate</em> = in general, are being seen [perceived.]</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Humans definitely perceive either agony or ecstasy by its concomitant happenings, or by the characteristics 
of uncommon reflexes of their own body parts, or by the presages, or by conjecturable concomitants, 
or by cognising calls of birds. [3-52-2]</p>

<p class="comment">
Vividly: Seetha&#39;s plaint is like this: &#39;Oh, Rama, we humans do perceive good or bad happenings by the 
presages, like concomitant happenings of some hindrances when a deed is attempted, like unforeseen tidings 
like sneezing, a minor accident or a misfire, or unable to catch a sight of one&#39;s own face in a mirror... 
or by the undue reflexes of bodily parts, like flutter of eyelids or shudder of shoulders or arms... 
or by the callings of birds and movements of animals... so, by now your left shoulder and left eye should 
have shuddered, or some crows might have cawed uglily, or some birds might have gone from your right 
to left, except <em>garuDa, bharadwaja</em> birds, and by these forebodings why do not you cognise that something 
is happening to me and thus why not come to my rescue?&#39;</p>

= big, catastrophe; <em>na jaanaasi</em> = not, able to know; <em>nuunam</em> = for sure; <em>mat artham</em> 
= for my, sake; <em>mR^iga pakSiNaH</em> = animals, birds; <em>kaakutstha [kaakutstham]</em> = oh, Kakutstha, 
[or, towards Kakutstha]; <em>dhaavanti nuunam</em> = running, for sure.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, for sure you are not able to know about big catastrophe called my kidnap is chancing on you, 
even though oh, Kakutstha, these animals and birds are running towards you surely for my sake, to tell 
about me. [3-52-3]</p>

<p class="comment">
bhaava/import: &#39;Oh, Rama you may not be able to perceive the prognostications as you are in a fit of 
hunting that Golden Deer, but, for a while keep that hunting at bay and give an ear to these birds and 
animals that are rushing towards you to convey the news of my kidnap... and for god&#39;s sake do not kill 
these animals, presuming that they are pestering you...</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>4. raama</em> = oh, Rama; <em>maam traatum</em> = me, to save; <em>kR^ipayaa</em> = mercifully;
<em>iha sangataH</em> = here, arrived [or, encountered Ravana]; <em>ayam vihan gamaH</em> = this, sky, 
flier [eagle Jataayu]; <em>mama a bhaagyaat</em> = by my, ill, luck; <em>vinihataH</em> = verily mangled;
<em>bhuumau shete hi</em> = on earth, sprawling, indeed.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, this sky flier Jataayu who mercifully came here to save me is verily mangled on his encountering 
Ravana, and he is sprawling on earth, indeed by my ill luck.&quot; Thus Seetha wailed. [3-52-4]</p>

<p class="comment">
bhaava/import: &#39;My ill luck is so preponderant, in that it has demolished this Jataayu, who by himself 
is a pious and merited being who came to help the helpless one like me... but my ill luck pervaded over 
such an impeccable being also... otherwise Jataayu would have vanquished Ravana... thus, when an immeasurable 
ill luck is holding sway, it is for you, and you alone, oh, Rama, to come for my rescue...&#39;</p>

trāhi mām adya kākutstha lakṣmaṇa iti varāṃganā |<br>su saṃtrastā samākraṃdat śṛṇvatām tu yathā antike

<p class="pratipada">
<em>5. vara anganaa</em> = best, lady; <em>su sam trastaa</em> = very, highly, panicked; <em>kaakutstha 
lakSmaNa</em> = oh, Kakutstha Rama, oh, Lakshmana; <em>adya maam traahi</em> = now, me, liberate;
<em>iti</em> = thus; <em>antike shR^iNvataam yathaa</em> = close by [afore,] listeners [addressees,] 
[are available] as though; <em>sam aakrandat</em> = noisily, bawled.</p>

<p class="tat">
That best lady who is very highly panicked bawled noisily, &quot;oh, Rama of Kakutstha... oh, Lakshmana... 
liberate me now...&quot; as though the addressees are before her. [3-52-5]</p>

<p class="comment">
bhaava/import: A subject&#39;s bawling in the audience of a king is different from that of a cry of a subject 
in a moor. Here Seetha is visualising those two Kakutstha-s, Rama, and Lakshmana, right in her front, 
in a halo, and suppliantly bawling, as though asking them to come out that halo to help her out. Her 
bawling is not in a clamorous tone but it is a<em>roshantiim madhura svaraam</em> &#39;crying with mellowly voice...&#39; 
as detailed at verse 42 below, for there should be difference between the braying of an ass and parroting 
of a parrot.</p>

<em>7, 8. antaka sannibhaH</em> = Death, one similar in shine; <em>raakSasa adhipaH</em> = demons&#39;, 
lord; <em>lataam iva mahaadrumaan veSTantiim aalingantiim</em> = climber plant, like, to sturdy tree, 
who is muffling, and clinging; <em>vane raameNa rahitaam</em> = in timberland, by Rama, one who is devoid 
of; <em>raama raama iti</em> = Rama, Rama, thus; <em>kroshantiim</em> = who is bewailing; <em>taam</em>

end of [self-ruinously]; <em>kesheSu jagraaha</em> = at head-hair [bun of hair,] clutched her.</p>

<p class="tat">
Ravana, the lord of demons, has repeatedly and harshly taunted Seetha saying, &#39;leave it off, leave it 
off...&#39; when Seetha devoid of Rama in that timberland is clinging and muffling a sturdy tree like a 
climber plant, and bawling, &#39;Rama, Rama,&#39; and that demon whose shine is similar to the Death has clutched 
her hair loosened from her bun, as death loomed large on him. [3-52-7, 8]</p>

<p class="comment">
bhaava/import: Here the word <em>vane</em> &#39;in timberland...&#39; is actually &#39;loneliness...&#39; plus, &#39;minus Rama...&#39; 
and her crying is <em>araNya rodana</em> &#39;a cry in wilderness...&#39; And from the viewpoint of Ravana, she is uttering 
a wild cry indicating that &#39;the giant tree called Ravana is going to fall...&#39; as with the woodcutters&#39; 
yelling &#39;timber... timber...&#39; as a warning cry that a tree is about to fall, when the word &#39;timber&#39; 
is used esp. as intransitive. This catching a chaste woman by her hair is the worst possible crime and 
sin as explained at 3-50-13 of this chapter. And now all the gods feel satisfied for the commencement 
of the process for elimination of vice on earth, called Ravana, though pitying Seetha.</p>

<p class="comment">
Here, the &#39;capturing Seetha by her shadow&#39; as explained by Maheshvara Tiirtha, is an untouched subject. 
If she can be captured by shadow while she is in her senses and agitating and clinging a sturdy tree, 
as with Simhika-Hanuma in Sundara Kanda, Ravana should not have given her this much time to bemoan, 
but should have captured by her shadow without leaving her to pay a visit to dying Jataayu. Hence, this 
capture is viewed on a human plane, rather than a conjuror&#39;s trick.</p>

<em>9, 10a. vaidehyaam</em> = of Vaidehi; <em>pradharSitaayaam</em> = while being insulted; <em>sa caraa 
a caram</em> = together with, mobile, not mobile [sessile]; <em>sarvam jagat</em> = entire, world;
<em>a maryaadam</em> = not, scrupulous [chaotic]; <em>andhena tamasaa samvR^itam babhuuva</em> = by 
blinding, blackness, blanketing, it became [bechanced]; <em>tatra maarutaH na vaati</em> = there, wind, 
not, wafts; <em>divaakaraH niS prabhaH abhuut</em> = day maker [Sun,] devoid of, shine, became.</p>

<p class="tat">
While Vaidehi is insulted thus, entire world together with its mobile or sessile beings became chaotic, 
and there chanced a blanketing of a blinding blackness, and waft-less is the Wind and shine-less is 
the Sun. [3-52-9]</p>

<p class="comment">
This &#39;blackness&#39; is a poetic gloominess of the mood, rather than a material or mythical, or superimposing 
darkness. Sun is gloomy, wind is gloomy, and the entire nature is in oblivion of sadness.</p>

On seeing Seetha&#39;s appropriation by an inappropriate being with His clairvoyant eyes, the illustrious 
Grandparent of Universe Brahma declared, &quot;the deed is done...&quot; but all of the supreme sages in Brahma&#39;s 
abode on seeing Seetha in such a condition became despondent, and yet delighted in foreseeing results. 
[3-52-10b, 11a]</p>

<p class="comment">
Usually this expression <em>parama R^iSaya</em> &#39;quintessential sages...&#39; is linked with the words
<em>danDakaraNya</em> in next verse and said that &#39;the sages dwelling in Dandaka forest are delighted 
and yet, despondent...&#39; If some elderly sages were available in the vicinity, they would have waited 
until the arrival of Rama and would have informed Rama of Seetha&#39;s abduction, though they may not be 
able to combat Ravana or hurl a curse at Ravana. But Ravana is no fool to abduct Seetha while a bystander 
stands over looking on the spectacle. Hence, these sages said here are those that are available in the 
academy of Brahma. And the <em>danDaraNya vaasinaH</em> in the next foot are the voiceless and incommunicable 
beings in Dandaka forest.</p>

<p class="comment">
Again a poetic &#39;thinking&#39; that even speechless beings can presage and prognosticate. Though they may 
not tell us directly, their body language and odd behaviour will certainly tell. The behaviour of animals 
and birds before an earthquake or a storm or any natural devastation is not an unknown phenomena. After 
all, a frog crocks before a rain.</p>

coloured body which is muffled up with jewellery of pure gold, and added with a golden coloured ocherish 
silky dress, while traversing in the sky. [3-52-14]</p>

<p class="comment">
dhvani/innuendo: A lightening in a cloud does not last for a long period. So also, for being with this 
cloudlike Ravana, these flashes of lightning, called Seetha, will not last long, albeit those flashes 
alone will electrocute that cloud, called Ravana.</p>

uddhūtena ca vastreṇa tasyāḥ pītena rāvaṇaḥ |<br>adhikam paribabhrāja giriḥ dīpa iva agninā || 3-52-15</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>15. tasyaaH</em> = of her; <em>uddhuutena piitena ca vastreNa</em> = by upheaved, yellowish [ochreish 
silken sari, rather, blazing hue of silk sari,] also, by cloth [upper fringe of sari]; <em>raavaNaH</em> 
= Ravana; <em>agninaa diipa giriH iva</em> = by fire, blazing, mountain, like; <em>adhikam pari babhraaja</em> 
= muchly, overly, shone forth - ablaze.</p>

<p class="tat">
When her ochreish silk sari&#39;s upper fringe is upheaved by air onto to Ravana, Ravana looked blazing 
like a mountain set ablaze, muchly and overly. [3-52-15]</p>

<p class="comment">
dhvani/innuendo: If some parts of a mountain are afire it is no problem since it is usual. But when 
the mountain itself is overly and muchly aflame, it is impracticable for any to prevent it or help it 
out. The upper cloth of Seetha&#39;s sari is goldenly silky and thus it will have a tinge of reddish brown 
hue, like the outer edge of the tongue of fire. That fringe <em>pallu</em> is upheaved, [intr.] rise and fall 
rhythmically or spasmodically, by air and it is flagging off the annihilation of Ravana, by its flag-like 
motions on his face. Thus, Ravana who is standing like a mountain as of now is destined soon to become 
a mountain with a self-ruinous fire, overly and muchly.</p>

<em>padma patraaNi</em> = lotus, petals [so far decorating her bun]; <em>cyutaani</em> = slithered;

lotus, petals, of Vaidehi; <em>abhyakiiryanta raavaNam</em> = around, strewn - by air.]</p>

<p class="tat">
Reddish and scented lotus-petals adorning that highly auspicious Seetha have slithered, but again upheaved 
by air they are bestrewn on Ravana. [3-52-16]</p>

<p class="comment">
dhvani/innuendo: The reddish lotus petals which hitherto are on her body, as garlands and on her braid 
as a chaplet, are crumpled and loosened in the tussle and thus each petal is falling each time. Instead 
of falling onto earth, they are upheaved and sprinkled on Ravana&#39;s body by the fast wind under the feet 
of Ravana, somewhat like a floral welcome. This is in one way a good omen to Ravana to get a release 
from his accursed state, while on the other, it suggests that his opulence is soon destined to wither 
away like a withered petal of lotus. The last foot is taken, which obtains in other mms, leaving off 
the middle foot, that also says the same.</p>

born [like lotus minus stalk]; <em>na raraaja</em> = not, brightened.</p>

As with a stalk-less lotus the immaculate visage of Seetha is unbright in the sky when she is on the 
flank of Ravana as Rama is not in vicinage. [3-52-18]</p>

<p class="comment">
bhaava/import: A lotus without a stalk looses its glamour as well as its infrastructure. As sun brightens 
the face of moon, Rama brightens Seetha&#39;s visage. As moon depends on sun, Seetha depends on Rama, and 
devoid of him, she is lost to the world for a glimpse.</p>

The gemstone sapphire, more precisely <em>indra niila maNi</em>, shines brilliantly when studded in

of Tiirtha is found more emphatic, but the blemish of reiteration occurs to the epic, because

to set his home afire. Perhaps Ravana might have thought in similar way and thus kept Seetha in Ashoka 
gardens, instead of placing her in his golden palace, so that his golden palace will not be burnt with 
this torch, called Seetha. But the same torch burns that golden palace down to ashes, though not directly

The mountains appeared bewailing with their waterfalls as shedding tears and with their peaks as upraised

<p class="comment">
dhvani/innuendo:A mountain cannot fly up to confront Ravana like an eagle, nor it can express its anguish 
like a swaying tree or a chirping bird, nor it cannot doggedly run after like lions and other animals, 
thus it is a &#39;cannot but situation&#39; for any mountain to sit back and weep, as it is sessile. The eyes 
do not shed tears only in one direction. So also, the waterfalls are shed in many directions at the 
face-level of mountains, but not from their peaks. Then how to express their anguish bodily, to her 
who is up above the sky or pray the Almighty to rescue her? Hence, their raised mountaintops are their 
upraised arms, expressing all of their anguish, more so, with the booming weepy noise of the air coming 
out their caves, which in normal situations will be like the booming voicing of Sama Veda.</p>

someday some seducer like Ravana may also lead them astray, as collapsed is the equilibrium of conscience,

The sense and nonsense of the &#39;untouchability&#39; of woman</p>

<p class="comment">
There are many taboos annexed to woman saying that &#39;a woman is untouchable by other men...&#39; and much 
discussion is also there in Ramayana. For this, the commentator of Dharmaakuutam says, that when Seetha 
herself said to Hanuma that touching other men is indecent in Sundara Kanda, Ch. 37, at verses 60 or 
so: bhartur bhaktim puraskrtya raamaat anyasya vaanara | na aham spraShTum padaa gaatram iccheyam

<p class="comment">
&#39;advances towards a woman with a libidinous look, or a voluptuous gesticulation 
or lustful approaches are &#39;immoral&#39; but mere touching or embracing age-old people, people in anguish 
etc, is as good as fondling her own babies...&#39; Again according to gautama suutraa-s 
&#39;lustful eying, or teasingly hankering after other&#39;s women is to be avoided...&#39; </p>

<p class="comment">
Even the
mitraakshara &#39;A treatise of Friendlily Advises&#39; says: &#39;seeing voyeuristically, 
bodily gesticulations, habitual observations, or hankering after lustfully etc., are immoral for a man 
of age at any woman...&#39; This is discussed for the act of Seetha in hugging Jataayu at last verse of 
previous chapter of this Aranya Kanda: punaH ca samgR^ihya ruroda &#39;again 
taken into hands, wept away...&#39; Some publications of this Gorakhpur version has this word
samgR^ihya a word of less intensity, &#39;taken into hands...&#39; has a replacement
parishvajya, aali.ngya the words with clear-cut action, &#39;embraced, hugged 
a dying eagle with a fatherly affection. Therefore it does not mean women are &#39;untouchables&#39; in general.</p>

<p class="comment">From Ravana&#39;s side his curse is that, &#39;his head splinters into 
thousands of pieces if he touches other&#39;s woman...&#39; But it is not yet splintered though he handled Seetha 
that roughly. Hence, that curse in its actuality is &#39;raping&#39; but not mere &#39;touching&#39; of body parts. 
Touching the &#39;untouchable&#39; parts of other&#39;s women, that too without proper and full consent of that 
woman. As such, though he touched Seetha, carried on his flanks, took to his Lanka on his own body, 
he gives her time to reconcile herself, but does not make haphazard advances unilaterally. Thus, a difference 
between touching and fondling, grasping and caressing is established and it is no sin or taboo for any 
woman to do so.</p>
