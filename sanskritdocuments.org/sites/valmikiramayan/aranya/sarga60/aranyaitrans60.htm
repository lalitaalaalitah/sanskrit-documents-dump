<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 60<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama laments for Seetha&#39;s separation. He starts searching for her and goes on asking every plant, tree 
and animal, in a kind of frenzied attitude. This chapter is too poetic to summarise, hence this much 
is said here.</p>

<p class="tat">
The trees of that woodland are seemingly weeping, as their flowers are witheringly weakening and their 
birds are weepingly warbling, and the animals are whingeingly weeping, and that woodland is charmless 
and utterly shattered, since its georgic deities have completely abandoned it. Rather utterly bestrewn 
are the deerskins and sacred grass blades, rather utterly battered are the tender-grass-seats and other 
mats in the compound of cottage, and he who ardently wanted to see Seetha, such a Rama, on seeing such 
an emptied locale and cottage, wept over, over and again. [3-60-6, 7]</p>

<p class="comment">
By this bestrewn, battered, or shattered state of articles, it is evident that Seetha struggled a lot 
to get release from the clutches of Ravana, and in their tussle articles are in shambles. Hence, Ravana 
did not carry Seetha on a clod of earth as said in Adhyaatma Ramayana and other texts. Valmiki&#39;s Seetha 
is an out and out human, as of now.</p>

Though he searched effortfully for his dear Seetha he did not get her, and as his anguish is reddening 
his eyes the appearance of that glorious one seems to be that of a madman. [3-60-10]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word iva &#39;as though, seems to be, alike...&#39; has some importance from the viewpoint of commentators, 
and some discussion is given in endnote on its usage. Because he is &#39;like&#39; a madman, the translation 
shall also be &#39;like&#39; a mad-translation, as long as he talks &#39;like&#39; a madman.</p>

Rama ran speedily from tree to shrub, from hill to hillock, from river to rivulet, and revolving around 
them he wailed for Seetha, as he is inundated in a sludgy ocean of woes. [3-60-11]</p>

<p class="comment">
Whether Rama &#39;really wept&#39; over Seetha&#39;s absence or it the &#39;playacting&#39; of god - is a much-debated topic. 
As a hero of the epic, it is &#39;real&#39; weeping and it is necessary to arouse pathos, but should he be god 
or god incarnate, is &#39;weeping&#39; manifest in the qualities of Omniscient - is the dilemma. Some points 
are presented in the endnote.</p>

Did Rama actually weep?</p>

<p class="comment">Maheshvara Tiirtha says that, &#39;the word <em>
iva</em> &#39;alike, seemingly, as though&#39; is to be ellipted to all the expressions given by Rama, as 
god incarnate Rama did not &#39;really&#39; weep over...&#39; As such the expressions will become:
<em>shokaat paripluta iva, shokaat pradhaavan iva, vilapan iva</em> etc., and they 
mean &#39;as though he is inundated in sea called lamentation... as though he wept... as though he ran after...&#39; 
and the like. For this the <em>viSNu puraaNa, umaa samhita</em> is cited as reference, 
where Vishnu himself says: <em>aham 
daasharathiH buutvaa hanmi raavaNam aahave | shrii mad raama avataare asmin aj~navat kriyate mama | tatra 
shankaa na kartavyaa sarvaj~nena api maayayaa | mat maayaa mohitam rakSho manuShyam maam avekShyati | 
anyathaa tasya saa nuunam na bhavet atra kutracit</em> &#39;I on becoming Dasharatha&#39;s son 
will eliminate Ravana in combat... though Omniscient I conduct myself in the incarnation of Rama as 
a commoner by my Maya... thereby no doubt be nurtured by any... believing me a human Ravana will be 
mislead, as there is no other way for his elimination...&#39; thus Tiirtha says that Rama did not actually 
&#39;weep or wail...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">But this is contradicted and said by later commentators, &#39;though 
Rama is Supreme Being he took up human incarnation and he conducted himself as a human. Hence there 
is no need to ellipt ellipses for many a time and portray him as a &#39;direct&#39; god on earth. Valmiki has 
said this more than once through Rama&#39;s words that he is just a &#39;human...&#39; <em>aatmaanam 
aham maanuSam manye</em> &#39;I for myself am a human...&#39; etc., and here also Valmiki used this word
<em>iva</em> only at a few places like <em>unmatta iva, udbhraanta 
iva</em> Even if Rama were to be &#39;god&#39; on earth, for his fate of taking a human incarnation he is 
fated to behave as a human, and gets involved in human emotions, according to situations and his mental 
conditions. In such conditions, for he is &#39;god&#39; he can &#39;evoke&#39; an emotion as he evoked rancour many 
times when eliminating demons as in the episodes of Aranya when he was eliminating Khara, Dushana, and 
others. There is <em>roSam aahaarayat tiivram...</em> &#39;rancour, evoking, unusual...&#39; 
&#39;and then evoking an unusual rancour to eliminate Khara in war, he eliminated Khara...&#39; as at 3-30-19. 
Here when the word <em>roSam</em> is replaced with <em>shokam</em> 
and if it be said as <em>shokam aaharayet tiivram...</em> it suffices all contradictions. 
And in many other places, we see him <em>aaharayet</em> &#39;getting&#39; wrath or sadness, 
or other humanly emotion. When he can &#39;evoke&#39; one human emotion &#39;wrath&#39;, why not evoke other emotions 
like &#39;love, sadness, pity, kindness&#39; and the like. Again, there are some subhuman emotions like greed, 
avarice, hate, jealousy etc., which are unbefitting to humans themselves, hence the question of Rama&#39;s 
evoking them for his activities, does not arise.</p>

<p class="comment">Then &#39;is this playacting of god, of hoodwinking of man called 
Rama in the name of Ravana...&#39; is the connective question. The answer is &#39;neither...&#39; for it is maya 
of Vishnu. In other way, it is not hoodwinking of Rama but it is the bewailing of god/Rama caused by 
the suffering of his adherents/devotee/subjects - particularly for Seetha, who is not just a devotee 
or adherer, but his own altar ego. Particularly when that god alone, through the so-called destiny, 
karma, fate etc, causes that suffering. Rama admits at verse 34 of this chapter &#39;this is as though I 
have forsaken this Seetha...&#39; because of his passion for hunting, either the deer or the demon, thus 
bechanced is an ill fate on Seetha.</p>

<p class="comment">If Rama were to be god, he is not an &#39;featureless&#39; god of
<em>advaita</em> tenet, a <em>nirguNa</em> but he is
<em>saguNa</em> &#39;featured&#39; god and some of his many features are:
<em>svabhaavika anavadhika atishaya, j~naana, bala, aishvarya, viirya, shakti, tejaH, 
saushiilya, maardava, aarjava, sauhaardra, saumya, kaaruNya, maadhuryam, gaambhiirya, audaaryaadi aneka 
kalyaaNa guNa sampanna...</em> of which we are concerned with <em>kaaruNya, maardava</em> 
features, &#39;pity and sheltering...&#39; as Shudarshanaacaarya defined <em>maardavam</em> 
as <em>aashrita viraha a-sahatvam maardavam</em> &#39;impatience for the separation 
from his adherers...&#39; and Rama wept with this pity and impatience for Seetha&#39;s separation from him.</p>

<p class="comment">However delinquent the children be, they do not know or care to 
know what their parents feel about their delinquency, because they themselves are thinking that they 
are not at all delinquent. But their parents, though they are aware of their children&#39;s delinquency, 
but unable to mend them, they suffer silently or blatantly. Here too it is the same predicament for 
Rama, though it is not parent-child relation, but it is man-wife relation, worthier enough for more 
suffering. His anguish is for the &#39;soul&#39; called Seetha, going to be captivated in the &#39;body&#39; called 
Lanka, and her deliverance is possible only on the annihilation of that body or holder of that body, 
namely Ravana, in the karmic cycle of birth-death. And none has a real glimpse or knowledge of that 
god or soul, but all go on assuming on their own as Bhagavad Gita says at7-24:</p>

<p class="comment">&nbsp;<em>avyaktam 
vyaktim aapannam manyate maam a-buddhaya | param bhaavam ajaananto mama avyayam anuttamam | gita</em></p>

<p class="comment">&nbsp;<em>Which deem th&#39; Unmanifested manifest, / Not comprehending Me in my true Self! 
/ Imperishable, viewless, undeclared,</em> - Sir Edwin Arnold. Hence, Rama really wept for Seetha 
and in fact, gods really weep even for us, madly and sadly, but we do not care, or wish to care.</p>
