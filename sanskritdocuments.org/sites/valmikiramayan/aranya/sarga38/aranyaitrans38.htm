<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 38<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Maareecha continues his good word to Ravana and he dissuades him from abducting Seetha. His advice is that the dalliance with other's
wives is the greatest sin, more so, with Rama's wife as Rama's valour is irrefutable. Maareecha narrates how Rama hurt him while safeguarding
Vishwamitra's Vedic-ritual, when Rama was still a young boy.</p>

"At that time, yet unborn are the identities of adulthood like moustache on his face, and that providential one was magnificent in

Dandaka forest with a radiating radiance of his own, and then he appeared like the just risen baby-moon. [3-38-14, 15]</p>
<p class="comment">The identities of adulthood are the discardable things like moustaches, beard, etc. These are natural to humans or to birthed
beings. But the mythological entities do not have them. As a young scholar, the boys are supposed to wear simply, hence 'one-piece-clothing' is said
to be the dress of Rama. This suggests that he is not wearing any shield or armour to keep him safe. In Bala Kanda, at the outset of the journey of
Rama and Lakshmana with Vishvamitra, it is said that they are wearing finger-covers made of certain lizard skin, which means to say that their
fingers are very tender in using arrows. His mothers delicately arranged the locks of hair, because he is still 'boyish' to her. More so, he is with
a 'boyish' ornament, say a single pendant, not verily embellished with princely jewellery. He appeared like some providential 'boy' hitherto unseen,
with the height of a peacock, with the complexion of peacock-neck-blue, and moving about like a noble peacock. This boyish-Rama peacock is not
screaming, yet his bow is twanging; leave alone the screeching and screaming.</p>
<p class="comment">The 'new-moon' metaphor to Rama suggests that he has only waxing and no waning
in him, <em>uttarottara abhivR^iddhi</em> and also that he is by birth an antagonist of <em>tamas</em> 'the
darkness,' or darkish activities, like the moon whose activity is only to illumine the night.
Further, he has a likeable persona to any, even to the present demon Maareecha, and even to Ravana.
When Ravana sees Rama for the first time in war, Ravana praisefully acknowledges Rama's
personality. Besides, Rama's gleam is like that of a baby-moon, against the backdrop of a thickish,
darkish, blackish sky, called the forest.</p>

<p class="comment">The golden ear-knobs on the lobes of ears are either indicative of the knowledge one possess or the wealth factor. Maareecha
refers to these ear ornaments more than once suggesting that 'wealth or wisdom is nothing to Rama, but righteousness alone will work out.' Because
Ravana did not give an ear for the suggestions of Maareecha, his Lanka, built with refined gold, will be burnt to ashes in Sundara Kanda.</p>
