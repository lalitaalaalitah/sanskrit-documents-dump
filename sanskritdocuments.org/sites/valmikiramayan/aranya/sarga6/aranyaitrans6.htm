  <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p class="txt">
 After the heavenward journey of Sage Sharabhanga, Rama is approached by
          others sages and hermits. They inform him about the atrocities of demons around that
          place. They all ask Rama to eradicate the menace and Rama avows to do so, in order to
          keep up the tranquillity of those hermitages, and also to obliterate the menace of demons
          from earth.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 We have not heard of any chariot or horse being utilised by Rama, let alone in
  some episodes of his student days, because he is more a foot soldier than a horse/chariot rider.
  How these sages suddenly say that Rama is a speedy charioteer, is the question. This <em>mahaa
  rathaH</em> concept is on the analogy of Krishna the charioteer in Bharata. In Vedanta, the human
  body is frequently referred as <em>ratha</em>, as in <em>ashva kraante rathaH kraante
  vishNukraante vasu.ndharaa...</em> , Sec. I-37 Mahanaaraayano panishad: 'O, earth that is
  traversed by a horse [in Vedic rituals,] a chariot, [great souls, why they all when] Vishnu
  himself treaded on you as Trivikrama... hence I pray you...' Hence the chariot, drawn by the
  five-senses as its horses, and the earth are also brought and said here by sages.
  Krishna-Arjuna's chariot too had five-horses. Here the sages with controlled senses, namely
  horses, are asking the one who chariots/spins the earth and earthlings, to take off the children
  of lesser gods, namely demons, far away from humans where humans are god controlled species.</p>

 The above is the apparent meaning. The subtext is "Are you, the supreme
  charioteer of Ikshvaku dynasty alone, like Indra for celestial beings? And are you the supreme
  charioteer of this earth and earthlings alone? Not so...you are the Supreme of the whole
  Universe, therefore your reputation is well known in all the three worlds. Thus you the
  Omni-Luminescent entered in Ikshvaku dynasty in the form of Rama, to perform your duties like
  abiding by father's word, with your usual qualities like abounding virtuousness, safeguarding
  dharma in respect of your own creation/ maintenance..." Thus this is the confrontation-like-

 Special supplication to god is a waste. His mercy has to flows on its own
  accord. Why beg him to perform his own duty? If by mistake, an appeal is made to god to alleviate
  a personal problem, his pardon may to be begged, but he is not be begged to do favours. Here the
  sages on one hand say that 'you have come here in the incarnation of Rama to eradicate evil...'
  At the same time, they say 'we have an appeal for the same...' This begging off, is as per social

  for this <em>sharaNyam</em>, thus you aare the protector of all worlds. <em>sharaNa artham</em>
  is taken as to 'place us at our appropriate place,' namely in the abode after total salvation;
  <em>sam upasthitaa or sam upaagamaa</em> as in other versions, we have come here with
  <em>vishvaasa</em>, faithfulness, <em>sharaNaagati</em> , servitude, <em>kainkarya</em> ,
  surrender etc.; <em>naH paripaalaya</em> protect us and with this word, it is again repeated in
  next verse as <em>paripaalaya naH</em> ; and later in the verse the request - from what to be
  protected is said. That is <em>aniSTa nivR^itti ruupa phala praarthana</em>, 'removal of that
  which is undesirable.' That is to say: 'we better be given total salvation rather than killed by
  these demons, which is half way through our exercise to attain total salvation.' is the subtext
  of the speech of sages.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 There is no way-out on this earth, for that matter of fact in all the
  universe, when the 'earth' becomes <em>upa lakshNa</em> for all worlds. This is in consonance
  with the scripture's saying, <em>na anyaH panthaa vidyate ayanaaya...puruSa suukta</em> R.V. X-90
  and thus those sages say 'we are contaminated with limited fruition of our practices <em>parimita
  phalatva</em>, and other suchlike limitations. But you are evident here...before our naked
  eyes...so protect us from the demons...' where the demons, <em>raakshsebhyaH</em> comes to mean
  <em>sarva aniSTaaH</em>, all earthly undesirables. Again coupled with the vocation of 'Oh
  Prince...' it is said as: "you have come here like a prince of Ayodhya, unlike a wild boar, or a
  fish or a man-lion, your earlier incarnations, so remember us and give us salvation...</p>

  <p class="comment">
 Rama's saying that 'I am at your command, oh sages...' is indicative of his
  nature of <em>bhakta jana vashya</em>... in the control of his ardent devotees, so no special
  prayer for salvation is needed. In the expression <em>kevalene aatma/sva kaaryeNa</em>... the
  word <em>kevala</em> is not a <em>kevala pada</em> ... just a word... it indicates a radical
  sense, like 'for that purpose only' meaning to eradicate demonic menace only, I entered the
  forest...' Because the <em>sheSin</em> has to come to the rescue of <em>sheSi</em>, the servant.
  So 'safeguarding my own servants is my own responsibility and also pleasure, that is why I
  entered the forests, where my father's orders are <em>nimitta</em>, a concomitant factor, and not
  that I entered these forest due to my karma, or misfortune...' Govindaraja. According to
  Maheshvara Tirtha 'My coming to forests at the orders of my father is a fact but concomitant
  factor in this forest trek is your request to eliminate the demons, which I will do...' This is
  evident meaning. The latent one is "I have entered these forests only at my own desire to
  eradicate demons, for they are doing wrong to you, my servants <em>sheSin</em>-s, and I abide by
  you, my devotees...' c.f., </p>
