are <em>a + maanuSaan bhogaan </em>&#39;super human luxuries...&#39; as well as <em>divyaan </em>

’you are Goddess Lakshmi, an inner-ruler in all beings... though Dasharatha was uninterested to 
select Bharata you made Dasharatha, as his inner force, to select a spineless Bharata, and Bharata 
is established on the throne by Dasharatha, through you... besides, though Dasharatha was 
disinterested to send his dear eldest son Rama to forests, you as Dasharatha’s inner force, made 
Dasharatha to send Rama, the eldest, best, and the only ruler of people, namely Rama, [as said in 
Vishnu’s Thousand names,] to forests for the elimination of demons, and thereby to release us from 
our accursed being... hence you, as inner force of everybody, have to come with me, if Rama’s 
incarnation is to yield its results...’ Maheshvara Tiirtha. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="comment">
When a tempter can convincingly prove that a woman&#39;s husband is &#39;unfit&#39; then only he can succeed in 
his overtures. His theorematic reasoning is to let down Rama from Seetha&#39;s viewpoint, as she has 
broad-eyes, and she is supposed to see reality: &#39;Rama is rendered to nothing as said in an age-old 
saying <em>bhagnaa kR^iSe bhaagavataa bhavanti </em>&#39;when manly pursuits fail, he turns out as a 
sanctimonious person... <em>sanyaasi, bairaag, </em>a friar...&#39; Hence, living with him here will 
cause only eye-soar in looking at these murky forests, to your wide-eyes... thus, come with me...&#39;

a Rama...&#39; <em>gata cetasaa </em>&#39;devoid of inner soul...&#39; He by himself is the Cosmic Soul and no 
duality of souls occurs in the Absolute Soul. Because He has no duality, there will be no duality in 
his acts <em>na tasya kaaryam, kaaraNam na vidyate... shruti. </em>Then He is <em>taapasena

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, modest lady, on refusing me you surely become remorseful like Uurvashi who once kicked Puruurava 
with her feet. [3-48-18]</p>

<p class="comment">
Uurvashi is one among the four celestial chief maidens, apsara-s, namely, Uurvashi, Rambha, Menaka 
and Tiolottama. When Vishnu was in His meditation all the other apsara-s came to Him to disturb His 
meditation. Knowing that, Vishnu gave birth to this Uurvashi from his things. Thus, she is called 
the one who came from thighs <em>uuruH </em>&#39;from thighs...&#39; and this word is defined as <em>uru 
vaSTi </em>&#39;muchly, splendorous one...&#39; Then the other apsara-s had to accept ashamedly that 
Uurvashi is a beauty of higher order. Kalidasa took this as his subject for his drama 
&#39;Vikramorvashiiyam.&#39;</p>

&#39;Serendipity&#39; is the faculty of making happy and unexpected discoveries by accident... coined by 
Horace Walpole [1754] after The Three Princes of Serendip [now Sri Lanka,] a fairy tale. Now as a 
Lankan, let Ravana also say so.

Ravana, the devotee is saying: <em>yuddhe </em>&#39;in war...&#39; <em>yasya angulyaaH samaH ko api na asti

&quot;In battlefield none can match that Rama even by his little finger, for He is none other than 
Vishnu, and such a Vishnu chanced here in the human incarnation as Rama, and let fortune betide me

Rama in high honour... for all this to happen first you come with me...&quot; Maheshvara Tiirtha.

The lonely place is an advantageous place for such tempters. But if the tempted is self-controlled, 
nothing adverse can happen. <em>raagam viviktaa iti vardhayanti </em>&#39;inclination increases in 
isolation...&#39; But Seetha is disinclined to any such advances or lures or temptations. Some

<p class="comment">
Seetha iterated twice about Shaci Devi for reinforcing her argument. She did not
say 'on abducting me you will not survive...' but said 'on abducting me, or women like me...' this
is to say that any husband devote-wife is not to be subjected to such humiliation. Further, this is
for <em>ashliila nivaaraNa artham</em> 'to avoid obscenity from the mouth of this principal
character in legend....' Govindaraja. As Seetha is unsure whether Ravana consumed ambrosia or not,
but, 'if your-like malicious minded beings, though they have gulped <em>amR^ita</em> 'ambrosia'
there is no <em>moksha</em> 'release, deliverance...' from death-birth cycle and that
<em>moksha</em> is possible through wise thinking... and, as your soul is full with foulness, that
unwise state of yours will never attain <em>moksha...'</em> Rama Tilaka Commentary.</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">Who is a pati vrata - husband-devote?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3" class="comment">Seetha is considered as a topmost husband-devotee and there must 
be some reasons for this. A devote-wife is one who abides by her wedded husband through thick and thin. 
The reasons for the umpteen number of divorces that are happening all around the globe are incorporated 
in the following simple verses:</font></p>

<p class="ItrSloka">

puruSam sevate na anyam mano vaak kaaya karmabhiH |<br>lobhitaa api pareNa arthiaH saa sati loka 
bhuuSaNaa ||<br>dainyena praathitaa vaa api balena vidhR^itaa vaa api |<br>vastra aadyaIh vaasitaa 
vaa api na eva anyam bhajate satii ||
<br>na anyam kaamate citte saa vij~neyaa pati vrataa || <br></font>
</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3" class="comment">&#39;She who devotes herself 
to her own man, but not to any other man, with her heart, word and deed, she alone is the jewel in world... 
though enticed by others with riches or intimidated with forcefulness, or tempted with richly clothing 
[and others womanly fancies, but one on discarding them all] attends her own man... she who does not 
wish other man even in her heart of hearts, she alone is a husband-devote...&#39;</font></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3" class="comment">As such, there are no extraordinary talents or traits that make 
an ideal woman as a husband-devote, except her abidance to the sacredness of marriage as an institution. 
The domestic quarrelling, bickering, nagging... all these persists in every home, but making a mountain 
of that anthill, will eventually lead to the collapse of that institution of marriage. No doubt, Seetha 
is a nagging, quarrelling, and sermonising, tongue-lashing woman but if it comes to her husband, she 
is undone without him, though he lost his empire, roaming in forests, eating trash etc., and yet she 
does not depart from her pledge to the institution of marriage.</font></font></p>
