<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 45<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="txt">
Seetha rebukes Lakshmana for he is still here, loitering away even after listening Rama&#39;s cry for help. 
She goes to the extent of slandering him as having intents to woo her, at the cost of Rama&#39;s life. Lakshmana 
tries to pacify her but in vain, as she persists in her rash talk. Lakshmana leaves her alone and starts 
to reach Rama, broken-heartedly.</p>

<p class="tat">
This is a much debated chapter in Ramayana because human complexities are involved in its narration. 
The sublimity of Seetha&#39;s characterisation is disputed by her speeches in here. The question is whether 
Seetha becomes an ideal woman in view of her tongue-lashing, or not. This is as good as asking the nature 
as to &#39;why it thunders before a storm, scaring children, birds and calves... cannot it just shower some 
rains and go...&#39; If anything is not done in accordance with her wish and whim, or which goes against 
her peculiar way of thinking, it is usual for a shrewd woman to tongue-lash. Here, Seetha is called 
a woman who is <em>bhartR^i prema antha - bhartR^i kShema arthi</em> &#39;blinded by the devotement to her 
husband...&#39; &#39;a desirer of her husband&#39;s welfare...&#39; even at her own risk.</p>

<p class="tat">
This Ramayana is not the story of Rama. It is <em>raama ayana</em> and becomes <em>raamaayaNa</em> when 
compounded. Again <em>raama</em> is not the epical hero Rama alone. Seetha is also <em>raamaa</em> as 
said by Sumantra in Ayodhya, Ch. 60, 10th verse:</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
baalaa iva ramate siitaa a baala candra nibha aananaa |<br>raamaa raame hi adiinaatmaa vijane api vane 
sati</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;like an young girl Seetha, with not so young moon&#39;s face, [i.e., like the full moon,] is delighting 
herself even in uninhabited forests with Rama...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
Thus this epic is called <em>raamaa raamayoH ayanam raamaayaNam</em> &#39;the peregrination of Seetha and 
Rama...&#39; where the first word <em>raamaa</em> with elongated end syllable belongs to Seetha and the 
second <em>raama</em> with shortened end syllable belongs to Rama, and thus this is the peregrination 
of both Raamaa and Raama. If the course of the legend has to move forward, the characters have to move, 
and if they were to move, some situations should become turning points, and this is one such situation 
occasioned through the shrewdness of Seetha. In a legendary perspective, if evil is to be eliminated, 
good has to peregrinate troublesomely, and that troublesome peregrination of Seetha, as well as that 
of Rama, is triggered off at this situation, again due to the shrewdness of Seetha. Thus, there is no 
oddity in the shrewd talk of Seetha. Some more discussion is incorporated in the endnote.</p>

Lakshmana said Seetha &#39;be lost in desolation...&#39; in the first instance and further said that she &#39;be

as a vexed person and then, on knowing what that is suddenly uttered by him, he is correcting himself

These intimidations of Seetha that she will commit suicide by consuming poison, hanging, plunging in 
river, self-immolation etc., are not new to Seetha or to any woman, under these irksome situations. 
She is giving many alternatives for suicide and the last one is self-immolation. If she is not going 
to die by hanging herself, or by consuming poison, or by drowning in river, then the question of self-immolation 
comes up. But she lists all of them in her anguish for Rama. With the same impetuosity she jumps into 
fire in the episode of <em>agni praveshanam </em>after war, when Rama belittles her. There also, she 
orders the very same Lakshmana to arrange pyre for her, disregarding her own accusations made at Lakshmana,

Bringing the folded palms up to one&#39;s own heart is suggestive of &#39;pouring forth one&#39;s own heart&#39; at 
the other, which is known in prayers as <em>iungo manus ante pectus </em>and if it is lifted up to forehead, 
it is suggestive of &#39;concentrating with whole of the mind,&#39; and if hands are totally lifted into air 
it is for the god unknown. But here this <em>iungere manus </em>is neither <em>ante pectus, infra pectus,

interested, greeting...&#39; &#39;a half-hearted gesture&#39; like a &#39;cold-handshake&#39; rather than a &#39;warm&#39; one because

to be like that. A woman can be said as cow-faced-tigress, as: <em>go mukha vyaaghra,</em> [not in dissent.] 
She prowls, growls and howls at others if her interests are contradicted. Thus, Seetha&#39;s is not only 
a sacred cow but also a shrewd lioness-princess, and her rash talking is not new or instantaneous at 
this place alone. She said something against Kaikeyi with Sumantra, which, Sumantra does not report 
to Kausalya in Ayodhya Kanda, chapter 60, and verse 14. One full chapter, Aranya Kanda of 9th is catered 
to Seetha&#39;s haranguing Rama, when Rama wanted to wage an unprovoked war. She does not spare even her 
own husband, if the contemplated deed is contrary to her thinking, and because she is countering her 
own husband she includes a saving clause, &#39;I have spoken in all my womanliness... it is up to you to 
decide....&#39; otherwise it will be a straight tongue-lashing. Thus talking riff-raff with Lakshmana is 
no great surprise.</p>

<p class="comment">
Further, she is angering through perplexity caused by the hearing a help cry similar in tone with her 
husband&#39;s voice: <em>bhartR^i aarta svara sadR^isham aakrandanam aakraNya vidiirNa hR^idayaa hR^idaya 
dayitu premNaa kartavyam ajaananaa jaanakii - - - sam utpanna kopayaa siitayaa - bhaaShitam - dk</em> 
Seetha said <em>mama hetoH praticchannaH</em> &#39;for me you are covertly behaving...&#39; and Lakshmana, who 
is famous for his rashness also said to Seetha <em>tiikShNaa bhedakaraaH striyaH</em> &#39;women are the 
severe wreckers...&#39; of households, kingdoms etc., remembering Sage Agastya&#39;s saying in Aranya, Ch. 13 
verse 6: &#39;With the dangling of hundreds of streaks of thunderbolt and also a weapon&#39;s incisiveness, 
and also with the speediness of an eagle and wind&#39;s gust, the women are conformable...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Besides, Seetha vowed to offer many oblations to Ganga, when crossing that river to enter the deep of 
forests in Ayodhya II, Ch. 52, verses 87-90: <em>suraa ghaTa sahasreNa maamsa bhuuta odanena ca yakShyaami 
aham</em> &#39;I will offer thousand pots of liquor, meaty food, if, my husband and I return safely...&#39; 
Even though Shiromani Vyaakhya says that these are not liquor pots or it is not the meat food, yet they 
are some offerings to be made by Seetha to Ganga, if they return. She uses many &#39;if&#39; clauses while praying 
thus, for the safety of her husband. What will become of them, if Rama&#39;s life itself is at stake?</p>

<p class="comment">
Here, both Seetha and Lakshmana, are accusing each other. It is not reiterated elsewhere in Ramayana, 
and hence some say that this episode is an interpolation. &#39;Can these two go on narrating this scandalous 
dialogue to somebody, detailing how each accused the other...&#39; is the ensuing question. This episode 
has happened in between these two and it does not merit a discussion with somebody else, because such 
a discussion will attract many <em>cha, cha</em>-s, and <em>chi, chi</em>-s for Seetha, hence this 
is neither an interpolation nor a repeatable episode.</p>

<p class="comment">
Then the commentator concludes in saying that each of them is right in his/her way and in emotion, situation 
and portent. <em>siitaa vacanasya bharti aarta shabda shravaNa samjaata kheda vashena aapadi raamo avashyam 
samrakShaNiiya iti etat abhipraayakatvaat | lakShmaNa vacanam api ayukta tara siitaa vacana shravaNa 
janita kopa vashena pravR^ittam | agastya vacanam tu svataH saralaa siitaa iti abhipraayakam iti na 
virodhaH - - dk</em></p>

<p class="comment">
Later, Seetha repents for her rash talk with Lakshmana in yuddha kaaNDa, Ch. 113, verses 40, 45-46, 
saying:....</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
bhaagya vaiShamya doSheNa purastaat duShkR^itena ca |<br>mayaa etat praapyate sarvam sva kR^itam hi 
upbhujyate ||<br>paapaanaam vaa shubhaanaam vaa vadhaarhaaNaam api vaa |<br>kaaryam kaaruNyam aaryeNa 
na kashcit na aparaadhyate ||</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;When my fate is against me, and when my earlier sins [of finding fault with Lakshmana,] have acquired 
this [incarceration in Lanka...] one has to reap the results of one&#39;s own faults... a sinner, or a do-gooder, 
or one undergoing a capital punishment shall be treated kindly... who is he/she that does not offend...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
These are the very same words of Sugreeva in Kishkindha, Ch. 36, verse 11: &quot;Either in faith or in friendliness 
if I have overstepped, in the least, that may be pardoned for I am an attendant of yours... for, none 
is unoffending...&#39; All this culminates into the saying &#39;to err is human...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
On the other hand, in the perspective of mythology, the time has come for Seetha to go to Lanka, in 
order to effectuate her curse to Ravana as Vedavati, where Vedavati cursed Ravana, &#39;I will be the root 
cause for your total elimination... as Seetha...&#39; For such a transit, Rama shall go away from her, for 
that she wanted that golden deer and as a good husband Rama ran after it. But this security guard is 
an obstinate obstacle than Rama and he will not go away from here, because he has to keep custody of 
his brother&#39;s entrustment. Unless such unbearable words are spoken to a self-respectful person like 
Lakshmana, he doe not stir out. To stop his leeching onto her, she had to talk in an abnormal way, which 
made him to go away, though reluctantly, and which paved the way for Ravana&#39;s entry. If the Golden Deer 
is not there, Rama will not go, if Rama&#39;s voice is not heard Lakshmana cannot be sent, and if Lakshmana 
does not go, Ravana will not come... then a blemish called <em>anavasthaa doSha</em> -- ad infintum...occurs 
to Ramayana. If we do not mind to end Ramayana in that way, Ravana will be ruling high, even today...</p>
