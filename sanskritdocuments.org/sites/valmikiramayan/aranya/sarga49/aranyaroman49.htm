<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Seetha&#39;s abduction takes place now. Ravana forcefully abducts Seetha in his air-chariot. She bewails 
and bemoans for Rama and Lakshmana and appeals to all nature to inform Rama about this abduction. Finally, 
she sees Jatayu, the eagle, and asks him to narrate her abduction to Rama.</p>

sītāyā vacanam śrutvā daśagrīvaḥ pratāpavān |<br>haste hastam samāhatya cakāra sumahat vapuḥ || 3-49-1</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. prataapavaan dashagriivaH</em> = valorous one, Ten-headed Ravana; <em>siitaayaa vacanam shrutvaa</em> 
= Seetha&#39;s, words, on hearing; <em>haste hastam sam aahatya</em> = on palm, with palm, well [loudly,] 
clapped; <em>su mahat vapuH cakaara</em> = very mighty, [his] body, made [divulged,].</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing Seetha&#39;s words that valorous ten-headed Ravana loudly clapped in dissent for once and divulged 
his very mighty body. [3-49-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
These beings, including Hanuma, change into titanic form when they are infuriated. A cruel aspect minus 
anger is not in consonance with each. Thus, Ravana got wild first, but he does not want to hide his 
reality before his Goddess Lakshmi, hence he divulged his real aspect. Maheshvara Tiirtha.</p>

sa maithilīm punaḥ vākyam babhāṣe vākya kovidaḥ |<br>na unmattayā śrutau manye mama vīrya parākramau 
|| 3-49-2</p>

<p class="pratipada">

= my, valour, vanquishes; <em>na shrutau manye</em> = not, unheard, I think.</p>

<p class="tat">
That wordsmith Ravana again spoke these words to Maithili, &quot;Perhaps you have not heard about my valour 
and vanquishes in all your madness for Rama. [3-49-2]</p>

<p class="comment">
Ravana as devotee is saying to Seetha: &#39;unheard are my valour and vanquishes na unmattayaa : matta janaat 
udgataa unmatta bhinna taa dR^ishayaa &#39;not mad... you are far from the maddened crowd, you are opposite 
of a mad personality...&#39; na unmattayaa tvayaa na shrutau manye... &#39;though you are not a madcap in reality, 
you did not give any ear to my valour and vanity...&#39; Maheshvara Tiirtha.</p>

<p class="comment">
Once the demon Mahisha-asura was eliminated by Goddess Durga, a female, and Ravana is now talking to 
a female, [and maybe she is also in disguise like him.] If this woman assumes her real nature at the 
time of abduction, the abduction will not be easy and handy. Hence, before her assuming her real form, 
it is better to show his real entity. Thus, he clapped for once before changing into his real entity. 
Or, the role-play of a Brahman sanyasi is not in consonance with the villainous abduction and that garb 
of a Brahman itself is a hindrance to his original atrocious nature known to world as raa vaNa &#39;one 
who makes people to cry...&#39; thus vexed with this role-paying of a Brahman, he clapped loudly and infuriately, 
for once. Rama Tilaka.</p>

Ravana spoke to Seetha. [3-49-13b, 14, 15a]</p>

<p class="comment">
For the verses from 11 to 14 Maheshvara Tiirtha, a very ancient commentator, tries hard to establish 
Ravana as an absolute devotee of Goddess Lakshmi, for Ravana himself was their doorkeeper in heaven 
before his accursed being. He is one from the two doorkeepers in vaikuNTha &#39;abode of Lord Vishnu and 
Lakshmi&#39; called Jaya and Vijaya Ravana is Jaya, the doorkeeper. That commentary is like this. yadi aham 
patiH &#39;if, I am, the lord...&#39; raakshasaam iti seSaH elliptic, &#39;of demons...&#39; tava sadR^ishaH : kim bhR^itya 
- iti seSaH &#39;you befitting, elliptic, am I a befitting servant - no I am not...&#39; &#39;Although I am not 
a good servant of yours, but if you wish to me be one, triSu lokeSu vikhyaataam yathaa tathaa &#39;as if 
to become famous in all the three worlds...&#39; maam bhartaaram aashraya &#39;me, as servant, accept...&#39; Here 
bharta is defined as shushruuSa aadinaa svaaminam bibharti iti bhartaa - bhR^itya iti arthaH &#39;one who 
serves his master by his services is bhartaa. Thus bhartaa does not only mean a husband but also a servant. 
Why should she accept Ravana now as a newly recruited servant? Because ciraaya tava shlaaghyaH &#39;for 
a long time I have been extolling you in vaikunTha as Jaya...&#39; and I am a priya : priiNayati iti shshruuSa 
aadinaa svaaminam - iti priya bhR^ityaH &#39;a dear, earnest servant of yours...&#39; maam bhajasva &#39;you know 
me thus as your humble servant...&#39; maanuSe bhaava tyajataam &#39;humans only are to be saved..&#39; - you leave 
this thinking and think that we the demons are also to be saved...&#39; muuDhe paNDita maaninii mayi bhaava 
praNiiyataam &#39;Although I am an unread stupid, grace me too because I am your long serving servant...&#39; 
Further, Rama is raajyaat cyutam &#39;not fallen from kingship, but he is a spurner of kingly pleasures, 
he thrusts these small things back with his foot...&#39; why because a siddha artham - ashca asau siddha 
arthaH ca &#39;Vishnu is one with His purposes fulfilled... thus He does not care for a petty kingdom, when 
He is the King of Kings...&#39; parimita aayuSam : parigatam - tyaktam; mitam - alpam - aayuH yena tam - 
a parimita aayuSam &#39;He is an eternal entity...&#39; kaiH guNaiH - kaiH= anirvacaniiya; guNaiH= ananta kalyaaNa 
guNa shiila &#39;One with indefinable, illimitable auspicious merits...&#39; anuraktaa asi &#39;you are impassioned 
for such a Vishnu, though... and I have no objection for that, but bless me too... durmati : duSTeSu 
api matiH - anugraahikaa buddhi &#39;He is not a mindless person, but he has a mind for the mindless and 
bad-minded persons like me... So please come with me and let your husband follow you to Lanka and accord 
salvation, as planned by you all...&#39; Maheshvara Tiirtha.</p>

<p class="comment">
What happened to the lakshmaNa rekha? &#39;A boundary drawn by Lakshmana when he departed Seetha in search 
of Rama?&#39; Some discussion about this is there in the endnote. Here, even though Ravana is su duSTa aatmaa, 
kaama mohitaa &#39;a very wicked souled and lustily crazed....&#39; it is all for other women, but not towards 
Seetha. And thus he caught hold of Seetha, as the planet Budha, Jupiter, the son of Moon catches his 
own Star mother Rohini, a dear wife the Moon, reverentially. Maheshvara Tiirtha. Later commentators 
rejected this saying that, if it were to be so, then Ravana has Oedipus complex.</p>

Seetha firstly appealed to the trees frenziedly. But reasoning herself that the trees can tell only

Presuming that the water loving water birds may not penetrate the deep forest, and then she appealed

not be able to see through the thick of forest, she is now asking the animals and birds that usually

Nobility will not seek help selfishly; if help is sought that way, the seeker instantly becomes an ignoble, 
falling from the heights of personal nobility. Seetha may be an impetuous lady but if she talking to 
a noble elderly person or being, she talks judiciously in all her humbleness. Here she is not asking 
Jatayu to wage a war against Ravana to save her. She is asking Jatayu to convey the news of her abduction 
to Rama, because as an old eagle, as old as her father-in-law, Jatayu may not fight back this Ravana 
successfully. Besides, Ravana is with weaponry and a cunning warrior. Jatayu may be a powerful eagle, 
but if it comes to weapons and missiles, a natural being cannot withstand the artificial ammunition 
of war. Hence, visualising the danger in Jatayu&#39;s attempting any combat with Ravana, she is asking him 
to be the carrier of news, as all the trees, river and her birds, sylvan deities, and the other birds 
and animals are not heedful of her request, and this eagle alone is beheld, besides being an old acquaintance.</p>

Is Sheetha an &#39;untouchable&#39;?</p>

<p class="comment">
Whether Seetha is touched by Ravana or not - is a much debated issue by ancient commentators. When Ravana 
is carrying a curse on his head, that makes his head/heads to be splintered, if he lustfully touches 
any woman, against her will, it is questioned how his head is not splintered now, when touching Seetha. 
Maheshvara Tiirtha brings in <em>skaanda puraaNa</em> which says that: <em>chaayaa graahitvam api asi 
sarva vidyaa vishaarade | kesha chaayaam paraamR^ishya jaanu chaayam tahaiva ca | gR^ihiitvaa jaanakiim 
hR^iShTo lankaam praayaa tathaa eva ca |</em> &#39;Ravana being an expert in all branches of sciences, caught 
Janaki by the shadow of her head-hair and the shadow of thighs...&#39; Maheshvara Tiirtha.</p>

<p class="comment">
For this Rama Tilaka says yet another way of catching Seetha, as explained for the verse at 3-49-17:
<em>muurdhajeSu kareNa : muudhaja iSu kareNa &#39;</em>best ones, arrows, with hands...&#39; &#39;with the hands 
that handle the best arrows... Seetha is caught...&#39; <em>vaama kareNa uurvo saH pari jagraaha </em>here 
the word <em>uuru </em>which usually translates as &#39;thighs&#39; is said as &#39;feet...&#39; &#39;Ravana caught hold 
of her feet as the Planet Budha, the Jupiter caught the feet of his mother Star Rohini in early times; 
and now iks requesting his personal deity Goddess Lakshmi to come to Lanka. Rama Tilaka.</p>

<p class="comment">
Catching Seetha while she is standing is not possible in both the ways as said above. She should be 
in a supine position on ground to handle her from under her thighs or at the nape of the neck. Her falling 
on ground is not explicitly said in these verses in Aranya. But Seetha says at verse 3-49-34, that &#39;in 
a state of helplessness, I am abducted...&#39; This word <em>vivasha, vi vashatvam</em> is not only &#39;helplessness...&#39; 
but also a state of &#39;swooning...&#39; She repeats the same wording in Sundara Kanda and even in Yuddha Kanda 
II at verse 8 of 116 sarga, while replying Rama&#39;s accusation, in saying that <em>yadi aham gaatra samsparsham 
gataa asmi vivashaa prabho</em> &#39;when I was &#39;helpless&#39; I was touched by Ravana... fault is not mine, 
gods alone have fouled it...&#39; Thus, it is assumed that Seetha was in a short swoon when caught by Ravana. 
Then again, when she was rolling on ground in the same state Ravana lifts her up by her waist into his 
air-chariot.</p>

<p class="comment">
All this discussion is to establish Seetha is an &#39;untouchable&#39; for others, and for fear of a blemish 
to her <em>paativratya &#39;</em>husband-devotness...&#39; which topic will be raised by no other than Rama, 
after war. The absolute devotees of Rama or Seetha hold Ravana&#39;s touching Seetha, as an intolerable 
act. Thus, to portray that Seetha is &#39;untouchable&#39; there are many more legends woven around this topic.</p>

<p class="comment">
One among it is <em>lakshmaNa rekha &#39;</em>Lakshmana&#39;s drawing a line around the hermitage, like a firewall...&#39; 
When Seetha transgressed this firewall and came out of it to offer alms to Ravana, in Brahman sanyaasi&#39;s 
guise, she in her fear fell down on ground, as said in <em>aadhyaatma raamaayaNa</em> in the verse:
<em>tato vidaarya dharaNiim nakhaiH uddhR^itya baahubhiH | tolayitvaa rathe kShiptaa yayau kShipram 
vihaayasaa || &#39;</em>then [Ravana] cleaved the earth with his nails, uplifting that clod with his hands 
and with a balancing act put it in the air-chariot, and quickly went away in skyway...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Another anthology says that Rama while going after the Golden Deer, hid the real Seetha and placed a
<em>maayaa siitaa &#39;</em> an illusory Seetha...&#39; in the cottage. This deceptive Seetha is continued until 
her self-immolation after Great War. Real Seetha emerged out of the pyre instead of this Maya Seetha. 
Then it is questioned, whether the bemoaning and bewailing of Rama for Seetha, throughout the later 
part of the epic is to hoodwink the readers or so? It is then replied that this also is one among the 
many miraculous effects of Vishnu <em>viSNu maaya</em> All this culminates into the saying of Bhagavad 
Gita: <em>vyavasaayaatmikaa buddhiH eka iha kuru nandana | bahu shakhaa hi anantaah ca buddhayo avyavasaayiNaam 
|| 2-41</em> &#39;the object to determine is distinct singularly, and many and unending are those who say 
manifoldly with indistinct minds....&#39;</p>

Nothing happens by mere touching of Seetha, for she is a resolute lady to abide by her husband Rama. 
Valmiki is very clear in picturing her to be a stubborn and staunch husband-devote, and no more mythological 
bends are required to prove her chastity. She herself proved this with her <em>agni pravesha &#39; </em>
self-immolation...&#39; to all concerned. If Seetha acquired a blemish by mere touch, then Draupadi will 
be in a more pathetic state, since she is physically handled by Keecaka, that too when she is in her 
senses. The common feature in both the cases is, some other man &#39;touching their braids...&#39; A woman&#39;s 
head hair cannot be touched by anybody in molestation. <em>atra dashagriivo atyanta avamati ruupam kula 
kShaya karam kesha grahaNam svasya bhavitavya anuruupatayaa kR^itavaa | kesha grahaNasya - sabhaa nayana 
- paruSha bhaaShaNa - vastra apaharaNa - aadi apekShayaa - vadhopekShayaa ca atyanta avamati karatvam 
kula kShaya karatva ca bhaarate prati paaditam - dk</em> &#39;Ravana is predestined for self-ruin, hence 
touched the braid of Seetha, and touching the braid of a lady, dragging her to king&#39;s court, roughly 
talking to her, undressing her, all these lead to the destruction of one&#39;s own clan, as demonstrated 
in Maha Bharata...&#39; In <em>vana parva of mahA bhaarata</em>, when Draupadi goes on complaining that 
&#39;I am dragged by my braid... I am dragged by my braid...&#39; Krishna says to Draupadi: <em>rudiShyanti 
striyo hi evam yeShaam kruddhaa asi bhaamini | satyam te pratijaanaaami raaj~naa raaj~nii bhaviShyasi 
||</em> &#39;you women always go on weeping for such tings... [having suffered in such a way,] I promise 
that you alone will become the empress...&#39; So also, Seetha is instrumental for the elimination of evil, 
called Ravana together with all his clansmen. This is as pledged by Veadavati, an earlier incarnation 
of Goddess Lakshmi. As such, Seetha has to go to Lanka to attend that complete eradication, according 
to mythology.</p>

<p class="comment">
Whether it is myth or real she is not all a frailty to yield up that easily nor a weak bodied one for 
an easy molestation. She travelled the length and breadth of the country barefooted, that too in impenetrable 
forests. These ladies of lore had their yogic faculties with which Gaandhaari, the mother Duryodhana, 
in Maha Bharata makes him a diamond-bodied one, excepting his thighs. Their words come true if they 
utter them with certain concentration. At the time of burning the tail of Hanuma in Sundara Kaanda Seetha 
says: <em>siito bhava &#39;</em>cool down...&#39; &#39;Let the fire on the tail of that monkey be coolant to him...&#39; 
and it happened accordingly. That burning tail burnt whole Lanka, except some places, without any scorching 
effect on Hanuma. Likewise she would have said at Ravana <em>hato bhava &#39;</em>dead, you are...&#39; but 
she does not say so. Rama&#39;s pledge to saints and sages to eliminate evil on earth is to be fulfilled 
by Rama alone.</p>

<p class="comment">
Leaving the untouchablness or otherwise of Seetha aside, since every negative act is to be solemnised, 
let us listen to the fruits of listening or reading of this episode, <em>siitaa apaharaNa &#39;</em>abduction 
of Seetha...&#39; as it involves the elimination of evil on earth, <em>Skanda Puraana</em> says &#39;nothing 
inauspicious will happen to those best people who listen this episode of Seetha&#39;s abduction...&#39;</p>
