<h3><b>Valmiki Ramayana - Aranya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 63</b><br>
 </h3>
</center>

<p class="txt">Rama laments while searching for Seetha and reminiscing over his past, which was
spent happily with Seetha. Rama and Lakshmana search for her at riversides of Godavari but she is
unseen there. Though Lakshmana continuously encourages Rama for a thorough search without
submitting to mere anguish, Rama sinks into his own anguish.</p>

<p class="verloc">.</p>
<p class="tat"> </p>
<p class="tat">That prince Rama whom agony and anguish are distressing has become anxious in his
mien, and he again drifted into a dire desperation while despairing his brother Lakshmana. Rama who
is sunken in a chasmal sorrow spoke this sentence while wailing sorrowfully, suspiring severely and
scorchingly, and which sentence is seemly to his sensitivity, to Lakshmana who is already under the
sway of sorrow.</p>
<p class="tat">"I am second to none among the blameworthy wrongdoers on this earth, thus I deem,
and indeed woe followed by woe are getting at me in seriation to burst my heart and mind... I might
have definitely, habitually, and desirably committed damnable deeds in my previous births, and now
the result of those impious deeds is very much ripened and has fallen on me, whereby I am entering
misery after misery...</p>
<p class="comment">As with the accrual of merit by good deeds, sin also accrues with impious or
sinful acts <em>anena janmaantara
kR^ita paapa anuruupam phalam bhavati iti arthaH - strii parvaaNi - nuunam vyapakR^itam puurveShu
janmaasu | yena maam duHkhabhaageShu dhaataa karmasu yuktkavaan - mahaa bhaarata -
dk</em> and this ripens and bechances at a later time in the shape of misfortune.</p>
<p class="tat">"I am deprived of the kingdom, departed from my own people, mainly Seetha, my father
departed and I am detached from my mother, and Lakshmana, when all these setbacks are very deeply
thought over they are replenishing the haste of my agony... All this sadness of mine has silenced
physically and there is some peace on coming to these desolate forests, in association of Seetha,
but with the dissociation of Seetha misery is again upshot, as with fire which flares up in a flash
when fuel is added...</p>
<p class="tat">"My noblewoman might be abducted by a demon, and on reaching the sky that lady who
converses with a sweet voice might have wept a lot fearfully, and it is definite that she must have
shouted a lot, untunefully... Those two roundish bosoms of my ladylove which always deserved the
application of pleasantly looking red-sandalwood's paste might definitely be unshiny, as they might
be bedaubed with muddy blood when they are extricated from her body for devouring.</p>
<p class="tat">"She has a sweet, softish, and very clear talkativeness on her lips. That visage
with such lips is crowned with a hairdo with hair lumped together and plaited, such as her visage
is, it must have become unshiny on her going into the repression of demon, as with an unshiny moon
when repressed in the mouth of eclipsing planet Raahu, it is definite... The contours of the neck
of that strait-laced ladylove of mine are always worthy for necklaces and chain-wears. The
bloodthirsty demons would have indeed mangled that neck in a secluded place and they might have
drunk her blood, it is definite...</p>
<p class="tat">"While I was away from her in this uninhibited forest demons would have forcibly
hauled her up when they are abducting that lady with broad-bright eyes, and she would have
discordantly shrieked out like a piteous she-dove, it is definite...</p>
<p class="tat">"Sitting very close to me on this stone's surface, oh, Lakshmana, she that
well-mannered Seetha with bright smiles was speaking to you verbosely with all smiles...</p>
<p class="comment">He is recollecting his romantic dalliances with Seetha at the riverside of
Godavari. <em>asmin</em> 'in here, hereabouts which now is devoid of Seetha, she used to playfully
tease me in our swimming sports in this River Godavari...' <em>maya saartham</em> where <em>maya sa
artham</em> 'I thought I was winning... but, she who is used to have an upper hand... hence, then I
became secondary...' <em>udaara shiilaa</em> 'well-mannered' Seetha... for she did not bother me
for such a frolicking when we were in Ayodhya, and she with all her mannerliness maintained a
distance from me, as there were her father-in-law, mother-in-laws in Ayodhya, but here only two of
us who are with ourselves, and we rejoiced freely...' <em>shilaa tale upa upa viSTaa</em> 'on the
surface of any stone wherever I wanted to gain a foothold after straining myself in swim-games, she
used to reach and sit on each and every acclivitous stone, prior to my reaching it, and she used to
spatter water on my face, to continue more swimming... but, I was really fatigued...' then she is
one <em>jaata haasaa</em> 'in whom laughter took birth...she used to burst out peals of laughter...
that declare me as a defeated one...' And then <em>tvaam bahu vaakya jaata aaha</em> 'she used talk
to you a lot, with lots of words, as you are in the habit of always extolling me, and she was
saying to you... 'you two are mightier than the mighty, but I am a woman, you two are males and can
hunt the cruellest animals, but I am woman, a rabbit in the kitchen... but, see how I defeated your
almighty brother...' and the like...'</p>
<p class="comment">'A very interesting and linguistically important case of a prepositional verb is
provided by the verses [that contain] <em>upopaviSTa... upa vish...</em> originally must have meant
'to sit near'. In course of time, the idea of closeness or proximity was lost and it came to be
used in the sense of sitting only. Now when the idea of nearness or proximity had to be expressed
one more <em>upa</em> was prefixed to it. Thus, we see how tautological tendencies were influencing
Sanskrit in the very hoary past. The Ramayana <em>upopaviSTa</em> has its parallel n Hindi <em>paas
baiThnaa</em> [where] <em>baiThnaa</em> is <em>upa veshana</em> which itself means to sit near
<em>upa= paas</em>. But still <em>paas</em> is used with <em>baiThnaa...'</em> The Ramayana, A
Linguistic Study, Pt. Satya Vrat. And to supplement Panditji's above saying, even in English this
is evident and Oxford in saying meaning for proximity, says 'sat in close proximity to them' where
'proximity' itself is one <em>upa</em> and 'close' is another <em>upa...</em> Thus tautology is
same everywhere.</p>
<p class="tat">"Among rivers this Godavari is the best and it is an all the time cherished river to
my ladylove, and I think she would have gone thereunto. But, at anytime she did not go there,
singly... Or, that lotus-faced, lotus-petal eyed Seetha has gone straight to bring lotuses! Nay,
that idea itself is incongruous, for she never goes to get lotuses, indeed without me... But has
she really gone to this stand of thicket which is with flowered trees and with birds of divers
kind! Nay, that thought also is incongruent, because she as a timid one is much scared of
solitude...</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, Sun, you are the knower of performed and unperformed deeds in the world, a
wittnesser of good and bad deeds in the world, tell me, who am woefully writhing, to where my
ladylove strolled, or is she stolen...</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, Air, whatsoever is there in the world, wheresoever it might be, or whensoever
it might have happened, and whichsoever it might be, and whencesoever it might exist, that cannot
possibly be unknown to you. Hence, tell me of the lady from noble heritage... is she stolen, or
slain, or strayed her steps..." Thus Rama begged of the Eternals for locating Seetha.</p>
<p class="tat">To such a Rama whose physique is routed by his anguish in this way and who is
insensately bewailing in that way, Soumitri whose courage is un-dispirited gave a justifiable and
timely suggestion.</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, noble brother, banish that anguish and brace yourself with fortitude, and let
you be with spiritedness in her searching... indeed, there is no backsliding for spirited men in
their enterprises in this world, even though the enterprises are highly impracticable..."</p>
<p class="comment">Lack of fortitude and spiritedness will sink anyone in a chasmal self-centred
subjective grief. <em>anena dhairya
utsaahau shokam apanudya kaarya saadhakau iti suucitam - tathaa ca bhaatate - droNa parvaaNi -
abhimanyu vadhe dharma putram prati vyaasaH - shocato hi mahaa raaja hi adhame abhivartate |
tasmaat shokam parityajya shreyase prayated budhaH | praharSham abhimaanam ca cintayet | evam
GYaatvaa sthiro bhuutvaa jahi ariin dhairyam aapnuhi | dk</em> Thus Vyaasa advises
Dharmaraja to have fortitude and courage when he was sinking under the grief for the merciless
killing of lonesome Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna, in Maha Bharata war.</p>
<p class="tat">When Soumitri of towering bravery is speaking this way, Rama, the enhancer of
Raghu's lineage, gave no heed to it, and since he castaway his fortitude he again encountered an
inexplicable anguish.</p>
