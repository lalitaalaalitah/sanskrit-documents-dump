<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 63<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama laments while searching for Seetha and reminiscing over his past, which was spent happily with 
Seetha. Rama and Lakshmana search for her at riversides of Godavari but she is unseen there. Though 
Lakshmana continuously encourages Rama for a thorough search without submitting to mere anguish, Rama 
sinks into his own anguish.</p>

<p class="comment">
He is recollecting his romantic dalliances with Seetha at the riverside of Godavari. <em>asmin</em> 
&#39;in here, hereabouts which now is devoid of Seetha, she used to playfully tease me in our swimming sports 
in this River Godavari...&#39; <em>maya saartham</em> where <em>maya sa artham</em> &#39;I thought I was winning... 
but, she who is used to have an upper hand... hence, then I became secondary...&#39; <em>udaara shiilaa</em> 
&#39;well-mannered&#39; Seetha... for she did not bother me for such a frolicking when we were in Ayodhya, and 
she with all her mannerliness maintained a distance from me, as there were her father-in-law, mother-in-laws 
in Ayodhya, but here only two of us who are with ourselves, and we rejoiced freely...&#39; <em>shilaa tale 
upa upa viSTaa</em> &#39;on the surface of any stone wherever I wanted to gain a foothold after straining 
myself in swim-games, she used to reach and sit on each and every acclivitous stone, prior to my reaching 
it, and she used to spatter water on my face, to continue more swimming... but, I was really fatigued...&#39; 
then she is one <em>jaata haasaa</em> &#39;in whom laughter took birth...she used to burst out peals of 
laughter... that declare me as a defeated one...&#39; And then <em>tvaam bahu vaakya jaata aaha</em> &#39;she 
used talk to you a lot, with lots of words, as you are in the habit of always extolling me, and she 
was saying to you... &#39;you two are mightier than the mighty, but I am a woman, you two are males and 
can hunt the cruellest animals, but I am woman, a rabbit in the kitchen... but, see how I defeated your 
almighty brother...&#39; and the like...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;A very interesting and linguistically important case of a prepositional verb is provided by the verses 
[that contain] <em>upopaviSTa... upa vish...</em> originally must have meant &#39;to sit near&#39;. In course 
of time, the idea of closeness or proximity was lost and it came to be used in the sense of sitting 
only. Now when the idea of nearness or proximity had to be expressed one more <em>upa</em> was prefixed 
to it. Thus, we see how tautological tendencies were influencing Sanskrit in the very hoary past. The 
Ramayana <em>upopaviSTa</em> has its parallel n Hindi <em>paas baiThnaa</em> [where] <em>baiThnaa</em> 
is <em>upa veshana</em> which itself means to sit near <em>upa= paas</em>. But still <em>paas</em> is 
used with <em>baiThnaa...&#39;</em> The Ramayana, A Linguistic Study, Pt. Satya Vrat. And to supplement 
Panditji&#39;s above saying, even in English this is evident and Oxford in saying meaning for proximity, 
says &#39;sat in close proximity to them&#39; where &#39;proximity&#39; itself is one <em>upa</em> and &#39;close&#39; is another
<em>upa...</em> Thus tautology is same everywhere.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>18. iti iva</em> = thus, this way; <em>shoka vidheya deham</em> = by anguish, subordinated [routed 
by,] with physique; <em>vi sanGYam</em> = without, sensation; <em>evam</em> = that way; <em>vilapantam</em> 
= bewailing; <em>tam</em> = to him; <em>raamam</em> = to Rama; <em>saumitriH</em> = Soumitri; <em>a 
diina sattvaH</em> = not, dispirited, in courage; <em>nyaaye sthitaH</em> = in justice, standing [justifiably];
<em>kaala yutam ca</em> = time, oriented [timely,] also; <em>vaakyam uvaaca</em> = sentence, spoke [suggested.]</p>

<p class="tat">
To such a Rama whose physique is routed by his anguish in this way and who is insensately bewailing 
in that way, Soumitri whose courage is un-dispirited gave a justifiable and timely suggestion. [3-63-18]</p>

&quot;Oh, noble brother, banish that anguish and brace yourself with fortitude, and let you be with spiritedness 
in her searching... indeed, there is no backsliding for spirited men in their enterprises in this world, 
even though the enterprises are highly impracticable...&quot; [3-63-19]</p>

<p class="comment">
Lack of fortitude and spiritedness will sink anyone in a chasmal self-centred subjective grief. <em>
anena dhairya utsaahau shokam apanudya kaarya saadhakau iti suucitam - tathaa ca bhaatate - droNa parvaaNi 
- abhimanyu vadhe dharma putram prati vyaasaH - shocato hi mahaa raaja hi adhame abhivartate | tasmaat 
shokam parityajya shreyase prayated budhaH | praharSham abhimaanam ca cintayet | evam GYaatvaa sthiro 
bhuutvaa jahi ariin dhairyam aapnuhi | dk</em> Thus Vyaasa advises Dharmaraja to have fortitude and 
courage when he was sinking under the grief for the merciless killing of lonesome Abhimanyu, the son 
of Arjuna, in Maha Bharata war.</p>

<p class="tat">
When Soumitri of towering bravery is speaking this way, Rama, the enhancer of Raghu&#39;s lineage, gave
