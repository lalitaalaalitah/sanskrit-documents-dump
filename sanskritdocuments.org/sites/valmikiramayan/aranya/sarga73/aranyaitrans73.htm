<p class="comment">
The word <em>viTapin</em> was originally an adjective of <em>vR^iksha, viTapi VR^iksha</em>, meaning 
a tree having twigs. In the course of time the sense of <em>vR^iksha</em> was appropriated [by <em>viTapin</em> 
] to itself and the use of <em>vR^iksha</em> along with it fell out. There is no more conjecture. Pt. 
Satya Vrat in &#39;Ramayana - A Linguistic Study&#39; and here twigs are <em>upa lakshaNa</em> for blooms and 
then, &#39;trees garlanded with its own blooms and twigs...&#39;</p>

&quot;Erst there were self-collected sages, the disciples of Sage Matanga, and at one time while they were 
bringing the forest produce as ritual paraphernalia, they were much wearied by its weight and they were 
sweating... and all of those earthbound strings of sweat-drops that quickly dropped from their bodies 
were wafted by air onto trees, and on them they reoccurred as strings of flowers, by the merit of the 
ascesis of those sages... oh, Raghava, since those flowers have emerged from sweat-drops, they are imperishable, 
indeed... [3-73-23b, 24, 25]</p>

<p class="comment">
The above wafting of sweat drops onto trees is as per Govindaraja. In another way, the sweat drops fell 
onto ground and from them trees grew up, and they flowered unwithered flowers - Then as they laboured 
through the dell / From limb and brow the heat-drops fell: / Thence sprang and bloomed those wondrous 
trees: - R.T.H. Griffith</p>

It is difficult to climb this mountain hence Hanuma airlifted Rama and Lakshmana to Sugreeva. Brahma 
purposefully crafted it, as the only shelter to Sugreeva. Its flowers are ever blossomy and fruited 
to feed Sugreeva and the other four monkeys in exile. Baby elephants are enough to keep guard for that 
mountain, then why tell about the capacity of full grown ruttish elephants. This prearrangement is owing

Vegetarianism of Rama</p>

<p class="comment">
Lakshmana&#39;s killing, dressing of birds and fishes, and Rama&#39;s munching them - is a heatedly debated 
topic in web forums of all sorts. Some commentators of Ramayana have totally contrived the above expressions, 
to give a touch of vegetarianism. Even when Rama killed Rohi animals as offerings to dead Jataayu, there 
also it is contrived to mean as some roots or tubers. When Seetha says to Ravana who came in the guise 
of Brahman friar, that Rama will fetch much meat and I offer that on cooking <em>aamiSam aadaati puSkalam</em> 
This also is contrived as some tubers and fruits.</p>

<p class="comment">
This pro-Jain, pro-Buddhist touch of vegetarianism is an enforced virtue on Vedic-ism. The only and 
real vegetarians of India are the Jains, and Jainism is a &#39;holier than thou...&#39; sect of Vedic-ism, for 
their hymns and <em>biija akshara-s</em> are nothing but the derivatives of Vedic hymns. But these are 
a fed up lot with the then overtures of the practisers of Vedic-ism, and cleaved themselves from Vedic-ism 
to form Jainism, and even today they stick to their principles of non-violence, even towards the tiniest 
ant. Then came this Buddhism, a &#39;peaceable than thou...&#39; sect of the Vedic-ism, for their <em>jaataka 
katha-s</em> and other teachings are nothing but the Vedic lore. This ism, though called a peaceable 
one, meaning &#39;unwarlike...&#39; has conducted many wars and is splintered manifoldly, only because of the 
overtures of its practisers, allowed by their patronising kings. There used to be another sect <em>caar 
vaaka-s</em> an &#39;intellectual than thou...&#39; sect, but they are termed as nihilists atheists, non-believers 
etc., and their literature is totally ruined as they used to colloid with theists, demanding to prove 
god, materialistically. These are highly sophisticated, well-versed in all Veda-s, debaters with utmost 
precision. These three ism are not called separate religions than Vedic-ism, but <em>a vaidika mata-s</em> 
where <em>mata</em> is not a religion, but a philosophy, viewpoint, a <em>darshana</em>.</p>

<p class="comment">
Any religion, sect, or a following when patronised by the local sovereign, acquires bullhorns and snake 
fangs and starts to invade others, keeping themselves under the shade of their patronising king. So 
is this Buddhism, and it attained its &#39;warlike&#39; tarnish by the swordsmanship of Ashoka, the Great. Besides 
spoiling its own original and peaceable tenets, Buddhism has equally spoiled the Vedic-ism, by the time 
of Ashoka itself. Even Ashoka has not converted himself to Buddhism overnight, but after a series of 
studies. He was a Buddhist before Kalinga war, but warred and massacred Kalinga, and a Buddhist and 
butchery - does not go hand in hand. By the way, Buddhists are no vegetarians, including Ashoka, but 
his edicts ask all others to not to eat meat.</p>

<p class="comment">
Even today verifiable are the dietary habits in the provinces where the preachers of Buddhism have gone 
or not sent, or rendered useless, say Bengal. The usual route of Buddhists of Ashoka&#39;s period is from 
Patna to Orissa, and to Andhra. And Andhra was stronghold of Buddhists, once when <em>aacaarya naagarjuna</em> 
was there, who established a Buddhist University in Andhra, to which students from far Japan used to 
come. Even today, excavations are going on and Buddhist edicts are coming out, around Naagarjuna Sagar 
dam. The other route from Andhra is to Sri Lanka, down south. The details about the itinerary of these 
Buddhists preachers, better call them as door-to-door campaigners of Ashoka&#39;s, greatness than Buddhism, 
can be found in their legend, the third <em>sangiitini,</em> masterminded by the mentor of Ashoka, namely
<em>moggali puttastha vira,</em> , someone like Gobbels of Hitler. And rampant was this pseudo-Buddhism 
in South India, much abetted by the then pseudo-Jainism, to where <em>bhadra saalastha viira</em> was 
sent on his way to <em>mahaa taamra parNi dviipa</em> present day Sri Lanka, headed by Ashoka&#39;s son 
Mahinda [Mahendra, and along with the sister of Ashoka,] besides, his <em>duuta-s</em> to the court 
Antiocus II Theos [grandson of Seleucus,] Ptolemy II Philadeliphus, King of Egypt; King Antigonus Gonatus 
of Macedon; King Alexander of Epirus... so on. Thus, they successfully propagated about Ashoka, rather 
than the tenets of pure Buddhism, and as a result, that Buddhism is corrupted, back home.</p>

Though Buddha said at his last stage <em>vaya dhamma sankara - appamadena sampadeta</em> &#39;decay is an 
innate feature in all beings, acquire your salvation unfalteringly...&#39; where <em>appamaadena</em> is
<em>a pramaadena</em> &#39;without, carelessness...&#39; But the later time overenthusiastic practisers decayed 
Buddhism carefully and unfalteringly in its homeland. In these times of Ashoka, the customs and habits 
of Vedic-ism merged into the then pseudo-Buddhism, and a commixture of Vedic-ism and pseudo-Buddhism 
resurfaced, and Vedic-ism became pseudomorphic Brahmanism. Along with it, the dietary habits have changed 
completely, and vegetarianism of Jainism has come to stay, and thereafter it just turned to egg-tarianism, 
and presently going on to hamburger-ism and pizza-ism.</p>

This being so, the orthodox Hinduism lays taboo on meat eating in respect of Brahmans only, that too 
by reckoning the eras, the Indian <em>yuga</em> theory. In <em>satya yuga</em> no distinctions recorded, 
in <em>treat yuga, dwaapara yuga-s</em> of Ramayana and Bharata times, Brahmins are permitted only some 
non-veg items, called <em>prokshita aahaara</em> as can be seen in Rama-Vali conversation, and sage 
Agastya bans ram&#39;s meat, that too only for Brahmins, after Vaataapi-Ilvala episode. In <em>kali yuga</em> 
non-veg is completely banned for Brahmins, not by scriptures, but by the impact of the then despots 
of pseudo-Buddhism. The <em>kali puruSa</em> is entered through Duryodhana in <em>dwaapara yuga</em> 
of Maha Bharata time, but somehow world is saved by Krishna and Arjuna. Now we with a sarcastic affection 
call that <em>kali</em> has entered through Ashoka, and <em>kali yuga</em> is the period dating from 
Ashoka&#39;s despotic days. When a state of topsy-turviness occurs to Veda-s themselves in <em>kali yuga</em> 
, where Veda-s are breathing their last at present, there is nothing to speak of dietary habits of those 
eras.</p>

There are many web pages saying or objecting that Rama is a practiser of <em>a himsa</em> not non-violence 
of Jains, but non-butchery of living beings. Valmiki never said that Rama is a <em>Buddhist Monk</em> 
or a <em>vardhamaana, tiirthankara</em> of Jainism, but depicted him as Hindu Kshatriya, and no taboo 
is prescribed to this warring class in eating meat or chicken. Yet the lamentation will be like this: 
&quot;Lord Rama, a great, divine exemplar of dharma and virtue for Hindus, himself apparently doesn&#39;t care 
much for vegetarianism and ahimsa...&quot; &quot;[Rama:] &#39;I must to lonely wilds repair, abstain from flesh, and 
living there on roots, fruit, honey, hermit&#39;s food, pass twice seven years (14 yrs.) in solitude. To 
Bharata&#39;s hand the king will yield the regent power I thought to wield, and me, a hermit, will he send 
my days in Dandak wood to spend.&#39; &quot; -- Ramayana 2:20. [Griffith, Ralph T.H. The Ramayana of Valmiki: 
translated into English verse. Benares: E.J. Lazarus &amp; Co., 1895. p.117]. It may please be noted that 
vegetarianism is different from non-violence and it belongs only to Jain tenets, and later to Gandhian 
principles, but not to Hindus or Buddhists. The meaning of the above verse is &#39;being a hermit I will 
abstain from food that inculcates <em>raajasa, taamasa pravR^itti</em> an aggressive, assaulting mood... 
where certain kinds of meat stuff cause an aggressive mood...&#39; and Griffith had his own metrical exigencies 
to incorporate all the subtexts and underlined meanings in those iambics. It is unclear as to why hairs 
are counted on eggshells, without grasping the essence of the epic&#39;s idea of eliminating vice, where 
vice is Ravana and his diabolic activities. Rama&#39;s character may not be taken as a meek, weak, bleak 
backbencher, but take it as a blitzkrieg assaulter, aggressive invader, that too only on vice. If he 
were not to kill an edible animal how can he create a holocaustic extirpator of demons in the last episodes 
of the epic, or shall he start chanting on battlefield <em>dhammam sharaNam gaccaami, sangam sharaNam 
gaccami</em> that too, to Ravana - needs to be explored. Firstly let us ask ourselves whether we want 
a Ravana or a Rama, whether they eat meat, chicken 65, or <em>biryaani</em>, or Italian ice creams.</p>

<p class="comment">
Whether Rama is a god or no god, he is the princely Kshatriya, and if a warrior Kshatriya subsists on 
tubers and fruits, and on other insipid food, we can imagine how grand his warfare would be. If Rama 
were to be a god, why God created a big fish that eats a small fish, why birds and animals of prey, 
and why a <em>niSaada</em> that kills a bird at the start of Ramayana. Hence, taking dietary habits 
as acquired habits, but not godsend or tabooed ordinances of scriptures, the meanings of these verses 
of Kabandha are not contrived to establish any vegetarianism. Incidentally, these are the advices of 
raw-flesh eating Kabandha and we do not see Rama feasting comfortably on birds, fish, or on Kentucky 
chicken, at Pampa.</p>
