Introduction</h3>
			<p class="tat">
			Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana enter the great forest called Dandaka Forest and adore the eminent sages, who are 
			in penance and hermitages in that forest. This canto is named as Aranya Kanda not just to show that Rama roved 
			over just forests. The forests, as per Indian tradition, are the treasure houses of knowledge, and they are 
			the ultimate in Vedic culture.</p>

			<p class="tat">
			Thus, until Ayodhya Kanda Rama&#39;s exile is in <font color="#B3003A">aaryavarta</font> , the place of noblemen, 
			from River Ganges to Greece. Now Rama is stepping into an area called <font color="#B3003A">janasthana</font>,meaning 
			people&#39;s place. This janasthana is the place where Rama eradicated certain negative aspects of the then anarchic 
			individualised dominions where jungle law was the only recourse and brought all of them under one roof. Though 
			people lived there about along with sages and demons as well, demonic influence is said to be predominant, as 
			per Ramayana or other Purana-s. These demons are narrated to be man-eaters, but not cannibals who eat their 
			own tribesmen.Recent discoveries revealed that the first humans were cannibals.</p>

			<p class="tat">
			The Science magazine reported about the excavations at Neanderthals Neander Valley, Germany. In the words of 
			Alban Defleur of the Universite de la Mediterranee at Masrseilles, France, &quot;The finding allows us for the first 
			time to demonstrate the existence of the practice of cannibalism by European eanderthals.&quot; It is not clear from 
			the excavations of Neanderthals, whether the cannibalism was practised for survival or as a ritual.And even 
			at Alveston in the western English country of Gloucestershire, recently found are such human thighbones, which 
			had been split down the middle to remove marrow. Archaeologists of Bristol University are saying that the evidence 
			indicated the victims could have been disabled and deformed people in society. They have been murdered and eaten, 
			and the radiocarbon dating suggests these finds are about 2000 years ago. This practice is attributed to some 
			underworld cults during the later Iron Age. That being the situation in Europe, in the knowable history, in 
			Ramayana that has happened in an unknown era, the rakshasa-s are narrated to be man-eaters, but not as cannibals.But 
			the accounts given in Aranya Kanda and elsewhere, in ancient India the rakshasa-s ate up humans neither for 
			their own survival nor for ritual but to exhibit their tyranny and their barbaric supremacy. They never reported 
			to have eaten their own clansmen, but have a palate for other breed. Hence it is not exactly cannibalism, but 
			a barbaric act to exert savage scare. This is what the sages advise Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana when departing 
			towards Dandaka Aranya, and indirectly suggest eradicating such a savage atmosphere in peaceful forests.</p>

			<p class="tat">
			When it comes to <font color="#B3003A">isms</font> , it is said that the whole clash is between
			<font color="#B3003A">Vaishnavaites</font> and <font color="#B3003A">Shaivites</font> or
			<font color="#B3003A">Shaaktaites</font> , because the raakshasa-s are invariably Shiva worshippers, where Vaishnavism 
			is a later development. All the raakshasa-s or demons [in fact the term &#39;demon&#39; do not suit them,] portrayed 
			hereafter, are ardent worshippers of Shiva, and have every blessing from Shiva or Brahma. It is an ethnicity 
			of its own which lived rich lives, pompous in attributes, wielded magical powers, and unabatedly performed anything 
			that is beneficial for them.Their riches and glory will be reflected in Sundara Kanda, which will be burnt down 
			by Hanuma, humbling this deleterious ethnicity, even before Rama&#39;s war with Ravana. Such an ethnic culture will 
			be portrayed hereafter, in constant conflict with Rama, and Rama eradicating each and every member of such ethnicity 
			that goes against any civility.</p>

			<p class="txt">
			It is said that Rama performed <font color="#B3003A">diina jana rakshana</font> in this Aranya Kaanda, Miserable 
			People&#39;s Protection and <font color="#B3003A">mitra jana rakshana</font> in the next canto Kishkindha Kaanda, 
			i.e., Friendly People&#39;s Protection. The janasthana is the unexplored area by the then people of aaryavarta, 
			where the raakshasa ethnicity prevailed and which certainly resisted any outside influences or culture, and 
			which is why they are called raakshasa-s. The word <font color="#B3003A">raksha</font> means protection, and 
			they protect their own culture and ethnicity, and if any outsiders to join them, they shall be subservient.For 
			e.g., Ravana does not tolerate the insult meted out by his sister Shuurpanakha at the hands of Lakshmana.Ravana, 
			though persuaded by Maareecha not to encounter Rama, does not listen to any advises but wished to abduct Seetha, 
			because he wanted to possess that beautiful woman, like all other beautiful, pompous objects like Kubera&#39;s wealth, 
			Lanka, the golden city and Pushpaka aircraft etc. Ravana even baits Seetha with queen-hood, if only she subjugates 
			to him, and all these dictatorial aspects reveal the pride and vanity of Rakshasa culture. But the term &#39;demon&#39; 
			used in paucity of equivalent term may not be taken to mean just as a wicked demon or a devil, but a powerful 
			antagonistic culture or ethnic dominions of Rakshasas, in Janasthana.</p>

			<p class="tat">
			Rama does much good in jansthana in wiping out those cultures of greedily dictatorial, magically overpowering, 
			and ruinous to other forms of civility. In fact this Aranya Kanda is not explained in vivid terms by the ancient 
			commentators, and if things are probed deeper in this book, Aranya Kanda, Rama did more social work than miracles.Hence 
			much can be explored into this Aranya Kaanda, the Book of Forest, in terms of sociological, demographically 
			and ethnological pursuits of Rama to establish one great orderly civil empire under one emperor, that is what 
			we call Rama Raajya. Further, it will be narrated that Rama killed these Rakshasas in thousands, which is objected 
			by materialists as how can an archer eliminate so many thousands of Rakshasas, with just a bow and arrows.It 
			may be remembered that Sage Viswamitra accords many kinds of missiles to Rama, after the killing of Tataka, 
			the demoness, in Bala Kanda.It may not be surprising for this generation to know that a single trigger can create 
			havoc of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and then in all its probability Rama also might have triggered in the same way, 
			with the missiles endowed by Sage Viswamitra.</p>

[3-1-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>aatmavaan</em> is the question Valmiki put to Narada at the start of the epic in Bala Kanda, as the first word 
of verse 1-1-4. The courage and invincibility are reflected in the opening verse of this canto, since Rama has to perform
<em>diina jana</em> or <em>sajjana rakshaNa</em> i.e., saving the helpless or goodly men, viz. in the present context, the 
sages. The sages are to be saved from the onslaught of demons, which requires, both courage and un-invincibility. Apart 
from the above <em>aatmavaan</em> normally means sagacious one.</p>

<p class="comment">
This connotes Vedic import in saying that Supreme is far beyond from Solar orbit. In <em>iishaavaasyopanishad</em> , at 
hymn 15, we hear the following <em>mantra</em> , hymn:</p>

<p class="smRS">

On looking at the rising red sun, the devotee is asking &quot;Oh! Pooshan! God Sun, nourisher of the universe, the trueness of 
the Supreme is covered by your golden disk like vessel, [i.e., your Solar disk,] slide it aside, for as a truthful and righteous 
devotee, I visualize [that which is beyond your golden Solar disc.]</p>

<p class="comment">
This is said to be the coming of Supreme into lower abode of Solar orbit from His Supreme abode, say <em>vaikuNTHa</em>. 
Now Rama and Seetha are passing through this dazzling Solar-orbit like hermitage, to present themselves before the true 
devotees, and even to eradicate vice on earth. This appearance is without any prayers from the devotee, as contained in 
the above Vedic hymn. God reveals Himself</p>

that yield sacred and palatable fruits, and with ritual fuels, and water vessels, tubers and fruits. [3-1-4, 5]</p>

<p class="comment">
The Vedic ritual demands three Fireplaces called <em>tretaagni</em> , three fires. They are <em>dakshiNa agni</em> Southern 
Fire; <em>gaarhapatya agni</em> Household Fire; <em>aahavaniiya agni</em> Invocation Fire. These three are lit day in and 
day out, symbolising that the fire in living beings has continuity. Wherever a Vedic ritual takes place the celestials will 
come to take their share of oblations and the celestial dancers dance thereabout in praise of the ritual. The oblation vessels 
are of particular nature and a long spoon is made of particular wood, to oblate clarified butter or milk etc., into the 
Alter of Fire. The deerskin is the prescribed seat for meditation. The sacrificial grass is the essential item of even in 
domestic rituals, symbolising that the human kind shall prosper like the interlaced and intermingled grass, where the starting 
or the end point is intractable.</p>

<p class="comment">
Indian archers fasten the bowstring only when that bow is to be put to use. Further there is a method described in <em>dhanurveda</em> 
as to how a bowstring is to be fastened to the other end of the bow. The Indian mythological bows are of six feet or two 
yards, in height. It is also a measure like horse length. The string, which so far is spiralled to the bow beam, is to be 
removed. Then the bottom end of the bow is to be kept pressed onto the ground with left foot&#39;s big toe. Then with the right 
hand the edge of the string is handled and with left hand the other end of the bow is to be held and crouched, so that the 
string can be hooked or fastened there. After fastening, the stretch of the string is to be tested [like the occasional 
testing of the badminton or tennis racquet for the tension of its gut,] by pulling and leaving it, so that it makes a warring 
sound. By this sound of the bowstring, which is a signal to the opponent, the opponent comes to know as to who is handling 
which bow. Then if the archer is going to beam out an arrow, he shall pull the arrow on the bowstring up to his right ear 
and leave it, <em>aakarNaanta prayoga</em> . Here, removing the bowstring from its fastening implies that this archer, namely 
Rama who is so far handling the stringed bow, for he is roaming in forests, and since he is entering the place of elderly 
saints now, unfastened the bowstring in all his humbleness to sages and saints.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
The sages rendered Vedic Blessings on seeing the rising moon to eradicate the darkness called demons, for Rama is their

<p class="pratipada">
Or, the sages have physically seen that object of their worship, Rama the virtuous one, who they are so far seeing with

<p class="pratipada">
Or, the sages rendered the Vedic Blessings on seeing the moon-like Rama emerging to eradicate the darkness called demons. 
But this Rama is having attributes like <em>ruupa saMhananam lakShmiim saukumaaryam</em> as visualised by the sages, as 
at verse 13. And to not to happen any untoward incident to this delicate, dainty, graceful young man at the hands of the 
ireful demons, the sages rendered Vedic Blessings as a precautionary measure, for the sages are <em>dhR^iDha + vrataaH</em>

their presiding deity of virtue. This is the rendering of <em>Maheshvara Tiirtha</em>.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>te</em> = those sages; <em>udyantam + somam + iva</em> = arising, moon-like - arising like the presiding deity of Brahmins. 
It is said in Veda-s <em>tasmaat soma raajaano braahmaNaaH</em> Moon shall be the deity of Brahmins - Vedic Scholars, for 
Veda is dharma, the virtue and the Vedic Brahmins are the preachers and practisers of that virtuosity. <em>yashashviniim</em> 
= glorious Seetha, for she is the principal cause in eradicating demons; thus, by finding such protectors who have come 
hither to ameliorate the difficulties of sage, the sages rendered Vedic Blessings. This is <em>tilaka</em> or also known

While <em>saukumaarya</em> is the delicacy, like that of a blooming flower. <em>suveSa</em> is a neat and tidy outfit or 
suitable outfit. Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana wear a particular dress, given by Queen Kaikeyi in Ayodhya. Those dresses are 
peculiar to themselves and not on par with the regular dress of hermits. This dress of these three itself is a confusing 
attire for onlookers, like demon Viradha, or monkey-chief Sugreeva, for these three do look like neither perfect sages nor 
perfect warriors. Even the demon Viradha scorns them in the next chapter, for the inconstancy in their attire and their 
wielding weapons.</p>

<p class="comment">
Here, Rama may be astonished as to why these forest dwelling sages eulogise him so much. The sages are not using unnecessary 
conversation and they are informing Rama what a king shall be, whether he is in the capital or in forests. The term Indra 
is an allusion to the &#39;Ruler&#39;. It refers to seven more rulers or ruler like associates of Indra, <em>ashta dikpaalaka</em>-s. 
It is said that:</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
aShTaabhir loka paalaanaam maatraabhiH nirmito nR^ipaH</p>

<p class="comment">
A king is made with eight aspects of eight rulers of eight corners of the universe. Viz., <em>indra, vaayu</em> [Air,]
<em>yama</em> Death-god <em>suurya</em> Sun, <em>agni</em> Fire, <em>varuNa</em> Rain <em>chandra</em> Moon, and <em>kubera</em> 
Wealth. When the earth is heading towards anarchy, Brahma is said to have created the king with one fourth of resplendence 
of each of the eight rulers. Manu Srmriti states as below:</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
indra anila yama arkam agneshca varuNasya ca |<br>
candra vittesha yoH caiva mtr nirhR^itya shaashvateeH ||</p>

<p class="comment">
Manu smriti also prescribes certain rules for the king called Vrata. Indra accords rains for four months to sprout the seeds, 
so the king shall sprout the people&#39;s hopes. Sun evaporates earthly water slowly and insignificantly so as to give the next 
rain, so the king shall collect taxes and spend them again for the welfare of people <em>suurya vrata</em> . Air pervades 
everywhere to enliven people, so the king shall pervade everywhere through his agents to watch out good and evil for his 
subjects <em>maaruta vrata</em> . Yama, the God of Time, has no friends or foes and ends the lives of any one at the end 
of their time, and so shall the king in according punishments <em>yama vrata</em> . Rain binds one and all and it is the 
livelihood of any living being, so is king to bind his subjects for a good livelihood <em>varuNa vrata</em> . Moon is both 
a pleasant one and presiding deity for medicinal herbs, so shall the king be pleasant to his people and keep their health
<em>chandra vrata</em> . Fire is fiery and burns down evil and the king shall be fiery to his enemies, either internal or 
external <em>aagneya vrata</em> . The earthly earth sustains scholars and stupid, wealthy and poor, prosperous and pathetic 
alike, so shall the king bear with all of his subjects <em>pR^ithvii vrata</em></p>
