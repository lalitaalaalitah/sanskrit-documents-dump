<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Seetha denounces Ravana's misdeed and challenges him to brave her husband in a manly combat, rather than thieving her in a mousy way.
She reasons with him about his propriety in abducting other's wives, in vainglory.</p>

sermonise this demon with <em>hita bodha</em> 'moral teaching...' thinking in 'his' shoes and
foreseeing 'his' annihilation. What and why does he care? And how does she bother for his
well-being? These questions have their answers in mythology.</p>

means to end her life, rather than to surrender to immorality. To indicate this 'character's mood' <em>paatra aucityam</em>&nbsp; of Seetha, all her opinions about
'somebody's possessing her' were listed when Lakshmana was hastened after Rama, though at the cost of Lakshmana's steadfastness in his duty.</p>

"Oh, unmerciful one, on doing this kind of misdeed to that noble-souled Rama you are incapable to bear up life for a long time like
the one who quaffed venom. [3-53-21b, 22a]</p>
<p class="comment">Then Ravana may say 'nonsense, these venoms, poisons, toxins... all these things can do nothing to me as I am immortalised, I take
you off to a distant place, come what may...' for that Seetha is saying that 'the lasso of the Time is very long, but its noose is just throat sized
and that noose is already noosed around your throat, called arm-length-sized arrow of Rama, already shot from his bowstring, called sting-like
Seetha, as I am his and only his... as such, inescapable you are, anywhere you go...'</p>
