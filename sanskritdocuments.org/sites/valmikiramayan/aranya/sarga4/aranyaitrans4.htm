<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 4</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">
Rama and Lakshmana come to know about the curse of Viradha. Viradha desires to die in then hands of Rama according to the 
amendment given by the cursing authority, and thus he will be killed and relieved of his curse by Rama, and his elimination 
of negative forces starts with the elimination of Viradha. At the time of release from his curse, Viradha advises Rama to 
go to Sage Sharabhanga, who can advise Rama properly. It is said whenever a superior being is approached, he shall not be 
neared empty-handedly. So, the elimination of Viradha, first act of Rama to safeguard the <em>diinajana 
parirakshana</em> in Dandaka forests is the gift that Rama takes to the Sage Sharabhanga in next chapter. This is not 
a separate chapter in Baroda edition. But in Gorakhpur and Eastern versions it is a separate one.</p>

<p class="comment">
The celestial beings are called <em>sura</em> and their antagonists are <em>a-sura</em> . There are many sura beings living 
in heavens and netherworlds. To name a few, they are <em>uraga, garuda, gandharva, kimpurusha, siddha, saadhya, vidyaadhara, 
chaaraNa, apsara, yaksha, guhyaka, bhuuta, khechara</em> and the like. Of them gandharva-s are amiable beings for their 
expertise in performing arts. The apsara beings are the divine courtesans and among them are four apsara beings of high 
order. They are <em>Rambha, Urvashi, Menaka and Tilottama</em> . These four are instrumental to Indra, to incite and allure 
sages from their austere penance, lest they may win over the ship on heavens from Indra. The present gandharva, namely Tumburu, 
in his courting with Rambha had belated his services to Kubera, the Chief Divinity for Wealth Management. Hence Kubera cursed 
this gandharva to become the demon called Viradha, but yet this Tumburu alias Viradha is the devotee of Goddess Lakshmi. 
The antagonists of sura are a-sura beings and all sorts of demons, monsters, etc., come under this category and they are 
not devils or Satan&#39;s stooges, but they equal the capabilities of sura beings. Prof. Ranade observes that &quot;Dr. R.G. Bhandarkar, 
in an important article in the B.Br.A.S. Journal makes the following interesting suggestion. The Sanskrit equivalent of 
the word demon viz., &#39;Asurya&#39; may here refer to the &#39;Assyrian&#39; country. &#39;Assyrian and &#39;Asuryan&#39; being philologically identical, 
the &#39;y&#39; and the &#39;u&#39; being interchangeable as in Greek...&quot;</p>

<p class="comment">
The simile of sun and moon is of some importance. It will not be clear as to, who is compared with Sun and who with Moon, 
unless some ancient commentaries are touched. Rama is compared with Chandra, the Moon, because, Moon will not travel without 
his wives. All the celestial stars are the wives of the Moon, and they twinkle before the Moon&#39;s arrival, in order to welcome 
him into the night. Hence Rama is suffixed with Chandra, compounding to Sri Ramachandra. On the other hand, Sun does not 
travel along with his wife, namely Chaya, the Shadow, but she always will be at his hind. We the living beings are in between 
the Sun and his wife Chaya. If we face Sun in the morning times, she will be at our back, and in the evenings, when the 
Sun is at our back, Chaya, shadow will be in front of us, reminding us of our lengthening shadow of life. Thus we are in 
between the light and shadow. The Sun is also called karma saakshi, [Witness of Deeds.] Our own shadow, shortens with the 
ascending Sun and lengthens as the dusk of our day or life increases. Hence Sun&#39;s travel is wife-less one, and Lakshmana 
is thus compared with the Sun, for he does not have his wife travelling with him now. And Lakshmana is another karma saakshi 
[Witness of Events] in the Ramayana. In another way of commenting it is said that both of them are said to be moon-like 
in their appeasing personalities and sun-like in their radiant valour.</p>

The Episode of Viradha</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
&nbsp;</p>

<p  class="tat">
The episode of Viraadha assumes some importance in Hindu mythology. It may be observed 
that Viraadha drops down Seetha, lifts and carries Rama and Lakshmana far away from Seetha, where Rama and Lakshmana kill 
Viraadha. <em>aadhyaatma raamaayana</em> which occurs in the&nbsp; chapter 61 of
<em>brahmaanmda puraana</em> also narrates this episode of Viradha as a one to one fight, herein Rama 
affronts and kills him straight. But in Valmiki Ramayana, Viradha takes away Seetha first and then Rama and Lakshmana, too. 
A question arises as to why the demon should snatch Seetha away and later carry Rama and Lakshmana to a distant place from 
Seetha. It is part of the scheme that Rama kills no demon or sinner in the presence of Seetha, including Ravana, for she 
is that benevolent one to all the sinners and pardons them if surrendered in faith at her feet, as an incarnation of Goddess 
Lakshmi. Our concern here is with <em>skaanda purana</em> , a Shiva Puraana, in which Viradha&#39;s episode 
is explained detailedly. The <em>skaanda puraana</em> puts it as:</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">so&#39;pi taam jaanakii~N dR^iShTvaa shiighra~N sa~njaata 
vikramaH | <br>
iya~N paraa mahaa shaktiH seya~N svargasya kaaraNa~N asyaa vibodho mokShepi kaaraNa~N bandhanepi ca | <br>
tasmaat 
imaa~N bhajiShyami diShTyaa praapta~N hi darshanam |<br>
&nbsp;iti darshana maatreNa vimuktaam augha pa~njaraH | <br>
bhakti yukto jarahaara 
eNa~N siitaa~N caitanya ruupiNii~N |</p>

<p class="tat">
On seeing Seetha Viraaadha thought, &quot; She is the Supreme goddess through whom heavens can be obtained by salvation and also 
release from the bondage [of demon&#39;s body ] On just seeing Her, relieved is this body cage, so with all my devotion, I steal 
Her .&quot; etc. Hence <em>vi raadha</em> meant to be verily, devout, like Radha of Krishna. When chased 
and hurt by Rama and Lakshmana, the demon releases Seetha, but carries both the brothers away. For this distancing Rama 
and Lakshmana from Seetha, it is said that Rama does not kill any demon in the presence of Seetha, for she graciously condones 
the mischief of the demons, if they are true devotees.</p>

<p class="tat">
Again in <em>skaanda puraana</em>, at the end of this Viraaadha episode, the <em>phala shruti</em> [Fruit 
of Listening] it is narrated as:</p>

<p align="center">
<em class="ItrSloka">yo viraadha vadha~N 
nitya~N shR^iNoti shraavayeti vaa |<br>
tasya paapaani sarvaaNi vinaShTaani na sa~NshayaH ||</em></p>

<h4 class="tat">
&quot; Those that always listen or let listen this episode of virAdha, all their sins are absolved, undoubtedly .. skaanda pauraana</h4>
