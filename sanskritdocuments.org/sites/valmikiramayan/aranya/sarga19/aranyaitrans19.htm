----</p>

<p class="comment">
Here, when asked by Khara &#39;who mutilated you?&#39; Shuurpanakha should have normally reported that, &#39;sons 
of some king Dasharatha namely Rama and Lakshmana did this&#39; But not telling so she starts her narration 
with an odd appreciation of Rama&#39;s aspects. Some of them are as below:</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>taruNau ruupa sampannau</em> Though they scarred her on her nose and ears she did not loose her 
heart for them. This <em>taruNau ruupa sampannau</em> is in accordance with Rama&#39;s aspect which will 
be <em>sadaiva priya darshanaH</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;the same pleasant persona at any time&#39; as in Bala Kanda at 1-1-16, 
as said by Sage Narada to Valmiki. This is the same situation with Hanuma when Seetha asks him to indicate 
some aspects of Rama so as to believe Hanuma. There Hanuma starts with <em>raamaH kamala patra akshaH 
sarva sattva manoharaH - sundara 35-8.</em> &#39;Rama is lotus-petal eyed one&#39; Further people in sleep, 
intoxicated or infuriated conditions, will speak their heart <em>supramatta kupitaanaam bhaava j~naanam 
dR^iSTaH</em> So Shuurpanakha who is also in a sleep like daze, she came out with her soulful feelings 
about Rama.</p>

<p class="tat">
This narration has threefold meaning. 1] Through the eyes of a lustful female; 2] To belittle Rama and 
Lakshmana&#39;s prowess only to extol Kara&#39;s pride; 3] To deride Khara&#39;s valour so that he gets incited 
to fight Rama and Lakshmana.</p>

<h3>1] Through the eyes of a lustful female:<br>
<br></h3>

<p class="tat">
<em>taruNau</em> &#39;came of age.&#39; <em>kanyaam varayate ruupam</em> Women&#39;s first criterion towards a man 
is age. But this wording is in <em>dwivacana</em> &#39;in duel number&#39; so it belongs to both Rama and Lakshmana. 
Then the question comes &#39;is she leaning towards both of them?&#39; Yes. She makes eyes at both. First she 
approached Rama, but he advised her to approach Lakshmana. Lakshmana in turn advises her to approach 
Rama, thus she got interest in both. This is as per <em>anyonya sadR^ishau viirau</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;those darers 
are similar to one another.&#39; Rama and Lakshmana may be different among themselves, but to the onlookers 
they appear as one reality. Further, she has hate-thinking for both of them also. She says that &#39;this 
situation occurred due to both of them&#39; as at 3-19-18. How can she fall after both at a time? She can, 
with &#39;either-or-single-or-both&#39; syndrome because she is a demoness, and unseen are such brothers with 
their glorious aspects, so far by her.</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>ruupa sampannau</em> &#39;their aspects are ravishing&#39; The syndrome is that <em>angaat angaat sambhavasi</em> 
&#39;offshoots derive parent&#39;s aspects.&#39; So Manmatha, the Love-God derived all his aspects from Vishnu. 
Then it is imaginable how much more that Vishnu might be in his lovely aspect. So Rama is with <em>niratishaya 
ruupa samR^iddhi</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;sublime features, endowed with&#39; that which can be borrowed even by Manmatha.</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>sukumaarau</em> &#39;delicate&#39; like flowers. Rama is said to equal a delicate flower. <em>asiita puSpa 
samkaasham</em> Rama&#39;s body itself is a flower that which can be cherished by all. Or <em>su</em> 
= excellent;
<em>ku</em> =of earth; <em>maarau</em> = Manmatha-s&#39; &#39;two Manmatha-s on earth&#39; Manmatha, is only one 
god of love and without any form or body parts, but these two are having excellent forms and are evident 
on earth before eyes as per the attribute of <em>kandarpa iva muurtimaan</em> &#39;he has a form like that 
of Love-god&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
Then her bother Khara may ask &#39;then why we demons shall hanker after some flimsy, fragile, feeble creatures?&#39; 
For that she says <em>mahaa balau</em> &#39;greatly vigorous.&#39; They have un-depleting vigour of manhood, 
which is what required by an aged demoness.</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> &#39;white-lotus, broad, eyed&#39; &#39;Their eyes are not like ours while our 
eyes are <em>samrakta nayanaa ghoraa</em> &#39;bloodshot eyes of terrible look&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
Or, unlike <em>tamo guNa udreka</em> &#39;ever persisting with stolid constituent of nature&#39; and unlike
<em>rajo guNodreka</em> &#39;ever energetic with sprightly constituent of nature&#39; -- their eyes are <em>
sattva guNa sampanna</em> &#39;serene with the pure constituent of nature&#39; Though Rama says that he <em>
aatmaanaam maanuSyam manye</em> &#39;in my soul I consider I am human&#39; but as per <em>shruti</em> / scripture,
<em>yathaakapyaasam puNDariikam evam akshiNii</em> &#39;though his outward aspect is hiding his real Being, 
his eyes are telling the truth of His supernal nature&#39;, hence Rama is other-worldly.</p>

<p class="tat">
Or his white broad eyes are comparable with <em>kshiira samudra</em> Milky-ocean, his abode, with its 
unfathomable depths, so is his heart.</p>

<p class="tat">
Or <em>mahaa balau puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> &#39;Great mighty and white broad eyed ones&#39; who by their 
great might annihilate vice and if the evildoer submits himself, their white eyes alone give salvation 
with a broad-mind. <em>sukumaarau puNDariika vishaala akshau</em> &#39;Manmatha-like, white, broad eyed&#39; 
</p>

<p class="tat">
If it is said that these two are Love-gods on earth, then it may be asked &#39;where are the flowery arrows of that 
Love-god to these two?&#39; But the arrows of these earthly Love-gods are their eyes and glances. The 
lotus is but one among the five arrows of Manmatha. Even Seetha under her direly distressed situation 
in Lanka says that &#39;gods, celestials, great-souls et al are sanctified with the look of this lotus-petal 
eyed one&#39; <em>dhanyaa devaaH sa gandhavaaH siddhaaH ca paramarSyaH | mama pashyanti ye naadhama raamam 
raajiiva locanam || sundara 26-41.</em> This verse takes its place in <em>gayatri ramayaNa</em> as its 
14th verse out of total 27 verses.</p>

<p class="tat">
Further they are excelling only by their nature but not by their dressings and outfits for they are 
just clad in <em>ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau</em> &#39;jute-cloths, deerskin wearers of&#39; Mahaakavi Kalidasa 
says in his <em>abhij~naana shaakuntalam:</em> says <em>iyam [shakuntala] adhika manoj~naa valkalena api 
tanvii</em> that, &#39;this Shakuntala is pleasant though clad in jute-cloths&#39; <em>kimavahi madhuraaNaam 
maNDananam na akR^itiinaam</em> &#39;nothing can beautify beautiful people&#39; etc. Though not adorned by any 
extra special ornamentation they by their nature are attractive, as discerned by sages at 3-1-13 of 
Aranya Kanda <em>ruupa samhanam lakshmiim saukumaarya suveSatam</em> as well by this Shuurpanakha or 
even by Ravana in part II of Yuddha Kanda, in 99th chapter 12th verse, who also extols these lotus eyes 
and the aspect of Rama on his first sight at Rama as <em>padma patra vishaala aksham diirgha baahum 
arindamam</em></p>

<h3>
2] To belittle Rama and Lakshmana&#39;s prowess only to extol Kara&#39;s pride.</h3>

<p class="tat">
Should Khara ask in fear &#39;who is that great-mighty one who mutilated a sister of a great demon like 
me? Thereby my fear is growing about my own existence.&#39; Then Shuurpanakha&#39;s reply is like this, in 
order to remove Khara&#39;s fear of Rama:</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>taruNau</em>&nbsp; &#39;youngsters, boys&#39; for his own father Dasharatha tells Vishvamitra that these are
<em>uuna Sodasha varshau; na yuddha yogyatam asya apashyaami</em> in Bala Kanda. Shuurpanakha that way 
tells Khara &#39;brother Khara... these two Rama and Lakshmana are boyish you need not care them, &#39; Further
<em>yauvane viSayaisiNaam</em> &#39;boys in young age bother more for enjoymentï -- they are bothered to 
enjoy life and are not yet fit for a war, so you can war with them&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>ruupa sampannau</em> &#39;just by getups they are brilliant, but lack in courage to confront you&#39;
<em>kanyaa kaamayet ruupam</em> &#39;girls cherish charming ones&#39; &#39;They fall after girls only with their 
charming aspects that are unworthy to withstand war, so you can war with them&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>sukumaarau</em> &#39;delicate or fragile, or flimsy,&#39; because they are sons of some king, grown up in 
palace chambers, unlike us who grow in ravines; and they eat nonsensically delectable food, unlike us 
who happily eat raw-flesh. So, wherefrom they can tolerate your bloodshot glances, let alone your arrows...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>mahaa.abalu = mahaa + a + balau</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;very, without, strength; very weak fellows&#39;;</p>

<p class="tat">
furthermore <em>mahaa abalau; 
mahatii rakshaNiiyaa abalaa yayostu</em> &#39;a lady, namely Seetha, is to be protected by them. She has 
become a string fastened around their necks. Then how do they, the sentinels of a woman, can fight you...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>puNDariika vishalaa akshau</em> &#39;paled, broadened, eyed&#39; &#39;Their eyes paled and wide-open awaiting 
the results of their scarring my nose and ears, and their eyes popped up in daze, then what can they 
do to you...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
Then Khara may ask, &quot;it is good you have said that they are hapless etc., but they may now muster up 
some army and fight me back then what?&#39; </p>

<p class="tat">
For this she says, <em>ciira kR^ishNa ajina dharau</em> &#39;wearers 
of jute-cloths and deerskin&#39; And furthering her argument she says, &#39;how can they afford an army for 
they themselves have nothing special to wear. That too one of those items, namely the jute-cloth, is 
begged from a tree that is sessile, and the other, the deerskin, is begged from a deer, that is mobile.&nbsp; They themselves 
are shuttling in between mobile and sessile how can they confront you.&#39; </p>

<p class="tat">
Further, this god, say this 
Rama, has no other special work or duty, except shuttling between mobile or sessile beings or matter, 
begging their produce, and beg them to recognise him.</p>

<h3>3] To deride Khara&#39;s valour so that he can be incited to fight.</h3>

<p class="tat">
Her words also extol the capabilities of Rama and Lakshmana in warring and said to have addressed Khara 
this way in order to enhance his self-pride.</p>

<p class="tat">
<em>tarunau; yauvane vijigiisuNaam</em> &#39;youthful ones 
are interested in triumphs&#39; &#39;Because they are the seekers of triumphs, they will definitely triumph 
over you, you better do not go there and get defeated&#39;</p>

Some mms have this <em>daanavau</em> 
demons as <em>maanuSau</em>, humans. While Khara, sending his demons to eliminate the brothers, says 
that they are just humans as at verse 22 in this chapter itself. So Shuurpanakha evasively told a lie 
to his brother that she could not distinguish between their own race and that of others. Khara for his 
part believes that neither demons nor gods can hurt his race.</p>

This last verse is mismatching with the episode. This is not found 
in some publications of Gorakhpur versions but found in others and even in the Eastern recension. The 
import of this verse is that though the demons have gone to Rama but they could not assault him, which 
actually happens in next episode. However this verse is also included here as per the text of Chaukambha 
Vidyaa Bhavan, Ksashi, and according to Eastern recension.</p>

curse of Khara and Duushana

<p class="tat">Maheshvara Tiirtha notes 
that God Shiva cursed Khara and pardoned saying that he will be released from curse by Rama of Dasharatha.
<em>tasmaadyaH 
kruura ruupeNa dehena harataa amR^itam | viShNur daasharathir bhuutvaa mokShayiShyati suvrata |</em> 
In the <em>sheSa dharma</em> of Maha Bharata in the discourse between Bhiishma and Yudhistira it is 
said that sage Yajnavalkya has three sons. They are Chandrakanta, Mahaamedha and Vijaya. These three 
Brahmans became Khara, Duushana, and Trishira by the curse of Shiva. The first one Chandrakanta is Khara. 
And the disciples of the three Brahman scholars are fourteen and they also became Brahma-demons, who 
are now being sent. On listening Shuurpanakha Khara came to know that Vishnu arrived in the form of 
Rama and thus Khara wanted to get release from the curse by Rama, and hence firstly he sends the fourteen 
demon-disciples, and later he and his brother also follow the suit.</p>
