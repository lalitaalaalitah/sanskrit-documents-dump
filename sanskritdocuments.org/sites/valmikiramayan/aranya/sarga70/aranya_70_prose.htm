<p class="txt">
Kabandha&#39;s overlong arms are cut off when he wanted to devour Rama and Lakshmana as godsend dainty morsels. 
Then Kabandha wishes to know who these two are and when Lakshmana informs him of Rama, that demon feels 
elated for his accursed state is over at the hands of Rama.</p>

<p class="verloc">
.</p>

<p class="tat">
</p>

<p class="tat">
On prying at those two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, who are completely stowed in the hangman&#39;s halter-like 
arms of the demon, and who are enduring within it, Kabandha said this sentence to them.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, excellent Kshatriya-s, on seeing me who am miserably famished, really what for you stay cool? You 
are the godsend gobs of mine, and hence now you are almost dead...&quot; So said Kabandha to brothers.</p>

<p class="tat">
Lakshmana who is possessed by anguish, and who is determined to wreck revenge on that demon, said these 
expedient and advisable words to Rama on hearing that demon&#39;s word.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;This scurrilous demon quickly hauled in you and me to his face level, and he will quickly take us in, 
therefore, we will have to swiftly hack off his lengthy arms at his shoulder level... Gruesome is this 
gargantuan bodied demon, and triumphing over just with his arms he has utterly devastated this province, 
and he now wishes to end us... Oh, king Raghava, killing the non-aggressive is tantamount to the killing 
of animals that are led into Vedic-ritual in its midst is despicable to the kings...</p>

<p class="comment">
The text varies with other mms. <em>kratu madhye upa niitaam</em> will change to <em>kratu madhye apa 
niitaam</em> in Maheshvara Tiirtha&#39;s version, then it translates as &#39;an animal led out of the ritual 
half way through the ritual...&#39; meaning that &#39;the animal unbefitting for sacrifice...&#39; And that is to 
say 1] an animal not prearranged and sanctified right from the beginning, but brought in the middle 
of ritual; 2] or, one that is brought for ritual which has to yield without being aggressive <em>pratikaara 
hiina shakti</em>; 3] or, <em>paryagni kR^itaa na araNyaam utsR^ijyam a himsaayaa</em> &#39;unsanctified 
or wild animals brought from wilds are to be let off, unhurt...&#39; 4] or, one that which is not at the 
sacrificial post - it is not to be sacrificed...&#39; and Lakshmana says addressing Rama as &#39;oh, king, you 
have to let off those beasts, but not this beastly demon who is aggressive and contemplating a regicide...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing all of their conversation that demon is infuriated, and then widely opening his ferocious 
mouth he started to wolf down both of them. Then both the Raghava-s are very highly gladdened as the 
demon is hauling them towards his eye at shoulder level, and as they are the brothers with circumspection, 
they instantly mutilated his arms right at their shoulder joints only with two swords.</p>

<p class="comment">
This compound <em>su sam hR^iSTau</em> is as per the text of Govindaraja and Maheshvara Tiirtha states 
this as <em>su sam vignau</em> meaning &#39;very highly agitated...&#39; agitated at the short time available 
to cut off his hands, before falling into his well-head like mouth. And this expression &#39;very highly 
gladdened&#39; is for the righteous advice given by Lakshmana, circumspectly.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then that dextrous Rama with an unrestrained speed hacked off the right arm, and valiant Lakshmana on 
his part hewed down the left arm that speedily. He that overlong-armed Kabandha fell down with mangled 
arms, reverberated the sky, earth, and all of the ten points of horizon with a cacophonous voice, like 
a black-thunderous-cloud. That demon on seeing at his dissevered shoulders on which the gushes of blood 
are overflowing, he self-piteously asked those two bold ones thus as, &quot;who are you...&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">
When that great mighty Kabandha is asking thus, Lakshmana who has prosperous characteristics has informed 
him about Rama of Kakutstha, an unremitting dynasty.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;He is known to people by the name of Rama, the legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty, and you know me as his 
younger brother, Lakshmana, by my name... Countervailed from kingdom by mother this Rama is bluntly 
sent to forests, and he is on the rove in great forests along with me ad his wife... A demon stole his 
wife while he whose leverage is like that of god is living in the unpopulated forest... and wishing 
to retrieve her we came here...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;But who are you? Your legs are broken, and your mouth is infernal, yet it is on your chest, and alike 
a topless, rootless tree trunk you are sprawling in the forest, how so, or, for what reason?&quot; Lakshmana 
asked the demon thus.</p>

<p class="tat">
But Kabandha is highly delighted when Lakshmana spoke that way, as the words of Indra came to his memory, 
and he said these words in reply. &quot;Oh, manly tigers, by my providence you are revealed to me... welcome 
to you... and providentially sheared are these shackles, called my two arms, by you...</p>

<p class="comment">
The arms, mouth-to-stomach, and another organ are the epitomes of mortals. A mortal does everything 
with arms and devours anything with mouth. <em>martyaa kartaa bhoktaa ca</em> Now those shackles of 
mortality are severed and he is ready for immortality.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, manly tiger, actually how this form of mine is disfigured, of course owing to my distrustful behaviour, 
that you may listen while I narrate it to you.</p>
