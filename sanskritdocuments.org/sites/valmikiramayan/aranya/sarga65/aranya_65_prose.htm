<h3><b>Valmiki Ramayana - Aranya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 65</b><br>
 </h3>
</center>

<p class="txt">Lakshmana pacifies Rama with reasonable argument in saying that, owing to the felony
committed by a single soul, the entire world cannot be put to arrow. But a humanly search is to be
conducted first to find him out, who abducted Seetha. If she is unavailable even after a thorough
search, then that which is appropriate to the situation obtaining then, it can be effectuated.</p>

<p class="verloc">.</p>
<p class="tat"> </p>
<p class="tat">Lakshmana on seeing Rama who is searing and careworn owing to the abduction of
Seetha, blazing like the doomsday inferno, twinned with the notion of rendering the worlds into
nonentity, kenning at his stringed bow, keen to blaze away entire universe, suspiring again and
again, and who is alike Rudra at the end of era, and whose highly infuriated persona Lakshmana has
not seen previously, became pale-faced and spoke to Rama with folded palms.</p>
<p class="tat">"Previously, you were self-collected and self-controlled and delighted in the
wellbeing of all the beings. But presently, slipping into fury you are discarding your own
disposition, which is unapt of you...</p>
<p class="tat">"Grandeur in moon, splendour in sun, motion in wind, and composure in earth are
perpetual and all this perpetuity is available in you, besides an unexcelled honour...</p>
<p class="tat">"It will be unapt of you to vandalise worlds for a single-soul's felony. It is
unclear as to whose combat-chariot is this, or by whom, or by what reason it is shattered with its
weaponry and paraphernalia... This has become a very ghastly place since it is grooved by the
hooves of ungulates and by the felloies of chariot-wheels, and it is wetted with drops of blood,
oh, prince, thereby a combat is fought and stalled at this place... This is just a solo-combatant's
combat but not among duo, oh, best articulator one among best articulators, I indeed observe that
no huge army is eventuated here, nor its stamp... It will be inapt of you to wish for wrecking a
havoc upon all worlds for an individual's wrongdoing. Why because, the good-hearted, good-natured
kings are they who impose tenable punishment...</p>
<p class="tat">"You are always the shelterer for all beings, for you're above all the good-natured
and good-hearted ordinary kings, and who can really deem the ravagement of you wife as an act of
grace... As no altruist can evoke indignation in a hallowed person who is performing Vedic-ritual,
honestly, these rivers, oceans, mountains, gods, celestials, and cacodemons too cannot evoke
indignation in you, because they are always gentle to you... isn't so...</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, king, it will be apt of you to wield your bow and search for him who abducted
Seetha, along with me as your squire and standby, and with the help of sublime sages available in
this forest...</p>
<p class="tat">"Let us search the oceans, rivers and forests, and even divers dreadful caves and
different lotus-lakes... Let us intently search the worlds of gods and celestials as long as the
abductor of your wife is unapprehended... Oh, Lord of Kosala kingdom, if the heavenly lords are not
going bestow your wife propitiously, rather after our humanly effort, then you may do whatever you
want, seasonably...</p>
<p class="tat">"If, oh, king, you with your traits of sincerity, solidarity, simplicity, and
scrupulosity are not going to get back Seetha, then you may you may put whole of the universe to
turmoil with the torrents of your arrows which have swift egress as they are with golden-handles
which are stuffed with eagle feathers, and which mirror up the Thunderbolts of Mahendra in their
trajectories..." Thus Lakshmana appealed to ireful Rama.</p>
