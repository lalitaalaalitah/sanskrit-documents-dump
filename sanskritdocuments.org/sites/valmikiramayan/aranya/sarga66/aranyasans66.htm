<h3>Book

<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 66<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Lakshmana reasons with Rama regarding the drastic action Rama is about to take in
annihilating the worlds. He says many pithy references in dissuading Rama. This chapter likens to
Bhagavad Gita, as its terse version.</p>

Sumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him. [4-66-1, 2]</p>

[4-66-3]</p>
<p class="comment">The comparison of Rama to ambrosia is noteworthy. Ambrosia is not self-useful
but it is manifoldly useful to every other being. If Rama is useful to all created, animate, or
inanimate beings, inclusive of gods, and the thought of that prime mover to destruct what it is
moving, is self-contradictory. Next, the prime object of ambrosia is to enliven but not to
eradicate, thus that thought itself is self-contemptuous. Next, the very same demons turned
destructive from day one, and now if Rama destructs everything, it tantamount to brand Rama to have
taken sides with demons. This is again a self-critical phenomenon of his incarnation. And so
on...</p>

"World's disposition is this way only, even if Nahusha, the son Yayaati, has become

<p class="comment">Yayaati attains heaven after performing many Vedic-rituals. But when Indra asked
Yayaati 'who is the best personality in your kingdom?' Yayaati, as a straightforward person replied
'I am the best in my kingdom...' Then Indra said 'Self-eulogisers have no place in heaven, hence
you return to mortal worlds...' thus Yayaati met with a mischance. Instead of telling as Yayaati,
he is said to be the 'son of Nahusha' which expression suggests disobedience. Once Nahusha made the
Seven Sages, the stars in Ursa Major, as the bearers of his palanquin and hastened them saying
sarpa, sarpa... where that word means 'move fast, move fast...' besides its general meaning
'serpent...' Then Sage Agastya curses Nahusha, 'be like that...' i.e., 'become a serpent...' taking
the general meaning of that word. Then Nahusha, though a renowned personality, for he is accursed
he had to fall supine as a big serpent. So Lakshmana is obliquely suggesting Rama, 'you may be a
god supreme... but it is in your realm... not on earth... on earth you have to behave like an
earthling... wrecking the system from within is meaningless... have some obedience to the set
order...'</p>

even Moon, Mars etc., planets are said to have emerged from her, and she is lone female in

Vishnu, and hence Vishnu has to incarnate Himself on her periodically, to ease her of her problems.
As such 'your weeping for your loss is subjective, while putting your other wife, namely bhuu devi,
Mother Earth, to suffering by earthquakes, storms, whirlwinds, twisters, and what not... is it

<p class="comment">Vividly: We cannot discern the rights or wrongs of any action we perform now in
this lifetime, nor we can recollect the actions done us in earlier births, to asses their rights or
wrongs. And they are indefinite and infirm, because any action we perform it ceases to exist on its
competition. And if we have not performed such an action in last birth, conducive to yield good
result in this birth, its fruition is nonexistent. Thereby we may perhaps muse over our actions
basing on the results occurring now. In any case, nonexistent is the fruits of action, may it be
right or wrong, if there is inaction. This is according to Govindaraja. He uses word a dhR^itaanaam
'infirm' for a dhR^ivaaNaam 'indefinite' and Tilaka uses word ca vartate 'also, happens' for
pravartate 'will be in existence' and in either way the meaning is the same. <font face=

<em>18. viira</em> = oh, valiant one; <em>puraa tvam eva</em> = previously,
you, alone; <em>maam evam</em> = me, this way; <em>bahushaH uktavaan [anvashaH] hi</em> =
repeatedly, you have said [you instructed me,] indeed; <em>saakSaat bR^ihaspatiH api</em> =

<em>19. mahaapraaGYa</em> = oh, great discerner; <em>te buddhiH</em> = your,
thinking process; <em>devaiH api dur anvayaa</em> = by gods, even, impossible, to explicate
[non-explicatory]; <em>shokena abhi pra suptam</em> = by sadness, obliquely, utterly, slumberous;

<p class="pratipada">
<em>20. kSvaaku vR^iSabha</em> = oh, Ikshvaku's, foremost among;
<em>avekSya</em> = contemplate / consider / count; <em>divyam ca maanuSam ca</em> = divineness,
also, humanness, also; <em>evam</em> = that way; <em>aatmanaH ca paraakramam</em> = your own,
valour; <em>yatasva dviSataam vadhe</em> = try hard, in abser's, elimination.</p>
<p class="tat">
"Oh, foremost one among Ikshvaku, oh, Rama, contemplate the divineness of those
immortals and their pure being in maintaining world order, also consider the humanness of these
mortals and their helpless susceptibility to pain, also count on your own valour that which can
annihilate the whole of anything... and then come to conclusion whether or not to annihilate
everything... but, before that try hard to eliminate the abuser, lest he may abuse many others...

"Oh, best one among Ikshvaku-s, oh, Rama, contemplate the divine valour you have
derived, also consider the human valour you have inherited, also count on your own innate valour...
hence, try hard to eliminate the abuser...</p>
<p class="comment">The second meaning is when 'valour' is taken as main principle. This verse has
another shade if the compound in first foot is read as, according to some other ancient mms: divyam
ca maanuSam ca astram aatmanaH ca paraakramam | where the word aatmanaH is replaced with astram and
then the meaning is 'you have missiles unknown to humans and you also have missiles unknown even to
gods, by the courtesy of Vishvamitra and Agastya, and you have your own valour, then try hard for
the abuser...'</p>

owing to a single soul's malefaction, hence, mark him... that malefactor and a malevolent of yours,
