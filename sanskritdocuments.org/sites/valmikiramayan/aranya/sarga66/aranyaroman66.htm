<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 66<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Lakshmana reasons with Rama regarding the drastic action Rama is about to take in annihilating the worlds. He says many pithy
references in dissuading Rama. This chapter likens to Bhagavad Gita, as its terse version.</p>

While Rama is bewailing like a forlorn as his anguish is scorching him, rendered impoverished with an inanimate heart as a high
passion possessed him, Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him. [4-66-1, 2]</p>

<p class="tat">
"Oh, Rama, as gods have reaped ambrosia after a prolonged churning of Milky Ocean, you are a reap of King Dasharatha's superlative
ascesis and even by his superior acts... [4-66-3]</p>
<p class="comment">The comparison of Rama to ambrosia is noteworthy. Ambrosia is not self-useful but it is manifoldly useful to every other being. If
Rama is useful to all created, animate, or inanimate beings, inclusive of gods, and the thought of that prime mover to destruct what it is moving, is
self-contradictory. Next, the prime object of ambrosia is to enliven but not to eradicate, thus that thought itself is self-contemptuous. Next, the
very same demons turned destructive from day one, and now if Rama destructs everything, it tantamount to brand Rama to have taken sides with demons.
This is again a self-critical phenomenon of his incarnation. And so on...</p>

<p class="tat">
"World's disposition is this way only, even if Nahusha, the son Yayaati, has become an egalitarian with Indra, writhe touched him
off... [4-66-8]</p>
<p class="comment">Yayaati attains heaven after performing many Vedic-rituals. But when Indra asked Yayaati 'who is the best personality in your
kingdom?' Yayaati, as a straightforward person replied 'I am the best in my kingdom...' Then Indra said 'Self-eulogisers have no place in heaven,
hence you return to mortal worlds...' thus Yayaati met with a mischance. Instead of telling as Yayaati, he is said to be the 'son of Nahusha' which
expression suggests disobedience. Once Nahusha made the Seven Sages, the stars in Ursa Major, as the bearers of his palanquin and hastened them
saying sarpa, sarpa... where that word means 'move fast, move fast...' besides its general meaning 'serpent...' Then Sage Agastya curses Nahusha, 'be
like that...' i.e., 'become a serpent...' taking the general meaning of that word. Then Nahusha, though a renowned personality, for he is accursed he
had to fall supine as a big serpent. So Lakshmana is obliquely suggesting Rama, 'you may be a god supreme... but it is in your realm... not on
earth... on earth you have to behave like an earthling... wrecking the system from within is meaningless... have some obedience to the set
order...'</p>

emerged from her, and she is lone female in planetary system capable enough to produce offspring, and hence she is regarded as the wife of Vishnu,
and hence Vishnu has to incarnate Himself on her periodically, to ease her of her problems. As such 'your weeping for your loss is subjective, while
putting your other wife, namely bhuu devi, Mother Earth, to suffering by earthquakes, storms, whirlwinds, twisters, and what not... is it appropriate
of you to make her suffer periodically, while you say that your one-time-suffering such as this one is nonpareil... or what... world's disposition is

"Indiscernible are the rights and wrongs of actions, and indefinite are the cherished fruits of those actions, and without performing

<p class="comment">Vividly: We cannot discern the rights or wrongs of any action we perform now in this lifetime, nor we can recollect the actions
done us in earlier births, to asses their rights or wrongs. And they are indefinite and infirm, because any action we perform it ceases to exist on
its competition. And if we have not performed such an action in last birth, conducive to yield good result in this birth, its fruition is
nonexistent. Thereby we may perhaps muse over our actions basing on the results occurring now. In any case, nonexistent is the fruits of action, may
it be right or wrong, if there is inaction. This is according to Govindaraja. He uses word a dhR^itaanaam 'infirm' for a dhR^ivaaNaam 'indefinite'
and Tilaka uses word ca vartate 'also, happens' for pravartate 'will be in existence' and in either way the meaning is the same. <font face=

<p class="tat">
"The great brains with their braininess are clearly comprehending the indiscernible, indefinite or infirm rights and wrongs of their
actions, thus they translate their thinking into action... and thus they are undertaking humanly possible action... but not sitting back, unlike
you...</p>

<p class="comment">The second meaning is when 'valour' is taken as main principle. This verse has another shade if the compound in first foot is read
as, according to some other ancient mms: divyam ca maanuSam ca astram aatmanaH ca paraakramam | where the word aatmanaH is replaced with astram and
then the meaning is 'you have missiles unknown to humans and you also have missiles unknown even to gods, by the courtesy of Vishvamitra and Agastya,
and you have your own valour, then try hard for the abuser...'</p>
