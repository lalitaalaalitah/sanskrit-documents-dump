<h3><b>Valmiki Ramayana - Aranya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 66</b><br>
 </h3>

<p class="txt">Lakshmana reasons with Rama regarding the drastic action Rama is about to take in
annihilating the worlds. He says many pithy references in dissuading Rama. This chapter likens to
Bhagavad Gita, as its terse version.</p>

<p class="verloc">.</p>
<p class="tat"> </p>
<p class="tat">While Rama is bewailing like a forlorn as his anguish is scorching him, rendered
impoverished with an inanimate heart as a high passion possessed him, Lakshmana, the son of
Sumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him.</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, Rama, as gods have reaped ambrosia after a prolonged churning of Milky Ocean,
you are a reap of King Dasharatha's superlative ascesis and even by his superior acts...</p>
<p class="comment">The comparison of Rama to ambrosia is noteworthy. Ambrosia is not self-useful
but it is manifoldly useful to every other being. If Rama is useful to all created, animate, or
inanimate beings, inclusive of gods, and the thought of that prime mover to destruct what it is
moving, is self-contradictory. Next, the prime object of ambrosia is to enliven but not to
eradicate, thus that thought itself is self-contemptuous. Next, the very same demons turned
destructive from day one, and now if Rama destructs everything, it tantamount to brand Rama to have
taken sides with demons. This is again a self-critical phenomenon of his incarnation. And so
on...</p>
<p class="tat">"Our father was an enlivener of all the subjects and that king was beholden only to
your rosy endowments, but he obtained godhood by your separation... this is what we heard from
Bharata...</p>
<p class="comment">Annex: 'You know that our father fought demons on behalf of gods and was an
ablest and an impeccable ruler... and you said that our father might deride you in saying: 'you are
a wilful disobedient, despicable and even that way a dishonest one, such as you are, fie on you...'
[as at 3-61-8b, 9a,] but when you resort to undertake still deplorable devastation of worlds, than
that of demons, what will he say of you...</p>
<p class="tat">"If you are unable to withstand this anguish chanced on you, oh, Kakutstha, then how
a simpleton and whose boldness is meagre can withstand it...</p>
<p class="comment">Annex: 'Kakutstha-s are the pure beings <em>shuddha sattva</em>, and you are
still purer, because of the speciality of your birth through some divine dessert given by some
<em>yaGYa puruSa</em>, a Ritual Deity, therefore you should have some divine endowments, if not
all, and why do you compare yourself to a commoner and bewail like this, instead of making humanly
efforts... and if a person of your stature sits bewailing and moaning, whereto a commoner has to go
in a similar situation...</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, first and foremost man, tell me who is uncaught by mischance, which mischance
will be catchy like fire-catch, and oh, king, even that, that lets up momently...</p>
<p class="comment">Annex: 'I am not imparting any maiden version of Bhagavad Gita to you in saying
that <em>gataasuuna agataa suunau na anushocanti panNDitaaH; maatraa sparshaH tu kaunteya shiita
uSNam sukha duHkhadaa...</em> Gita 2-11, 13; 'This that irks- / Thy sense-life, thrilling to the
elements- / Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys, / 'Tis brief and mutable!' but we are in
an era of action, let us undertake some action, rather than bewailing... all this is but brief and
mutable...' but think yourself, what to do next, in a human way...'</p>
<p class="tat">"If you are going to blaze away worlds with your radiance in your ruefulness, to
where the ordinary people in rue shall go for solace, really...</p>
<p class="comment">Annex: 'A farmer fences his farm to not to allow stray cattle to graze the
crop... you are an implicit farmer of this universe and you alone fenced this universe with their
respective protective areas or spheres, say stratosphere, troposphere and suchlike... thus you have
come here explicitly as a fence to this world, and when the fence alone is trampling the crop of
the rightness, who else will come to the rescue of that forlorn elements of crop, called the
inmates of worlds...'</p>
<p class="tat">"World's disposition is this way only, even if Nahusha, the son Yayaati, has become
an egalitarian with Indra, writhe touched him off...</p>
<p class="comment">Yayaati attains heaven after performing many Vedic-rituals. But when Indra asked
Yayaati 'who is the best personality in your kingdom?' Yayaati, as a straightforward person replied
'I am the best in my kingdom...' Then Indra said 'Self-eulogisers have no place in heaven, hence
you return to mortal worlds...' thus Yayaati met with a mischance. Instead of telling as Yayaati,
he is said to be the 'son of Nahusha' which expression suggests disobedience. Once Nahusha made the
Seven Sages, the stars in Ursa Major, as the bearers of his palanquin and hastened them saying
<em>sarpa, sarpa...</em> where that word means 'move fast, move fast...' besides its general
meaning 'serpent...' Then Sage Agastya curses Nahusha, 'be like that...' i.e., 'become a
serpent...' taking the general meaning of that word. Then Nahusha, though a renowned personality,
for he is accursed he had to fall supine as a big serpent. So Lakshmana is obliquely suggesting
Rama, 'you may be a god supreme... but it is in your realm... not on earth... on earth you have to
behave like an earthling... wrecking the system from within is meaningless... have some obedience
to the set order...'</p>
<p class="tat">"Which great sage Vashishta is there, who is also the priest of our father, he
parented a hundred sons in one day and like that they are all eliminated in one day by Vishvamitra,
for which Vashishta also lamented, but not for a long...</p>
<p class="comment">Annex: 'world's disposition is such, a hundred living beings may take birth on
one day and even die in hundreds, or thousands in one day... birth entails death... you ordained it
to be so, but when the problem has come right under your seat, you go on bewailing without
undertaking humanly effort... is this befitting...'</p>
<p class="tat">"This Mother Earth who is the mother of worlds and venerated by all animate and
inanimate, or even celestial beings, oh, king of Kosala kingdom, even she undergoes tremors and
earthquakes...</p>
<p class="comment">Mother earth is not only held as a mother of living beings on her surface, but
even Moon, Mars etc., planets are said to have emerged from her, and she is lone female in
planetary system capable enough to produce offspring, and hence she is regarded as the wife of
Vishnu, and hence Vishnu has to incarnate Himself on her periodically, to ease her of her problems.
As such 'your weeping for your loss is subjective, while putting your other wife, namely <em>bhuu
devi</em>, Mother Earth, to suffering by earthquakes, storms, whirlwinds, twisters, and what not...
is it appropriate of you to make her suffer periodically, while you say that your
one-time-suffering such as this one is nonpareil... or what... world's disposition is as such...
not even you can change it, lest it boomerangs...'</p>
<p class="tat">"Which duteous pair is the pair of eyes of the world in whom all the systems of
world are peremptory, though that pair of Sun and Moon are doughtily influential in this solar
system, eclipse draws nigh of them...</p>
<p class="comment">Annex: 'for a while you stop thinking that you as Vishnu are reclining on me,
<em>aadi sheeSha</em> the Divine-Thousand-hooded-serpent-recline-bed of Vishnu in
<em>vaikuNTha</em>, yon the <em>dwaadasha aadtya-s</em>, 'Eleven Suns' and numerous Moons of this
Universes... you are now right under the nose of this solar system, and on earth... and in this
solar system there is none supreme than this mighty sun, and mellowly moon, a pair of eyes of this
system, where one opens one's eye by day and the other closes that eye with his cooling effect by
night... and it is also said in Veda-s: <font face="Translit 98" size="3em" color=
"#B3003A"><span style=
"letter-spacing: 1.5pt; line-height : 115%; margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%"><b>aadityaat jaayate
vR^iShTiH - vR^iShTiH tato annam abhijaayate - candramasau oShadhi vanaspatau</b></span></font>
'Sun causes rains, rains cause food, Moon causes herbs and plants of condiments...' and even they,
they are eclipsed occasionally, for they are around the mortal world... and what if, your anguish
eclipses you, temporarily...'</p>
<p class="tat">"Even very great incorporates like earth and suchlike planets, oh, bullish man, or
even the gods, or even all corporeal beings, cannot get release from the predestine of Supreme
Being...</p>
<p class="comment">This verse is held as an interpolate or the problem with copyists, by the use of
the word <em>bhuutaani</em> twice, and even the last compound is said to be self-contradictory
<em>sarva bhuutaani dehinaH</em> or <em>sarva bhuutaadi dehinaH</em> Hence it is up to the
grammarians to decide. Some mms use <em>vedaaH</em> for <em>devaaH</em> in first foot, thus 'even
all Veda-s put together cannot transcend the Absolute...'</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, tigerly-man, we hear that whether gods like Indra et al., are ethical and/or
unethical, yet they too have the resultant agonies and ecstasies... hence, it is inapt of you to
fret thyself...</p>
<p class="comment">The last compound in second foot <em>na tvam vyathitum arhasi</em> is the 'theme
instruction' in Gita <em>na tvam shocitum arhasi</em> which again appears in the next verse. This
has a near psalm in The Bible: 'Fret not thyself because of the ungodly...' Psalm 37, v 1.</p>
<p class="tat">"Whether Vaidehi is stolen or slain, oh, brave one, it will be inapt of you sadden
like this as with any other commoner without tracking her whereabouts... Persons of your like who
are always equable in their outlook, oh, Rama, they will remain non-dispirited even if they are
undergoing desperate straits, and they will not just sadden like this... Oh, foremost man among
men, you ratiocinate in subtle pursuit, objectively and brainily, and great brains will comprehend
good and bad in subtlety with their braininess... Indiscernible are the rights and wrongs of
actions, and indefinite are the cherished fruits of those actions, and without performing any
action, fruits also will be nonexistent...</p>
<p class="comment">Vividly: We cannot discern the rights or wrongs of any action we perform now in
this lifetime, nor we can recollect the actions done us in earlier births, to asses their rights or
wrongs. And they are indefinite and infirm, because any action we perform it ceases to exist on its
competition. And if we have not performed such an action in last birth, conducive to yield good
result in this birth, its fruition is nonexistent. Thereby we may perhaps muse over our actions
basing on the results occurring now. In any case, nonexistent is the fruits of action, may it be
right or wrong, if there is inaction. This is according to Govindaraja. He uses word <em>a
dhR^itaanaam</em> 'infirm' for <em>a dhR^ivaaNaam</em> 'indefinite' and Tilaka uses word <em>ca
vartate</em> 'also, happens' for <em>pravartate</em> 'will be in existence' and in either way the
meaning is the same. <font face="Translit 98" size="3em" color="#B3003A"><span style=
"letter-spacing: 1.5pt; line-height : 115%; margin-top: 1%; margin-bottom: 1%"><b>anena praaptam
sukham duHkham vaa puurva karma adhiinam iti uktam - tathaa ca bhaarate - aaraNyake - yaani
praapnoti puruShaH tat phalam puurva karmaaNaam | dhaataa api hi sva karmaiva taiH taiH hetubhiH
iishvaraH || dk</b></span></font></p>
<p class="comment">Another way of declining the meaning is by ellipting the words from previous
verse <em>buddhyaa yuktaa</em> 'with braininess' as below:</p>
<p class="prati">mahaa praaGYaa= great, brains; buddhyaa yuktaa= with brain, having [with
braininess]; a + dR^iSTa= not, seen [indiscernible]; a + dhR^ivaaNaam ca= not, definite
[indefinite,] also [a + dhR^itaanaam= not, firm, infirm]; guNa doSaaNaam= rights, wrongs;
karmaNaam= of actions; shubha= rights; a shubhe= wrongs; vi jaananti= clearly, comprehending.</p>
<p class="tat">"The great brains with their braininess are clearly comprehending the indiscernible,
indefinite or infirm rights and wrongs of their actions, thus they translate their thinking into
action... and thus they are undertaking humanly possible action... but not sitting back, unlike
you...</p>
<p class="comment">There is another shade to this verse with some altered verbiage as below:</p>
<p class="smRS">adR^iShTa guNa doShaaNaam karmasu abhirata aatmaanaam |<br>
na antareNa kriyaam viira phalam iShTam pravartate ||</p>
<p class="tat">Oh, brave one, to those that are interested in endeavours, whether or not they are
uninterested in the results of their actions, either rights or wrongs, but even to them cherished
fruits does not occur, effortlessly...</p>
<p class="comment">And the commentaries go on expanding these tenets, till this chapter vies with
Bhagavad Gita.</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh valiant one, indeed you alone have said this way to me previously and
repeatedly, who really can profess you even he were to be professedly the Jupiter... Oh, great
discerner, your thinking process is non-explicatory even to gods, but now that thinking process is
obliquely and utterly slumberous owing to your sadness, hence I am addressing your percipience and
this is no schoolteaching...</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, foremost one among Ikshvaku, oh, Rama, contemplate the divineness of those
immortals and their pure being in maintaining world order, also consider the humanness of these
mortals and their helpless susceptibility to pain, also count on your own valour that which can
annihilate the whole of anything... and then come to conclusion whether or not to annihilate
everything... but, before that try hard to eliminate the abuser, lest he may abuse many
others...</p>
<p class="ItrSloka">Or</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, best one among Ikshvaku-s, oh, Rama, contemplate the divine valour you have
derived, also consider the human valour you have inherited, also count on your own innate valour...
hence, try hard to eliminate the abuser...</p>
<p class="comment">The second meaning is when 'valour' is taken as main principle. This verse has
another shade if the compound in first foot is read as, according to some other ancient mms:
<em>divyam ca maanuSam ca astram aatmanaH ca paraakramam |</em> where the word <em>aatmanaH</em> is
replaced with <em>astram</em> and then the meaning is 'you have missiles unknown to humans and you
also have missiles unknown even to gods, by the courtesy of Vishvamitra and Agastya, and you have
your own valour, then try hard for the abuser...'</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, best one among men, what is it you gain on performing a complete annihilation
owing to a single soul's malefaction, hence, mark him... that malefactor and a malevolent of yours,
and it will be apt of you to uproot him... him alone...</p>
