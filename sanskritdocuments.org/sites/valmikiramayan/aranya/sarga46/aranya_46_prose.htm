<p class="txt">
Ravana praises Seetha&#39;s beauty by extolling every limb of hers, though he enters like a Brahman sanyaasi, 
a friar. He indulges in a most untoward laudation that is unbefitting for a saintly and elderly almsman. 
Unable to refute him, because he is in such a pious garb, she had to invite him as an untimely guest.</p>

<p class="verloc">

<p class="tat">
</p>

<p class="tat">
Raghava&#39;s younger brother Lakshmana is very much infuriated at Seetha who spoke to him rudely, as such 
he journeyed towards Rama at once as though he is yearning to see Rama immediately, albeit his heart 
wanted him to stand guard to Seetha. Quickly taking hold of intervallic time then the ten-headed Ravana 
approached Vaidehi adopting an aspect of a sanyaasi, a meandering Brahman friar. That sanyaasi is now 
cloaked in smooth silky saffron, his head-hair is neatly tufted, sandals are wooden, umbrella is on 
right shoulder, and on his left shoulder a shaft of sanyaasi is shouldered, onto which his handy water 
vessel is hooked, and he proceeded towards Vaidehi in a mien of meandering sanyaasi.
</p>

<p class="comment">
There are many dress rules to a <em>sanyasi </em>&#39;the Hindu sanyaasi&#39; where the main items are, as said 
by Sage Angiirasa: <em>brahma suutram tridanDam ca vastram jantu nivaaraNam | shikyam paatram bR^isiim 
caiva kaupiinam kaTi veShTitam</em> &#39;sacred thread, three-shafts, saffron clothing, deerskin, handy 
water vessel, grass-mat, loin-cloth, girdle-cloth... by these he will be known as a real sanyasi &#39;Hindu 
sanyaasi.&#39; Out of all these items, the shafts make a difference. Vaishnavaite sanyaasi-s handle three 
shafts tied into one, and the three are symbolic to cit, acit, iishvara &#39;animate, inanimate, and lord...&#39; 
and on this Manu says <em>vaak daNDaH ca mano daNDaH kaaya daNDaH tathaiva ca | yasya ete nihitaa buddhau 
sa tridaNDii ca ucya te</em> the word <em>daNDa</em> means &#39;repressing, suppression, control...&#39; thus 
a sanyaasi has to control his &#39;speech, mind, and body... by that alone he is renowned as sanyasi... 
Manu. As such, Ravana is in the getup of an unmistakable Brahman sanyaasi, with an unbridled tongue.</p>

<p class="tat">
As with a pitchiest gloom overcoming the sunless and moonless lively eventide, that great-mighty Ravana 
came over to Vaidehi in that forest, when she is without two of the brothers, namely Rama and Lakshmana. 
As a sinister planet looks over Star Rohini when she is devoid of Moon, that extremely sinister Ravana 
then looked over the glorious and youthful princess Seetha.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Rohini is the principle star and dear wife of the Moon will be in lunar asterism of the same name, and 
when she comes in the view of planets like Saturn and Mars astrology predicts earthly havocs. Hence, 
Ravana is compared with such a planet and Seetha with Rohini.</p>

<p class="tat">
On observing ferocious Ravana whose activities are iniquitous, the trees of Janasthaana are not in full 
sway, nor the wind is in full swing. On seeing him who is seeing with his bloodshot eyes, River Godavari 
too is frightened and started to rush off quietly, whose onrush will be rapid otherwise.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The reaction of the trees, wind, and river is as said by gods to Brahma in Bala Kanda, at 1-15-10: &quot;Surya, 
the Sun will not verily parch Ravana. Maarutha, the Air will not surge at his sides. On seeing Ravana, 
the lord of the undulating, drifting waves, Ocean... will not pulsate either, and will hide the undulating 
waves, for the waves are his wives, and Ravana may abduct them... like Seetha.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">
In the meanwhile the Decahedron demon Ravana, who is all the while waiting for some lapse of Rama, neared 
Vaidehi in the getup of a sanyaasi. That disgraceful Ravana made advances in a graceful mien of Brahman 
almsman to Vaidehi who is thinking over her husband, like the slow moving Saturn making advance to Star 
Citra which will be ominous. Like a wellspring shrouded by grass, enshrouded in a decent getup of a 
Brahman friar, in a trice Ravana leeringly stood before of Vaidehi, the admirable wife of Rama.
</p>

<p class="comment">
This idiomatic usage of <em>tR^iNa kuupa</em> which draws upon straw, is held high by Dr. Satya Vrat, 
which is repeated often in Ramayana. He says &#39;Probably Kalidasa too was inspired by this very expression 
of Valmiki when he put it in the mouth of Shakuntala as she was being repudiated by Dushyanta: <em>ko 
anyo dharma kancuka praveshinaH tR^iNa kuupa upama asya tava anukaari bhaviShyati - abhij~naana shaakuntalam</em> 
Act 5.</p>

<p class="tat">
While standing before her then Ravana eyed at the auspicious wife of Rama, whose lips and teeth are 
fine, visage is shiny like a full moon, and who is presently tortured by her tearful lamentation and 
sitting in the straw-cottage, and he approached that lotus-petal eyed Vaidehi who is dressed in ochry 
silks, as that night-walker is gladdened at his heart for her solitude. He who is hit by the arrows 
of Love-god that king of demons Ravana, on seeing Seetha entered resonating the resonances of Vedic-hymns 
as precursory in seeking alms, and spoke these well-mannered sentences to her who is in solitariness.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Ravana really acclaimed her who is an excellent one in all the three worlds, beaming forth with the 
beauty of her body, and who is like Goddess Lakshmi but for Divine-lotus as Her settle, for Seetha is 
devoid of her settling, namely Rama. &quot;Glittering like the glitter of gold, silkened in ochry silks, 
you are like a lotus-tendril garlanded with divine lotuses as your ensemble, who are you?&quot; Thus Ravanan 
started addressing Seetha
</p>

<p class="comment">
The beautiful outfits on this lotus-stalk like Seetha are her <em>mukha kamala, netra kamala, kara kamala, 
paada kamala...</em> &#39;lotus-eyes, lotus-face, lotus-stalk like hands and lotus-feet and other limbs...&#39; 
The word <em>padmini</em> also means a &#39;lake&#39; besides the runner of lotus plant. The first compound 
is also read as: <em>raupya kaancana aabhaa</em> meaning &#39;shining like silver and gold...&#39; but it is 
in limited mms and with very limited use.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, rosy faced one, are you the personified numen of Respect, Renown or Resplendence, or the Felicitous 
Lakshmi herself, or oh, curvaceous one, are you a nymphal Apsara, or the numen of Benefactress, or a 
self-motivated woman, or Rati Devi, the consort of Manmatha, the Love God.
</p>

<p class="comment">
These three attributes are as informed by gods to Vishnu about the three wives of Dasharatha at 1-15-20, 
as: <em>hrii, HR^illekha,</em> virtue, modesty, uprightness... <em>shrii, shriikaara</em> affluence, 
prosperity and also suggestive of resplendence, radiance of that prosperity or effluence and <em>kiirti</em> 
fame, renown, glory... a <em>bhuuti, vibhuuti</em> is accordance, give-all, fortune. The ash applied 
on forehead in worships is to be applied with a verse <em>bhuutir bhuutikar iishvarii...</em> and for 
each of these attributes, a presiding deity is there with the same name. Here the <em>hrii</em> is also 
taken to mean <em>bhuu devi</em> &#39;Mother Earth&#39; another wife of Vishnu. The addressing <em>varaarohe</em> 
etc., are the attributes of the addressees as a beautiful woman in the group of: <em>varaarohaa, matta 
kaashinii, uttamaa, vara varNiniii - amara kosha</em> .</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Your teeth are evenly, smooth and their tips are like jasmine buds, and your whitish broad eyes are 
spotless, reddish at ends, and pupils are black. Your hips are beamy, thighs burly akin to elephant&#39;s 
trunks, and these two breasts of yours that are ornamented with best jewellery are rotund, rubbing and 
bumping each other, and they are swinging up and up, their nipples are brawny and jutting out, and they 
are smoothish like palm-fruits, thus they are covetable for they are beautiful. Oh, allurer, your smile 
is alluring, teeth are alluring, and your eyes allure, oh, beauty, your waist is palmful, your hair 
velvety, your breasts are jostling, and you rob my soul as a spate robs riverbank.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;I have not hitherto seen any earthly female with this kind of features on the face of earth; or, a 
goddess - no; a gandharva female - no; yaksha female - no; kinnaraa female - no, none whosoever! I marvel 
why an excellent one in all the three worlds by her features, more so, fragile and youthful as yourself 
should be living here in the thick of forest.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Such as you are you go back, let safety betide you, as you are unsuited to live in here, for this forest 
is the dwelling for ghastly demons who by their wish will be changing their guise. Delightful rooftops 
of skyscrapers, flourishing and richly fragranced pleasure-gardens of cities alone are meetly to you 
to saunter.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Oh, beauteous lady, I opine that only best garlands, best scents, best foodstuffs, best clothing are 
meetly to you, oh, lady with black pupils, hence it is meet and right to you to have a best husband.</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
Or</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Getting at you, the garlands, scents, foodstuffs, or clothing, they all become the best, because you 
are the best beauteous one, as such, he alone becomes a best person who gets you as his wife, and it 
is meet and right to you to choose such a husband, [aside: me alone.]
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, curvaceous lady, who are you? Oh, one with an impeccable smile, do you belong to Rudraa-gods, or 
Marut-gods, or to Vasu-s? To me you are beaming forth like a goddess.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Vividly: &#39;your kind of female is unspotted by me among humans, so you must be some goddess, but I have 
marked all gods and there I did not find you. This province belongs to demons. As such, gods, gandharva-s, 
kinnaraa-s and others cannot enter this place, let alone the gods from Shiva&#39;s side, because Shiva is 
the Ultimate for demons. If so, do you belong to <em>ekaa dasha rudraa-s </em>eleven Rudraa-s? Or, because 
Air can circulate here, do you belong to any of the forty-nine <em>marut gaNaa-s, </em>Wind-gods? Or, 
because earth has ancient connections with <em>aSTa vasu-s, </em>eight-Vasu-s, do you belong to any 
one of them?&#39; Further, Seetha is not smiling throughout this chapter as her mind is set on her husband&#39;s 
safety. Nevertheless Ravana assumes that if Seetha smiles, that smile will be impeccable.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;This is the dwelling-place of demons, and no goddess, nor a gandharva, nor a kinnara can arrive here, 
but how you have come here? Here, simians, lions, leopards, tigers, likewise other predators, bears, 
tigers, vultures will be moving. How you are not frightened from them? Being alone in this forest, oh, 
lady with a lovely face, how you are unafraid of horrendous and mighty elephants possessed of rut?
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, auspicious lady, who are you? Whose are you? Also from where are you? And being lonely, what for 
you are moving in dreadful Dandaka forest that is adored by demons?&quot; Thus Ravana spoke to Seetha.
</p>

<p class="tat">
When the wicked minded Ravana praised her in this way, Vaidehi the princess from Mithila has seen him 
who has arrived in the getup of Brahman and started to revere him with all the respects affordable to 
a casual guest.
</p>

<p class="tat">
She firstly fetched a seat him, then invited him with water for feet-wash, and then said to him who 
looked gracious in his bearing, &#39;alms are ready.&#39;
</p>

<p class="tat">
Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, 
and finding no reason to refute him flatly, as he has come like a Brahman, she invited him as a Brahman.</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
Or</p>

<p class="tat">
Maithili explored him who arrived with the features of a Brahman, with a saffron-robe and alms-bowl, 
and as he came with an unimperilling appearance of a Brahman, she invited him as she would ordinarily 
invite a real Brahman. [3-46-35]</p>

<p class="comment">
Did she recognise Ravana as a pseudo-Brahman or not... is the doubt raised by this verse, because different 
texts use different compounds <em>apaaya a darshanam.... upaaya a darshanam </em>etc. It is concluded 
that she, for sure, identified him as a pseudo-Brahman, because she has seen many such <em>sanyasi</em>-s 
while she was in Mithila. Hence she is said here as <em>Maithili </em>because she hails from Mithila 
and her father&#39;s court was full with these <em>sanyasi-s, yati-s, parivraajaka-s. </em>Then it is questioned 
as to why she invited him, though recognised him as a pseudo-Brahman. For this Govindaraja says: <em>
kaaSaaya daNDa maatreNa yatiH puujyo na samshayaH | </em>&#39;By spotting the saffron robe alone, a <em>
sanyasi </em>is venerable...&#39;
</p>

<p class="comment">
Then, another doubt is raised as to how she noticed him to be pseudo-<em> sanyasi </em>. For this it 
is said <em>raatri advaanam yaanam ca strii kathaa laulyam eva ca | mancakam shukla vastram yatiinaam 
patanaani SaT || </em>&#39;Meandering during night, using vehicles, showing interest in episodes relating 
to women, and relations with women, using a cot to sleep, wearing white cloths... these six show the 
downfall of his sanyaasi-hood...&#39; Ravana is indulged in <em>strii kathaa </em>in the whole of this chapter, 
in admiring at her lips, breasts, thighs etc., and no usual <em>swasti vacana, shubha aashiis </em>&#39;blessings...&#39; 
are uttered by him and thus Seetha could discern him to be a pseudo-<em> sanyasi. </em>
</p>

<p class="comment">
Though knowing him as such, why should she revere him at all, is another question. What else she could 
do as his appearance itself is <em>uddveSTum a+shakyam </em>&#39;irrefutable appearance of a Brahman <em>
sanyasi</em>...&#39; hence, somehow some time is to be gained until the arrival of Rama or Lakshmana. Otherwise, 
this pseudo-<em>sanyasi</em> may cause any pseudo-problem that she cannot solve. For this, the reply 
is at the word in the last verse <em>haritam dadarsha... </em>&#39;only greenery is seen by her not Rama 
nor Lakshmana...&#39; And in the next verse itself she is addressing him as a &quot;Brahman...&#39; but not with 
the titles like<em> sanyasi or yatiishvara, paramahamsa, parivraajaka </em>etc. A Brahman alone is eligible 
to take up <em>sanyaasa </em>&#39;Hindu-sanyaasi-hood...&#39; not Kshatriya or others. Hence, she concluded 
him to be Brahman. When once the sanyaasi-hood is taken he is no more a Brahman and his bodily being 
neutralises in the Absolute, and such a sanyaasi shall drag on his body, without comfortable bodily 
needs, until his natural death. But Seetha is addressing him contrary to his stance.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Brahman, this is the Darbha-grass-seat and you be seated comfortably, here is water, receive it 
for hand and feet wash, here is the forest grown victuals for your sake... dine on them relaxedly...&quot; 
Thus Seetha said to Ravana.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Ravana thoroughly observed that wife of the king, Maithili, when she invited him talking civilities 
contextual in inviting a guest, that too Brahman sanyasi, and he firmed up his mind to abduct her even 
forcibly, and started to dedicate himself for destruction.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Then she looked forward for her shapely husband who has gone on a hunting game, and who must be returning 
along with Lakshmana, and though she looked intently she could only see the green backdrop of that great 
forest, but not Rama or Lakshmana.</p>
