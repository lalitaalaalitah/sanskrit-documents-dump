<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 46<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana praises Seetha's beauty by extolling every limb of hers, though he enters like a Brahman sanyaasi, a friar. He indulges in a
most untoward laudation that is unbefitting for a saintly and elderly almsman. Unable to refute him, because he is in such a pious garb, she had to
invite him as an untimely guest.</p>

in a mien of meandering sanyaasi. [3-46-3, 4a]</p>
<p class="comment">There are many dress rules to a <em>sanyasi </em>&#39;the Hindu sanyaasi&#39; where the main items are, as said by Sage 
Angiirasa: <em>brahma suutram 
tridanDam ca vastram jantu nivaaraNam | shikyam paatram bR^isiim caiva kaupiinam kaTi veShTitam</em> 
&#39;sacred thread, three-shafts, saffron clothing, deerskin, handy water vessel, grass-mat, loin-cloth, 
girdle-cloth... by these he will be known as a real sanyasi &#39;Hindu sanyaasi.&#39; Out of all these items, 
the shafts make a difference. Vaishnavaite sanyaasi-s handle three shafts tied into one, and the three 
are symbolic to cit, acit, iishvara &#39;animate, inanimate, and lord...&#39; and on this Manu says
<em>vaak daNDaH 
ca mano daNDaH kaaya daNDaH tathaiva ca | yasya ete nihitaa buddhau sa tridaNDii ca ucya te</em> 
the word <em>daNDa</em> means &#39;repressing, suppression, control...&#39; thus a sanyaasi has to control his &#39;speech, 
mind, and body... by that alone he is renowned as sanyasi... Manu. As such, Ravana is in the getup of 
an unmistakable Brahman sanyaasi, with an unbridled tongue.</p>

<p class="comment">This idiomatic usage of <em>tR^iNa kuupa</em> which draws upon straw, is held high by Dr. Satya Vrat, which is

<p class="comment">
Did she recognise Ravana as a pseudo-Brahman or not... is the doubt raised by this verse, because 
different texts use different compounds <em>apaaya a darshanam.... upaaya a darshanam </em>etc. It 
is concluded that she, for sure, identified him as a pseudo-Brahman, because she has seen many such
<em>sanyasi</em>-s while she was in Mithila. Hence she is said here as <em>Maithili </em>because she 
hails from Mithila and her father&#39;s court was full with these <em>sanyasi-s, yati-s, parivraajaka-s.
</em>Then it is questioned as to why she invited him, though recognised him as a pseudo-Brahman. For 
this Govindaraja says: <em>kaaSaaya daNDa maatreNa yatiH 
puujyo na samshayaH | </em>&#39;By spotting the saffron robe alone, a <em>sanyasi </em>is venerable...&#39;
</p>

<p class="comment">
Then, another doubt is raised as to how she noticed him to be pseudo-<em> sanyasi </em>. For this it 
is said <em> raatri advaanam yaanam ca 

strii kathaa laulyam eva ca | mancakam shukla vastram yatiinaam patanaani SaT || </em>&#39;Meandering during night, using vehicles, showing interest in episodes relating to women, and 
relations with women, using a cot to sleep, wearing white cloths... these six show the downfall of 
his sanyaasi-hood...&#39; Ravana is indulged in <em>strii kathaa </em>in the whole of this chapter, in 
admiring at her lips, breasts, thighs etc., and no usual <em>swasti vacana, shubha aashiis </em>
&#39;blessings...&#39; are uttered by him and thus Seetha could discern him to be a pseudo-<em> sanyasi.
</em>
</p>

<p class="comment">
Though knowing him as such, why should she revere him at all, is another question. What else she 
could do as his appearance itself is <em>uddveSTum a+shakyam </em>&#39;irrefutable appearance of a 
Brahman <em>sanyasi</em>...&#39; hence, somehow some time is to be gained until the arrival of Rama or 
Lakshmana. Otherwise, this pseudo-<em>sanyasi</em> may cause any pseudo-problem that she cannot 
solve. For this, the reply is at the word in the last verse <em>haritam dadarsha... </em>&#39;only 
greenery is seen by her not Rama nor Lakshmana...&#39; And in the next verse itself she is addressing 
him as a &quot;Brahman...&#39; but not with the titles like<em> sanyasi or yatiishvara, paramahamsa, 
parivraajaka </em>etc. A Brahman alone is eligible to take up <em>sanyaasa </em>
&#39;Hindu-sanyaasi-hood...&#39; not Kshatriya or others. Hence, she concluded him to be Brahman. When once 
the sanyaasi-hood is taken he is no more a Brahman and his bodily being neutralises in the Absolute, 
and such a sanyaasi shall drag on his body, without comfortable bodily needs, until his natural 
death. But Seetha is addressing him contrary to his stance.</p>
