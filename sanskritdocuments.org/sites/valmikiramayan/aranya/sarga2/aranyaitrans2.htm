  <h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - Forest Treck<br></h3>

  <h3>Chapter [Sarga] 2<br>
	Verses converted to UTF-8, Sep, 09</h3>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p class="txt">
 Viradha the demon confronts Rama and other and tries to abduct Seetha, and
          then Rama. The killing of this Viradha is the first act of Rama in eliminating negative
          forces in his empire to establish Rama Raajya. This killing is also a gift to Sage
          Sharabhanga, whom he meets later, as per the meaning of verse I-1-41 of Samkshepa
          Ramayana contained in Bala Kanda. Rama thus started to act freeing the saints and sages
          in forests, and the forests themselves, from the cruelties of demons. Viradha is a demon
          by curse and a devotee Goddess Lakshmi, now incarnate as Seetha. Hence this demon wanted
          to own his goddess and hence lifts Seetha into his hands to abduct her away from Rama.
          But Rama and Lakshmana overpower and eliminate him, rescuing not only Seetha, but also
          other saints and sages living thereabout.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 This demon Viradha could not comprehend their identity prima facie. By their
  physique and carrying the bows and arrows, knives etc., they look like warriors. By their dress,
  hairdo, pendants etc., they look like sages. He has so far not seen a warring sage, like Bhargava
  Rama or Parashu Rama. These two men dressed like sages but look like warriors and are moving in
  the deadly forests with a wife. <em>vi raadha</em> , means without, love, a loveless one, and in
  another context it means that <em>vi</em> = verily, <em>raadha</em> adoring Krishna like Raadha.
  He is said to adore Goddess Lakshmi before he is cursed to become a demon, and finding that
  goddess in Seetha, he lifts her into his arms, like a baby. This demon while admonishing Rama and
  Lakshmana for flaunting the sainthood, for they are moving with weapons and a wife, he narrates
  about himself in next verses.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 Here Viradha said that Seetha would become his <em>
 bhaaryaa</em>
  which would
  translate into a 'wife' in routine manner. It is said that Viradha is a devotee of Goddess
  Lakshmi and it is not congruous for a devotee to say like that. Here, <em>aascharya
  ramayana</em>, another version of Ramayana, defines <em>bhaarya</em> as: <em>bhaa</em> luminous
  one; <em>aryaaH</em> adorable. Hence his word should mean, "this luminary is my adorable one."
  Further he handles Seetha like a baby, as in 3-2-16, she is said to be <em>viraadha anka
  gata</em> , gone into the arm-fold of Viradha as babies would. The peevish ones like Viradha or
  Ravana grab her very quickly for she is Goddess Lakshmi, the presiding deity of wealth.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 Here Rama says that 'my' kingdom is grabbed away, and now the grabbing away of
  Seetha is more painful, even somebody touching Seetha, the most. Rama did not loose heart to
  regain his kingdom. He underwent the course of what his father ordered and is definite of return
  to Ayodhya to rule back his empire. In the next canto Kishkindha, Vali the monkey hero questions
  Rama, as who he is to enter Kishkindha. To that Rama replies, "All the Bharata continent belongs
  to us, the Ikshwaku-s, and presently the emperor is Bharata, and hence on behalf of my emperor
  Bharata I slay you." There he is again confident of returning to capital after completing his
  exile. Hence claiming this kingdom as 'my' kingdom does not alter his status of emperor, though
  not now, but after the completion of exile he is to become one. Again Rama weighed the agony in
  terms of his father's death and grabbing away of his kingdom. Raajya Lakshmi, Kingdom Wealth is
  nothing before his wife, Wealth of Fortune, i.e. Bhaagya Lakshmi. Hence Rama is more bothered
  about his fortune wife than the retrievable kingdom, or the death of an aged father.</p>

  his anger hissing like a forestalled snake. [3-2-22]</p>

  <p class="comment">
 Such portrayal of Lakshmana as a fundamentally angry person, like a hissing
  snake, and a sharp tongued one etc., are attributed in mythology to the serpentine character of
  <em>aadi SheSa</em>, the thousand headed serpent on which Vishnu reclines. The mythological
  derivation is that Lakshmana is the incarnation of that serpent, while Bharata and Shatrughna are
  the incarnations of the conch shell and disc that adorn the two upper hands of Vishnu.</p>

  Dandaka aranya -Dandaka Forest </p>

	<p class="ItrSloka">
  &nbsp;</p>
 

  <p class="tat">The forest
  Dandaka Forest wherein Rama is trekking is a dominion of their kingdom, but a deserted forest.
  One named Danda, the last son of Ikshvaku, was performing all demonic activities in their
  kingdom. His father Ikshvaku received many a complaint about Danda's deeds from his subjects, and
  angered at his erring son Danda and banishes him from the kingdom.</p>

  <p class="tat">Danda took refuge
  in Vindhya mountain range and built a kingdom and a beautiful capital for himself called
  Madhumanta. He rubbed shoulders with all the demons thereabout and thus became a disciple of Sage
  Shukraachaarya, the guru of demons. One day when Sage Shukraachaarya is not in hermitage, Danda
  reaches there, and sees Araja, the elder daughter of the sage Shukra, and molests her, in spite
  of her repeated protests. Later when Sage Shukraachaarya comes to know about it, gets enraged and
  curses Danda, to fall down along with his entire kingdom under a mud storm around that Madhumanta
  capital for a period of seven consecutive days.</p>

  <p class="tat">Then there is a
  mud storm for seven days and entire kingdom went under mud, later to become a forest called
  Dandaka. The place to where the curse fearing people fled from that Madhunata to further south is
  called Jansthaana. At later time, when Rama's peregrination started, these two places, Dandaka
  forest and Janasthaana, are under the domain of Ravana, and Ravana made one demon named Khara, as
  the protector of this dominion Jansthaana.</p>

  <p class="tat">This is the place
  where Rama built his hermitage Panchavati, at which Demoness Surpanakha arrives, and from where
  Ravana abducts Seetha. When Rama asks the forest dwelling sages for a quiet place to live on, the
  sages in Dandaka forest, will make Rama constantly move southward, till he reaches Janasthana,
  indirectly directing Rama to eradicate the demonic influence over these places, which once
  belonged to Rama's kingdom.</p>
