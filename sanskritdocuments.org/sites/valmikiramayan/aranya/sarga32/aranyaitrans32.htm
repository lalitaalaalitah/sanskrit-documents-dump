<p class="comment">
The place where Ravana is sitting can be said as &#39;at the top floor of a multi-storeyed building...&#39; 
as the word <em>vimaana</em> means &#39;atop...&#39; of a house, temple-towers etc. But it can also be said Pushpaka 
aircraft as said in Dharmaakuutam: <em>tatra 
ca vicitra vimaana madhyage kaancana maya aasane - -</em></p>

<p class="comment">
The words <em>upa upa viSTa</em> &#39;the ministers are sitting near him, and are in attendance upon him...&#39; by the 
use of extra preposition <em>upa</em>, but in the course of time the idea of &#39;nearness or proximity&#39; are lost 
and it came be used as just &#39;sitting...&#39; Thus, the tautological tendencies were influencing Sanskrit&#39;

<p class="comment">Ravana is seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden Fire-altar, laid with golden
bricks. Mud-bricks will be used in Vedic-rituals in ordinary fashion, while he is a special fire in a special golden altar. When much ghee is poured
into that Golden-Fire-Altar continually, it is natural for the fire to blurt up, so also Ravana is flaring up when his needs are oblated in that
fire, and his glow is heightening with every pour of ghee-oblation, rather fulfilment of each need.</p>
<p class="comment">On conquering all the worlds Ravana assumed<em> indratva</em> 'Indra-hood.' So all the oblations in rituals shall belong to Ravana. Any
ritual other than this variety will be hindered or spoiled by this demon group. This is the real problem of all the celestials, as they are not
getting their due of oblations through Vedic-rituals. Ravana's throne, rather the seat of authority, itself is the Golden-Ritual-Altar of its kind,
and every praise, or extolment of Ravana is a hymn in his eulogy, and any offering made anywhere in his jurisdiction is an offering made into that
Ravana-Fire-Altar. That absolute power of Ravana is making him to glow to the bedazzlement of all the worlds. And how he got that Indrahood is said
next.</p>

<p class="comment">The disc of Vishnu here does not mean the <em>sudarshana cakra</em> of Vishnu. This is yet another missile which 
is one among many given to Rama by Vishvamitra. This <em>sudarshana cakra</em> is a &#39;thought of Vishnu to eliminate 
the vice...&#39; <em>sankalpa, </em>a conceptually symbolic missile in one of his hands. But in the core of its essence 
it is no disc with any sprockets and central thumb-hole etc.

She that demoness Shuurpanakha saw her brother who makes all beings to wail, an alarming one to all the worlds, an atrocious one and
highly formidable Ravana. [3-32-21b, 22a]</p>

<p class="comment">
Ravana is the nickname of Dashagriiva, or Dashakantha, or Dashaanana, or Dashakandhara. When Ravana 
tried to lift up Mt. Kailash with his twenty hands, on which Shiva, Parvati, Nandi, and a host of 
<em>pramatha 
gaNa</em>-s are there, Shiva pressed down the Mt. Kailash with his big toe. Then Ravana&#39;s twenty hands went 
under Mt. Kailash ehereby he started to yell in pain for a thousand years, terrifying all the worlds. Then, 
as advised by his ministers Ravana extols Shiva in a <em>stotram</em>, <em>danDakam</em> a rhythmical eulogy. That heavily 
worded eulogy is still available in the name of <em>raavaNa kR^ita daNDaka</em>. Then, Shiva releases Ravana&#39;s 
hands from under Mt. Kailash and blesses him to be renowned as &#39;Ravana&#39; then onward. This will be in 
the <em>uttara ramayaNa</em> seventh book. Thus, Ravana is the etymological derivation of the word from the root 
<em>ru</em> &#39;to make noise or weep...&#39;</p>
