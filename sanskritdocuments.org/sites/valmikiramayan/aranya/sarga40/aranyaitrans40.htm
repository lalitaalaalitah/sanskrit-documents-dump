<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest

<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 40<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana rebuts Maareecha for giving an unasked advice and details his plan to abduct Seetha. Ravana intimidates Maareecha that he
himself will kill Maareecha immediately if his orders are disobeyed, and Maareecha may perhaps have no opportunity to die at the hands of Rama.</p>

<p class="comment">A king cannot be addressed unless he asks. Then Maareecha, who is fully aware of
monarchical protocol, how he informed his analysis of Rama to Ravana, will be the question. Even if
a king is resolute in undertaking a mad act, he is to be cautioned. In some cases, a king is to be
held by hair and taught, as a teacher holds the taught by his tuft of hair to earbash. Likewise an
upright minister shall counsel the king properly, as Krishna advises Vidura in Maha Bharata at
Udyoga Parva 93:</p>

<p class="comment">The imperial protocol is an exaggerated affair, as known to everybody. Here Ravana is demanding one more aspect in demanding, 'the
words that do not go against the whims and fancies of the king.' And this is more than an autocrat's mentality. Dharmaakuutam says referring to
Kaamandaka, a scripture on political science: 'even if a king asks, one shall not 'readily' reply though every aspect of that question is known to
the replier, and the subject speaking in the audience of a king shall forget his own know-all-ness or his own entity in the knowledge of the subject
at issue. <em>vijaanan na api

<p class="comment">Ravana has already conquered Indra and the said gods are responsible for the routine administration of universe. Hence, he is
informing Maareecha about ordinary kings, presuming that Maareecha does not recognize the rectitude in dealing with ordinary kings, more so, with the
king of kings, namely Ravana himself, which he says in next verse. A king acquires these traits of the presiding deities of the compass, by virtue of
his kingship, and the sages said the very same to Rama when he entered Dandaka forest. <em>anena agni aadi dik
