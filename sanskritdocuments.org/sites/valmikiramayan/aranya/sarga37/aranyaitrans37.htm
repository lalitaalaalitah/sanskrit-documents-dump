<em>2. raajan</em> = oh, king; <em>priya vaadinaH puruSaa</em> = pleasantly, talking, people; <em>satatam sulabhaaH</em> =
always, easy - easy to get; <em>a priyasya</em> = of un, pleasant - judgementally; <em>pathyasya ca</em> = recuperative insipid diet-like
[suggestions,] also; <em>vaktaa</em> = who speaks them; or even; <em>shrotaa ca</em> = listener, also; <em>dur labhaH</em> = not, possible -
impossible to get.</p>
<p class="tat">
"It will always be easy to get people who talk pleasantly, oh, king, but it is impossible to get them who talk judgementally and give
suggestions that may be apparently insipid, but that are recuperative, more so, it is impossible to get listeners of such advises. [3-37-2]</p>
<p class="comment">There are many who render advises without weighing pros and cons, but just to
get along and please their master. There will be none to suggest expeditiously, though that
suggestion presently will be unpleasant and unsavoury like a recuperative insipid diet, but in
reality, it is result-oriented. Even if such an advisor suggests in earnest, he will have no
listener who listens earnestly and effectuates it. So, listen to my words that may now be
unsavoury, but will prove beneficial to you in long run, if you can foresee your future properly.
Dharmaakuutam says: <em>anena sva prayojana virodha sankayaa raaja buddhi anusaareNa vaktaaro 
mantriNaH sulabhaaH - kintu anartha paryavasaayino raajabuddhim tiraskritya shubhodarka vaktaaro 
mantriNo durlabhaa iti suucitam </em>- then the commentator goes on to quote vidura niiti from Maha Bharata, wherein it
is said: <em>yo hi dharma samaashritya hatvaa bhatruH priyaarthe | apriyaaNi aaha pathyaani tena 
raajaa sahaayavaan || sulabhaaH puruSaa raajan satatam priya vaadinaH | apriyasya ca pathyasya 
vaktaa shrotaa ca durlabhaH ||</em>&nbsp; The last two foots may be observed because they are similar to the above
verse of Ramayana, by such similarities some hold the opinion that Maha Bharata is an explanation
to Ramayana.</p>

fire, the luminosity of the fire also enhances immensely,&#39; and when the factor of resplendence is 
taken, it is not Rama&#39;s resplendence alone that is described, but Seetha&#39;s also. Again, it is not 
that some part of Rama&#39;s resplendence is taken out and put in Seetha. It is an indivisible radiance 
of that couple like that of Sun and his wife Prabha, as said earlier by Maareecha. Seetha is not 
directly said by her name but her father Janaka&#39;s name is brought in, because Janaka is both a <em>
raajarSi </em>and <em>brahmarSi </em>Kingly-saint and Brahman-sage, as well. And Janaka is capable 
of saying <em>idam brahmam idam kshaatram shaapat api sharaat api </em>&#39;here is Brahma-hood and here 
is Kshatriya-hood, either by malediction or by arrow, whichever meetly of you, you can confront me.&#39;

<em>shraddhayaa devo devatvam ashnute </em>and Seetha is the devotee of Rama and she became one with 
Rama. Thereby, there is twofold resplendence, namely, that of Rama and that of Seetha, so it is

of enmity with one's own people, too much belief in one's own womenfolk... are the four doors to death...' Hence, Maareecha is advising Ravana not to
embark on a wrong foot, and even if Seetha is forcibly abducted, she cannot be possessed because she surrounded by a firewall, namely the
