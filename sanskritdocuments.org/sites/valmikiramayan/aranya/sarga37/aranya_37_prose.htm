<p class="txt">
Maareecha advises Ravana to stay away from Rama with his own unpleasant experience with Rama&#39;s arrow 
when he was in Tataka forest, and portrays a gruesome picture of Rama to Ravana, asking him to not to 
meddle with Rama&#39;s affairs.</p>

<p class="verloc">
-----</p>

<p class="tat">
</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing that idea of the chief of demons Ravana in abducting Seetha, Maareecha, a well-informed one 
and an articulator spoke to the lord of demons in reply.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;It will always be easy to get people who talk pleasantly, oh, king, but it is impossible to get them 
who talk judgementally and give suggestions that may be apparently insipid, but that are recuperative, 
more so, it is impossible to get listeners of such advises.
</p>

<p class="comment">
There are many who render advises without weighing pros and cons, but just to
get along and please their master. There will be none to suggest expeditiously, though that
suggestion presently will be unpleasant and unsavoury like a recuperative insipid diet, but in
reality, it is result-oriented. Even if such an advisor suggests in earnest, he will have no
listener who listens earnestly and effectuates it. So, listen to my words that may now be
unsavoury, but will prove beneficial to you in long run, if you can foresee your future properly.
Dharmaakuutam says: <em>anena sva prayojana virodha sankayaa raaja buddhi anusaareNa vaktaaro 
mantriNaH sulabhaaH - kintu anartha paryavasaayino raajabuddhim tiraskritya shubhodarka vaktaaro 
mantriNo durlabhaa iti suucitam </em>- then the commentator goes on to quote vidura niiti from Maha Bharata, wherein it
is said: <em>yo hi dharma samaashritya hatvaa bhatruH priyaarthe | apriyaaNi aaha pathyaani tena 
raajaa sahaayavaan || sulabhaaH puruSaa raajan satatam priya vaadinaH | apriyasya ca pathyasya 
vaktaa shrotaa ca durlabhaH ||</em>&nbsp; The last two foots may be observed because they are similar to the above
verse of Ramayana, by such similarities some hold the opinion that Maha Bharata is an explanation
to Ramayana.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Definitely you do not apperceive Rama who is decidedly dynamic and exaltedly adept, for you are impetuous 
and desultory in dealing with your spies, but that Rama is identical to the thunderous Mahendra and 
tempestuous Varuna, the Rain-god.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, boy, will there be safety to all demons on earth? Or, that highly enraged Rama will render this 
world de-demonised!
</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;...but for you...&#39; &#39;Will you let the demons on earth live, or, would like to eradicate them through 
Rama, through your obsessions.&#39; The second thought has come true when Rama eliminated all demons.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Has this Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, taken birth to end your life, or what! And because of this 
Seetha will there be a great disaster, so to speak! Egocentric and rampant, such as you are, on acquiring 
you as her lord, will the City of Lanka be doomed along with her demons, and you put together, or what!
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Any king of your like who is with a self-will, ill-will, ensorcelled by evil, and malicious in intent, 
that king alone ruins his own city-state, his own people, even himself, as a matter of actual fact.
</p>

<p class="comment">
For this the commentator says: <em>anena dur mantritaH kaamavritto naya dveSii 
raajaa sakala mantri vargeNa aishvaryenA saha nashyati iti uktam - tathaa ca kaamandake - anaatmavaan naya 
dveSii vardhaya ari sampadaH | praapyaa api mahad aishvaryam saha tena vinashyati || </em> Dharmaakuutam being an encyclopedic commentary on
Ramayana quotes Kamandaka etc., in such matters of dharma. The availability of the books quoted by
the commentator of Dharmaakuutam in reprint is doubtful, where Dharmaakuutam itself is unavailable
in full, in these days.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Rama the enhancer of his mother Kausalya&#39;s happiness is completely forsaken by his father - no, he 
is not; there is unseemliness in him - no, not in the least; he is out of character - no; he is selfish 
- no; he is an ignoble Kshatriya - no, not at all; and he is neither a debased one insofar as the merits 
of righteousness are concerned, nor he is atrocious towards living beings, for he takes delight in the 
welfare of all beings. On seeing his father who is a proponent of truth, and whom Kaikeyi has outwitted, 
that virtue-souled Rama neatly decamped from Ayodhya saying that &#39;I will prove my father to be a real 
proponent of truth.&#39; Discarding the kingdom and even royal-comforts Rama entered Dandaka forest only 
to fulfil the cherish of Kaikeyi, viz., kingdom for her son Bharata, and even that of Dasharatha, viz., 
to remain loyal to his promise to Kaikeyi.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Rama is ruthless - no; an unscholarly one - no; unconquered are his senses - no; and oh, boy, it is 
unapt of you to speak of impalpable and unheard-of topics in this way. Rama is the embodiment of righteousness, 
he is an equable person with truthfulness as his valour, and as with Indra to all gods he is the king 
of entire world.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama&#39;s principles alone make him victorious, as he does not deviate from the path of righteousness. 
And by not deviating from the path of righteousness, he is truly valorous and the question of his defeat 
does not arise, because he will abide by his conscience.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Rama&#39;s proper resplendence is protecting Vaidehi. How then you really wish to forcibly rob her off 
from Rama, as though wishing to rob the Sun of his resplendence.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Incidentally, Prabha is the name of sun&#39;s brilliance and she is the wife of Sun, and if she is to be 
separated from sun, only an eternal gloom overcasts the world. Ravana has no doubt controlled natural 
forces like sun, moon, rivers etc., but not altogether eradicated or upturned their functions. Then, 
is it possible to Ravana and hosts of his demonic-adherents to thrive in an unnatural gloom? This is 
the doubt of Maareecha.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Arrows as it jets of fire, bow and sword as it firewood that fire called Rama will be blazing in war, 
and it will be inapt of you to enter into such an uninfringeable fire, recklessly.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;With the bow stretched to his ear becoming a gaping mouth spouting flames, arrows becoming tongues 
of fire spewed forth from that flaming mouth, he that Rama the reified Terminator will become fierce 
and insufferable when he wields bow and arrows, and oh, dear boy Ravana, it will be inapt of you to 
at once draw pretty nigh of such an annihilator of the armies of enemies, on discarding your kingdom, 
comforts and even the dear life of yours.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Which Rama&#39;s wife is Janaka&#39;s daughter that Rama is indeed with an inestimable
resplendence, and it will 
be incapable of you to steal Seetha while such a Rama&#39;s bow safeguards her in the forest, besides the 
firewall called his resplendence.
</p>

<p class="comment">
This can be said &#39;Rama&#39;s resplendence is inestimable and Seetha is his wife.&#39; But keeping the import 
of Seetha&#39;s words as at 3-9-15 &#39;if fuel is available in adjacency of burning fire, the luminosity of 
the fire also enhances immensely,&#39; and when the factor of resplendence is taken, it is not Rama&#39;s resplendence 
alone that is described, but Seetha&#39;s also. Again, it is not that some part of Rama&#39;s resplendence is 
taken out and put in Seetha. It is an indivisible radiance of that couple like that of Sun and his wife 
Prabha, as said earlier by Maareecha. Seetha is not directly said by her name but her father Janaka&#39;s 
name is brought in, because Janaka is both a <em>raajarSi</em> and <em>brahmarSi</em> Kingly-saint and 
Brahman-sage, as well. And Janaka is capable of saying <em>idam brahmam idam kshaatram shaapat api sharaat 
api</em> &#39;here is Brahma-hood and here is Kshatriya-hood, either by malediction or by arrow, whichever 
meetly of you, you can confront me.&#39; This apart, it is said that &#39;a pertinent devotion to a god makes 
the devotee like that god alone.&#39; <em>shraddhayaa devo devatvam ashnute</em> and Seetha is the devotee 
of Rama and she became one with Rama. Thereby, there is twofold resplendence, namely, that of Rama and 
that of Seetha, so it is inapt of you to make any useless effort when everything is firewalled.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;That lady Seetha is his wife, dearest than the lives of that lion-chested lion-man Rama, and in truth, 
she is avowed to follow him alone, in perpetuity. As the spire of blazing ritual fire cannot be abused, 
so also, she that curvaceous Maithili, the cherished wife of that dynamic Rama, is an impossibility 
for any abuse. Oh, king of demons, What is the result in making such a futile effort? If that Rama glances 
at you in a given war that alone ends your life.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The very start for any negative activity itself is self-ruinous to the starter.<em> anena sarva 
anarthaka kaaraNa bhuuto balavat virodho na kaarya iti suucitam - tathaa ca praaciinaaH - - anucita 
karma aarambhaH sva jana virodho baliiyasaa spardhaa | pramadaa jane vishvaaso mrityu dvaaraaNi 
catvaari || dk</em> &#39;undesirable activity, starting that activity, too much 
of enmity with one&#39;s own people, too much belief in one&#39;s own womenfolk... are the four doors to death...&#39; 
Hence, Maareecha is advising Ravana not to embark on a wrong foot, and even if Seetha is forcibly abducted, 
she cannot be possessed because she surrounded by a firewall, namely the resplendence of that couple.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;If you cherish to take pleasure for a long time in your life, in your comforts and also thus in your 
kingdom, which kingdom is highly impossible to achieve, do not do anything unpleasant to Rama.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Such as you are, you should firstly deliberate with all of your ministers that have a righteous bearing, 
duly keeping your brother Vibheeshana at the helm of affairs, and then you take a decision on your own 
considering rights and wrongs of the case, and bearing in mind about your own strengths and weakness, 
and even on making sure of Raghava&#39;s capability in its reality, and then it will be apt of you to take 
up befitting action that will be conducive to your interests.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, king of nightwalkers Ravana, I for myself deem that your confrontation with Rama, the prince of 
Kosala, in a war is improper, and a better, befitting, and a reasonable one is this advise of mine, 
to which you may listen further.
