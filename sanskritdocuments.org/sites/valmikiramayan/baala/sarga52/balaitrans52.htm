<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Vashishta offers hospitality to Vishvamitra and his armies. Even though the King 
Vishvamitra is disinclined to pressurise a hermit with such a burdensome affair 
of hospitality to hosts, Vashishta entreats the king to accept. Vishvamitra had 
to oblige the same. Vashishta summons his do-all Divine Sacred Cow, Shabala, also 
known as Kaamadhenu, requests her to generate heaps of tasteful foodstuffs for a 
royal banquet as well as for military rations.</p>

<p class="comment">
The reverential greeting <em>namaste</em> is from the root <em>nam</em> &#39;bend down 
a little...&#39; before upper echelons and the word <em>namas</em> is usually translated 
a &#39;salutation by bending a little...&#39; and <em>namas kaara</em> is the act of doing 
so. This word <em>namaH= na aham</em> is &#39;not me...&#39; <em>te astu</em> but &#39;you, 
it shall be...&#39; rather, &#39;I have lost my &#39;I-ness&#39; before you as I am humbling myself 
to your high knowledge or, high seat, or elder age...&#39; and let your &#39;your-ness&#39; 
prevail over me, for I am somewhat an inferior being before you...&#39; is the latent 
meaning.</p>

<p class="comment">
This is either vocalised or coupled with the gesture of adjoining palms, and that
<em>mudra</em> &#39;gesture...&#39; is called <em>an~jali</em> or as a Latinian friend of 
ours has provided its Latin counterpart as:</p>

<p class="comment">
The infinitive is <em>iungere manus ante pectus</em> &#39;to join hands in front of 
your chest...&#39; or merely <em>iungere manus</em> &#39;to join hands...&#39; We can say
<em>iungimus manus ante pectus</em> &#39;we join or fold our hands in front of us...&#39;
<em>iungo manus ante pectus</em> &#39;I fold my hands...&#39; <em>iungite manus ante pectus</em> 
&#39;fold your hands in front of you...&#39; This last sentence is the - you, plural - is 
in command form. Again, you may leave out <em>ante pectus</em> for succinctness.</p>

<p class="comment">
And if the word <em>iun</em> with a half &#39;n&#39; nasal is matched with Sanskrit <em>
a~n</em> in <em>an~jali</em> and the word <em>ngo</em> is matched with Sanskrit
<em>~nja</em> as the English &#39;g&#39; is most often used for Sanskrit &#39;ja&#39; by Max Muller 
et al., the two <em>an~jali</em> of Sanskrit and <em>iungo</em> Latin have same 
pronunciation and portent in prayer or traditional salutation.</p>
