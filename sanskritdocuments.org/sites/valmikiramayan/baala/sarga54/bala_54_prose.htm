<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties<br>&nbsp;Sarga 54 in Prose </h3>


			<p class="txt">
			The seizure of Kaamadhenu, the Sacred Cow, causes anxiety in her and 
			she urges Vashishta to counteract the atrocity of Vishvamitra. 
			Agreeing to her, the sage asks the Cow to create a force that can 
			subdue the forces of Vishvamitra. Accordingly, that Cow generates 
			newer forces and a war ensues.<br></p>

<p class="verloc">

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When Sage Vashishta did not yield Kaamadhenu, the milker of any desire, oh, 
Rama, then Vishvamitra started to seize it.&quot; Sage Shataananda continued the 
narration of the legend of Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;While the determined king Vishvamitra dragged her away from Vashishta, oh, 
Rama, Shabala is saddened and tearfully mulled over stung by the anguish of her 
secession from the sage. &#39;A pitiable and highly anguished one, such as I am. I 
am being dragged away by the servants of the king. Has this great souled Sage 
Vashishta abandoned me, or what? Or, did I do any misdeed towards that great 
sage of sacred soul whereby he is leaving me off. I have always been reverent 
and a cherished cow to that pietist and am I no errant.&#39; That cow eulogised in 
this manner.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On thinking thus and suspiring repeatedly, oh, enemy-subjugator, Rama, then she 
that Sacred Cow hastily rushed with the speed a gust and went to that highly 
energetic Vashishta on utterly shoving off hundreds of attendants of the king 
who are roping her, and then she straight went to the base of the feet of the 
great-souled Vashishta. She that moaning and groaning Shabala staying before the 
Sage Vashishta spoke this bellowing like a thunderous cloud.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, Son of Brahma, why I am discarded by you, whereby oh, god, the king&#39;s 
attendants are weaning me away from your proximity.&#39; So Shabala urged Vashishta. 
When he is spoken thus, then that Brahma-sage spoke this sentence to worrisome 
Shabala, whose heart is worrying with worry, as he would speak with his own 
sister in her worriment.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Neither I forswear you nor you fouled me, oh, Shabala, this king is forcibly 
weaning you away from me as he is beside himself with kingly arrogance. My 
ability is not balanceable with his, isn&#39;t it. Above all, on his part he is a 
king now, and a king will be mighty, he is the lord of the land and a Kshatriya, 
and thus we have to be subservient to a Kshatriya, isn&#39;t it. This <font color="#B3003A">
akshauhini
</font>unit of army is plethoric, overcrowded with elephants, horses, and 
chariots, and overspread with flags and elephants, thereby he is mightier than 
me.&#39; Thus Vashishta tried to pacify that Sacred-Cow.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;She who is spoken that way by Vashishta, that sententious Sacred Cow, Shabala, 
in her turn obediently spoke this sentence to that Brahma-sage of un-balanceable 
resplendence.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, Brahman, unstated is that the might of sovereignty as mightier than the 
might of sagacity. A sage is mightier than a sovereign. A sage&#39;s might is 
mightiest than the mightier sovereign, for a sage&#39;s might is angelic.&#39; So 
Shabala started talking to the sage.
</p>

<p class="comment">
This is the relevant stanza for the later time debates or essay competitions under 
the caption of &#39;pen vs. sword... which is mightier...&#39; Here, though Vishvamitra 
is well aware that a sage&#39;s possession cannot be usurped, he resorted to the same. 
The Sacred Cow is telling the above with intolerance towards Vishvamitra&#39;s violation 
of the norms. <em>saa api asahamaanaa kaama dohinii shaantyaa kShamayaa yuktam vashiShTam avocat 
-</em></p>

<p class="comment">
What a king has got to do with a sage&#39;s wealth? A sage acquires it with his ascesis 
and it is not another king&#39;s kingdom to conquer.
<em>
sarva dhamaj~nasyaa api vishvaamitrasya etaadR^ishii buddhiH abuut | yasmai devaa 
prayacchanti puruShaaya paraabhavam - bala avalepana vishvamitro vashiShTha vaakyam 
anaadR^itya brahmasva hareNa mahaa doSham jaanan api balaat eva shabalaam aacakarSha 
- dk</em> The scriptures, norms, ethics demand that a sagacious person 
shall not be robbed off his possession, which he acquires by his personal merit. 
But Vishvamitra&#39;s brain tilted this way because of his all-conquering avarice and 
he thought that this cow is also conquerable, and gods give such a mind only to 
see the greedy to fail and thus insulted of their might.</p>

<p class="comment">
<em>
na tu eva kadaacit svayam raajaa brahmaNasva adadiita - bodhaayana suutra - atha 
api udaaharanti - na viSham viSham iti aahuH brahmasvam viSham ucya te | brahmasvam

possession is not to be snatched away - <em>bodhaayana suutraa-s;</em> &#39;a poison 
if consumed kills one that consumes it... but the possession of a sagacious person, 
if tried for consumption, it consumes whole lot of the consumer&#39;s sons, grandsons 
and his clan itself, besides the consumer...for sage&#39;s possession in itself is a 
lethal poison...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Immutable is your power as you are mightier than great-mighty Vishvamitra and 
invincible is your dynamism. Ordain me, oh, highly resplendent sage, who am 
replete with the power of your sagacity, and I will disprove the vanity, valour, 
and venture of that injudicious king for this injudicious seizure.&#39; Thus Shabala 
implored the sage Vashishta.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, when spoken by her thus, that highly glorious Vashishta said to 
Shabala, the do-all cow, &#39;create a power that can overpower the power of 
opponent.&#39; Vashishta said so to Shabala. On hearing his sentence, oh, Rama, that 
Sacred Cow Shabala then created Pahlava kings, sprang forth from her mooing 
&#39;hums&#39;, and hundreds of them annihilated the army of Vishvamitra in its entirety 
just while Vishvamitra is witnessing it. King Vishvamitra was utterly infuriated 
and with wide-eyed anger he started to destroy those Pahlava-s with many a kind 
of his weaponry. On seeing the subdual of hundreds of Pahlava-s by Vishvamitra, 
then the Sacred Cow again generated deadly Shaka-s hobnobbed with Yavana-s 
through her mooing &#39;hums&#39;.
</p>

<p class="comment">
TThese Shaka-s and Yavana-s are the Shakas, or the Scythians, or the Indo-Scythians 
of Max Muller. Some discussion about this is included in the endnote of Kishkindha, 
Ch. 43. Dharmaakuutam says: <em>tadanu vashiShTha abhyanuj~naataa shabalaa nirmita pahlava aadi - nikR^iShTa jaati 
- niShuuditam svam balam vishvaamitra - iti - dk</em> These are viewed 
as deadly, lowly, ruffian class of warriors in Indian viewpoint and created out 
of thin air by this Sacred Cow.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then the earth was pervaded with the Shaka-s associated with Yavana-s, who have 
effectuation and bravery in overcoming their enemy forces, and who are golden in 
bodily colour similar to the golden pistils of flowers which complexion is 
outlandish. Yavana-s and Shaka-s, who are wielding bowie knives and broad lances 
and who are clad in golden coloured dresses, and who looked like glowing fires 
have completely burnt down entire force of Vishvamitra. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then that great-resplendent Vishvamitra indeed released his missiles, by which 
Yavana-s, Kaambhoja-s, and the Barbara-s, are rendered helter-skelter.&quot; Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The Barbara-s are said in this text whereas other mms contain it as &quot;Pahlava-s&#39;. 
Even on taking Barbara-s, they are an outlandish clan and the word &#39;Barbara&#39; 
might have been the ancestor word of the present day &#39;Barbarian.&#39;</p>
