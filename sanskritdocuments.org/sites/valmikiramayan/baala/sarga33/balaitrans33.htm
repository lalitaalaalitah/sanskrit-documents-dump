her son Brahmadatta, for the worthwhile deed done by him in removing the blemish 
caused by the Air-god to the girls, or in bringing those worthwhile girls as her 
daughter-in-laws. She is further gladdened while her feet are traditionally and 
repeatedly touched by a hundred daughter-in-laws in succession, coupled with her 
own raising of each of the daughter-in-law to embrace for a hundred times. Thus 
Somada has gone on caressing each of her hundred daughter-in-laws, and in doing 
so she is gladdened to do so over and over again, she is gladdened. She thus praised 
Kushanaabha for giving his gemlike daughters as her daughter-in-laws and blessed 
the daughter-in-laws. [1-33-26]</p>
