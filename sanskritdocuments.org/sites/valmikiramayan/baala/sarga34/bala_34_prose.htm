sarga 34 in prose</h3>
</center>

<p class="txt">Vishvamitra narrates about the birth of Gaadhi, his own father and the son of Kushanaabha. 
Incidentally he narrates about the emergence and prominence of River Kaushiki, who is Vishwamitra&#39;s 
elder sister turned out as a sacred River.<br></p>

<p class="verloc">.</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">When Brahmadatta has married and left, oh, Raghava, king Kushanaabha he embarked on Vedic-ritual 
called <font color=" #B3003A">putra kaameSTHi </font>in order to beget a son because is sonless. During 
the performance of the ritual, supremely generous Kusha, the brainchild of Brahma and the father of 
Kushanaabha, spoke to the king Kushanaabha. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;Oh, son, there will be a highly virtuous and selfsame son of yours, known as Gaadhi, 
and through him you also will get everlasting renown in the world.&#39; &quot; Thus Kusha said to Kushanaabha. 
Saying so, oh, Rama, Kushanaabha&#39;s father Kusa entered the sky and journeyed to the time-honoured abode 
of Brahma. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Then after some time that highly intellectual Kushanaabha begot a supremely righteous 
son known by the name Gaadhi. Oh, Rama of Kakutstha dynasty, that eminently righteous Gaadhi is my father, 
and since I am born in Kusha dynasty, oh, Raghu&#39;s legatee, I got the name Kaushika.&quot; Sage Vishvamitra 
thus narrating to Rama. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Even my elder sister who undertook benevolent vows and who is renowned by her name Satyavathi 
is there, oh, Raghava, and she is given in marriage to sage Ruchika. She journeyed to heaven with her 
body while she followed her departed husband and being a very generous lady she coursed as a great river 
renowned as River Kaushiki. </p>

<p class="comment">Now called Kos&#39;i (Cosy) corrupted from Kaus&#39;ikí, daughter of Kusha. &#39;This is one 
of those personifications of rivers so frequent in the Grecian mythology, but in the similar myths is 
seen the impress of the genius of each people, austere and profoundly religious in India, graceful and 
devoted to the worship of external beauty in Greece.&#39; Gorresio.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Desiring to yield benefit for the welfare of world, my sister has emerged with her divinely 
pious and delightful waters, taking recourse to Himalayan Mountains. </p>

<p class="comment">If the first compound is <em>lokasya hita kaama artham </em>then &#39;to accord both 
mortal and immortal happiness; <em>paara laukika, aihika saukhyam </em>. My sister&#39;s holy waves are 
hurled / To purify and glad the world. - Griffith.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Thereby, oh, Rama, I am delightfully and abidingly residing on the mountainsides of 
Himalayas, in adjacency of my sister Kausiki in all my affection for her. She that Satyavathi for her 
part is a pious one, steadfast in truthfulness and righteousness, a husband devout, and such a highly 
fortunate one has emerged as a best river among rivers, namely River Kaushiki. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Owing to my vow, oh, Rama, I left her for a while and came to the Accomplished Hermitage 
and owing to your magnificence I have become accomplished in that vow of mine. Oh, dextrous Rama, this 
is all about my dynasty, my province on which we are presently camping namely the riverbanks of Sona, 
and about my birth, and thus everything is narrated as you have asked me. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;By telling these legends it is past midnight, oh, Kakutstha, you get some sleep. Safe 
you be! Let no hindrance occur for us halfway on our pathway. Oh, Raghu&#39;s delight, trees are standstill... 
animals and birds have slouched... nightly sombre has pervaded all the confines. Eventide lapsed slowly 
and the vault of heaven filled with stars and starlets is splendorous as though orbs of heaven are overspread 
on its vault. Also, dissipating the darkness of the world with his brilliance, the moon with coolant 
moonbeams is rising up, gladdening the hearts of worldly beings. Now, the bands of yaksha-s, demons, 
even the ferocious ogres that feed on raw flesh, why them, all the beings that take pleasure in nights 
are astir, far and wide.&quot; So said Vishvamitra to Rama. </p>

<p class="tat">Saying so that greatly resplendent and eminent saint Vishvamitra paused, and then all 
the other sages have revered him saying, &quot;well-said, well-said. Sublime is this lineage of Kusha dynasty 
which always dedicated itself to righteousness, and the dynasts of Kusha are the best ones among mankind, 
and they symbolise with god Brahma himself, thus they are highly reverential.&quot; Thus the other sages 
have applauded Vishvamitra and his dynasty. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;You alone are exemplarily selfsame to Brahma, oh, Vishvamitra of great-renown, and among 
rivers that prominent River Kaushiki is your sister, thus she is glorifying your ancestry.&quot; Thus the 
sages lauded Vishvamitra. </p>

<p class="tat">Sage Vishvamitra is pleased when those tigerly sages have laude him, and then that magnificent 
sage Vishvamitra lapsed into the lap of sleep, as the sun lapses into lap of dusk for that day. </p>

<p class="tat">Even Rama with a little astonishment coming upon him, applauding that tigerly-sage, and 
glided into the lap of sleep along with Soumitri. </p>

<p class="verloc">&nbsp;</p>
