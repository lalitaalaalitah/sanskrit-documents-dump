<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties<br>Sarga 10 in Prose </h3>

   <p class="txt">Sumantra, the minister continues his narration to his king Dasharatha,
   about Rishyashringa's arrival at Anga kingdom of King Romapaada and his marriage with
   Princess Santha, the daughter of Romapada.<br></p>
<p class="verloc">----</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">Sumantra thus motivated by King Dasharatha, said these words to king
&quot;Oh! King, how and with which idea Sage Rishyasringa is brought by the ministers of
Romapada, all that will be spoken... that may please be listened from me along with
ministers... &quot;The ministers along with clergyman have spoken this way to King
Romapaada, ‘this is a non-harmful pan well thought over by us... Rishyasringa is a
forest-dweller absorbed in ascesis and self-study of Vedic scriptures, and he is not aware
of women, or of worldly-matters or of even worldly-pleasures...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;With much desired sense-pleasing objects that will be disquieting the
minds of men, we wish bring him to the city... Let it be decided quickly... Beautiful and
well decorated courtesans will go there to bring him hither by tempting with many a feint,
and let the courtesans be given ample gifts... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Hearing that the King replied the priest, &quot;Let it be so...&quot;
and then the priests and ministers have carried out the plan that way... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;On hearing that order of the king those best courtesans have entered
that great forest, and they camped not very far from that hermitage, making all the trials
for showing themselves off to a glance of that sage. </p>

<p class="comment">Any dictionary would give the meaning of courtesan as 'whore' or as
'court mistress'. But in Indian context, the courtesan is not to be taken in such a lowly
way as just a prostitute or a whore. They belong to a caste/class of artists. Juxtaposed
to the Four-Caste system there was a <em>deva dasi </em>Temple Dancers system, which is
the artist's class. On their receiving enough education and skills in the performing arts
and as per their capabilities, they will be nominated as Court Dancers or Temple Dancers
and the like. Ancients recognized sixty-four arts <em>chatuSaSTi kalaa </em>, which
include right from music, dance, and drama, sculpture, painting etc., up to the art of
thievery. Kings in their political or sovereign pursuits variedly used these Deva Daasis,
the courtesans.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Always satisfied is sage Rishyasringa to be in hermitage, thus he
never stirred out of that hermitage, and thus he has not seen any female, or a male, or
even any others objects of pleasure, either of city or of countryside from the time of
birth onwards... </p>

<p class="comment">Rishyasringa is thus not aware of gender differentiation or exposed to
any other object of pleasure, and thus his father conditioned him to achieve some supreme
ritual ideal.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Then at one time Rishyasringa casually arrived at that place, and
hasseen those comely females. They the lustful women are amazingly attired and singing
melodious tunes, all of them neared the sage's son and spoke these words...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Who you are? Why you move lonely in these deep and desolate forests,
why you conduct yourself like this? Oh! Brahman, we are interested to know... please tell
us...&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Those women are in most desirable form and hitherto he has not seen
such forms in that forest, hence a kind of friendship spouted, with which he is inclined
to detail about his father... My father is Sage Vibhandaka and I am his true descent son.
I am known as Rishyasringa, by my name and by an event on my birth, and thus renowned on
earth...&quot;</p>

<p class="comment">The birth-event associated with his name is that he is born with a horn
on the crown of his head. Thus he is named as Rishyasringa, i.e., <em>R^iSi</em>= the Sage;
<em>sR^i~Nga</em>= horn; a Sage with a horn, and this here he recalls his birth time event.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Our hermitage is here only, oh, august ones, I wish to perform
scripturally worship to you all verily there...” thus said the sage to the courtesans.
On hearing the words of sage's son, all those courtesans are verily inclined to see the
threshold of that hermitage, then all the women went to hermitage. On going there, then
the Sage's son performed worship saying &quot;Here is our hand-wash, here is our
feet-wash, here are our tuber fruits, here are the juicy fruits of ours... &quot; </p>

<p class="comment">This portrays the exclusion of the sage's son from the rest of the
world by his father. He worshipped the courtesans, as he would worship some super-natural
deities by saying the above words, which will usually be used in ritual worship of Hindu
deities. He being a fruitarian has offered the courtesans the tuber fruits like sweet
potatoes etc., which are ridiculous to urbanites, that too to the pleasure-taking
courtesans.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;All of them have received that kind of worship much enthusiastically,
but dread at the arrival of the sage Vibhandaka, they quickly made-up their mind to make
away from there.&nbsp; 'Take these important fruits of ours, oh, Brahman, you be safe, oh,
holy one... eat them before long....' Said courtesans to Rishyasringa. Then all of the
courtesans have embraced him and all of them with a kind of mirthfulness in the offing,
presented sweet-balls and other varieties of best sweetmeats to him. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Having relished the sweets, that resplendent sage supposed them to be
fruits only, for he did not taste sweets earlier, as he is always forest-bound. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Taking leave of the Sage Rishyasringa on pretence that they also have
to perform devotional duties, they the courtesans departed from there on the pretext of
their daily worship, while they actually feared for the arrival of Rishyasringa's father
who may hurl curses on his arrival... After the departure of all them the courtesans, that
Brahman Rishyasringa, the grandson of Sage Kaashyapa, is disturbed at heart and even
behaved sadly... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Then on the next day Rishyasringa, son of Vibhandaka and the
prosperous sage with ascetic power has arrived at that place where he saw well-decorated
and delightful courtesans recollecting in mind repetitively about them alone.&nbsp; Then
on seeing the arrival of that Brahman, the courtesans felt happy at heart, and all of
those courtesans on surrounding him said, &quot;oh, gentle one, welcome to the threshold
of our hermitage... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;There are excellent tuber fruits and fruits and there will be a very
distinctive hospitality... definitely indeed...” So said the courtesans. On hearing the
heart-pleasing words of all those courtesans, Rishyasringa made up his mind to go over
there, and then those women took him away to their place in Anga Kingdom.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;While that great soul ad Brahman Rishyasringa while being brought
into Anga Kingdom, then the Rain-god quickly showered rain in Anga kingdom to the delight
of the world. Towards that Brahman Rishyasring who is coming along with rains into his own
kingdom Anga Kingdom, the king Romapada has gone towards that sage and bowed his head
down, and paid respects touching the ground, and offered water customarily with dedication
and the king besought beneficence of the best one, Rishyasringa to save from the fury of
his father Sage Vibhandaka, even after knowing the king's pursuit in bringing Rishyasringa
to this country... </p>

<p class="comment">The salutation in prostration on the ground is usually performed before
Gods or Deities, in reverence. It is called <em>saaSTaanga praNaamam = sa aSTa anga
praNaamam</em> , i.e., saluting with eight body parts touching the ground, indicating his
absolute surrender to the worshipped.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;On entering the palace princess Shanta is given to Rishyasringa in
customary marriage, and then that King Romapada obtained rejoice with a peaceful mind. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot; Thus that great fulgent Rishyasringa lived in Anga kingdom along
with his wife Shanta, and with all his desires fulfilled and also well worshipped&quot;
Thus Sumantra said the legend of Rishyasringa to King Dasharatha.</p>
