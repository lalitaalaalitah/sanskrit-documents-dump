			<p class="txt">
			Trishanku seeks shelter of Vishvamitra when the sons of Vashishta rebuffed 
			him, and even cursed him to become a profaner. Narrating his sad tale 
			and his idealistic idea of going to heaven with mortal body, Trishanku 
			earnestly appeals to Vishvamitra.</p>

curse issued by the sons of Vashishta to Trishanku. [1-58-8b, 9a]</p>

<p class="comment">
This expression <em>caNDaal</em> has its own impact. The nomenclature of <em>caNDaal</em> 
is not the present day &#39;untouchable&#39; &#39;outcaste&#39; or a &#39;pariah&#39; etc., because he is 
also a member and an important functionary in Hindu system of castes. In Aranya 
Kanda Seetha admonishes Ravana with the same wording at 3-56-18. The analogy she 
uses there is to differentiate between functionaries like the Vedic-scholar and 
the caste-bound Profaner [meaning: one who is not initiated into religious rites 
or any esoteric knowledge... but socially designated as a Cremator] and between 
the Altar of Fire and Fire of Pyre, and between the Vedic Ritual and Funeral Rites, 
both involving Vedic-hymns. A Vedic scholar, or a true Brahmin may perhaps conduct 
a <em>yaj~na</em> but he is no authority to conduct <em>antya kriya</em> &#39;funerals&#39; 
till its end. At best, a priest&#39;s function is until the lighting of the pyre, and 
even perhaps until <em>kapaala moksha</em> &#39;breakage of cranium...&#39; and from then 
on it is the function of this <em>caNDaal</em> to take care of the corpse consigned 
to fire and for its complete cremation, since leaving half burnt corpse to vultures 
and wolves is sinning as well as for unsanitary situations. Thus, if a Vedic scholar 
conducts <em>jaata aadi kriyaaH</em> &#39;rites from birth onwards...&#39; as an initiator, 
then a <em>caNDaal</em> conducts <em>antya, uttara kriyaaH</em> &#39;rites of death 
afterwards...&#39; as a terminator. This verbiage is to demark the relative values of 
functionaries, according to the maxim &#39;a donkey is to bear and a dog is to bark...&#39; 
and if their functions are reversed, reversed are our results.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;While I am a pursuant in probity I expect to avail myself of the fruition of 
this kind of Vedic-ritual. Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, but my mentors are not 
deriving complete contentment by my pursuit. Hence, they shove me off. [1-58-21b, 
22a]</p>

&quot; &#39;I deem destiny is the only ultimate, and manly efforts are meaningless, for destiny
