<p class="comment">
The three-way coursing of the river is firstly as Ganga in the lap of Himalayas. 
Then when she cruised heavenward with divinities as Deva Ganga, or Mandaakini or 
Sudiirghika, it is second. Later, when she came to earth from heaven and gone into 
ocean and even to netherworlds as Jahnavi, it is the third. There are variations 
for this. Some say that the river&#39;s entry into sky is the first, by taking words
<em>gati mataam vara, gati</em> and deriving meaning as - which sky grants a path 
for all moving things etc., and the next is her entry to heaven, and nextly her 
coming to earth. And some say that gods have not left her in middle of the sky to 
come to heaven at a later time, and hence her three courses are as Ganga, Mandaakini, 
and Jahnavi.</p>
