<p class="txt">The ritual horse released by Sagara, the Emperor, is snatched away by Indra in order 
to cause hindrance to the ritual. The ritual cannot proceed to culmination without the horse. Then Sagara 
orders his sixty thousand sons to search for it. If it is no found on the surface of earth, he asks 
them to dig over the earth. And the princes do accordingly, to the grief of beings living in netherworlds. 
Then all pray for the mercy of Brahma to alleviate this dangerous situation.<br></p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">On listening to the words of Vishvamitra highly rejoiced is Rama, of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, 
at the end of the episode, spoke to sage, who is fire-like in his glow. &quot;I am interested to listen this 
episode exhaustively, oh, Brahman, as to how my ancestor Sagara conducted the Vedic-ritual...&quot; Said 
Rama to the Sage.</p>

<p class="tat">On listening the words of Rama, which are inclusive of his enthusiasm, Sage Vishvamitra 
spoke to that descendent of Kakutstha, as if smilingly... &quot;Let this be listened vividly, oh, Rama, about 
the great-souled Sagara&#39;s Vedic-ritual... the father-in-law of Lord Sankara is well-known by the name 
of Himavan... And Himavan setting eyes on Mt. Vindhya stands loftily and they stare at each other... 
in between those two, namely Himalayas and Vindhya ranges, oh, Rama, the best of men, that Vedic-ritual 
came to pass...</p>

<p class="tat">That very area, oh, Rama, the Tigerly-man, is much renowned for the performances of Vedic- 
rituals... and in the course of the performance, oh, descendant of Kakutstha, of that Sagara&#39;s horse-ritual, 
Amshuman, Sagara&#39;s grandson, and the son of exiled Asamanja who is a great chariot-rider with an unfaltering 
bow...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Amshuman managed abiding by his grandfather Sagara&#39;s convictions followed the course 
of the ritual-horse... and at an auspicious time, on the day of <em>ukthyam, </em>the day for a sacred 
function, Indra stole the ritual horse of that ritual&#39;s chief, namely Sagara... On assuming a demonic 
form Indra snatched away that ritual-horse, and oh, Rama, when that ritual-horse of that great-souled 
Sagara being stolen thus...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;All the congregations of the Ritviks, the religious-teachers, then spoke to the chief 
propitiator, Sagara, &#39;at this auspicious time the ritual horse is eagerly taken away...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;Kill him who stolen the horse, oh, Sagara, the descendent of Kakutstha, and that horse 
shall also be fetched, lest all this Vedic-ritual becomes hindered and for all of us it is unpropitious...&nbsp; 
Oh, king, that shall be done thus and let the Vedic-ritual be completed unobstructedly...&#39; Thus, the 
Ritviks spoke to the king and he that king Sagara, on hearing the words of religious-teachers, in that 
religious-council, that king Sagara, to his sixty thousand sons spoke this much,</p>

<p class="tat">&#39;oh, best ones among men, for me it is unbelievable that demons can approach this ritual 
place... &#39;For this very glorious Vedic-ritual is being performed duly sanctified by the Vedic-hymns 
by the holy-sanctifiers... therefore, be gone, my sons, to quest after the path of horse-thief, be safe, 
you all...</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;&#39;Oh, sons, let all of the earth encompassed by the oceans be followed up, for vast 
is the earth&#39;s surface you allocate among yourselves the searching area, each to each square yojana 
area and advance...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;Until the appearance of the horse you search on the surface, and if it is not found 
on the plane of earth... from then on you dig over the earth and search the subterranean planes even... 
search him out, that horse-stealer... &#39;For I am under vow of ritual, I along with my grandson, namely 
Amsuman, and with my religious-teachers, I stay here only... till the horse appears... safe be to you 
all... proceed for searching...&#39; Thus Sagara instructed to his sixty-thousand sons and stayed back at 
the ritual place.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;They, oh, Rama, those great-mighty princes are all gladdened at heart, and proceeded 
onto earth&#39;s surface, animated by their father&#39;s words, in their preliminary round of their search.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;On proceeding thus on earth in its entirety those great-mighty ones did not find that 
horse, then as said by their father, they mapped the earth as one square yojana area for each of them, 
and each and every area on the surface of earth is hollowed out by those tigerly-men, who have diamond-similar 
touch for their arms [or, nails.]</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;With spears that are thunderbolt-similar and even with ploughs that are very gruelling, 
when the earth is being dug, Mother Earth bewailed, oh, Rama, of Raghu&#39;s dynasty... Then on being killed, 
the serpents, asura-s, demons, and other beings living underneath the earth&#39;s surface, suffering the 
hollowing, and from them, oh, Rama, emerged is an unbearable rumpus&nbsp; that is unstoppable...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh, Rama of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, thus sixty thousand square yojana-s of the earth is dug 
over, as though to make the earth&#39;s outermost plane as the unsurpassed <em>rasaa tala, </em>the sixth 
subterranean, nethermost plane... Oh, Rama, the kingly tiger, the sons of Sagara, thus digging over 
the Jambu Island, which is verily congested with mountains, and thus they essayed in all places...</p>

<p class="comment">The <em>jambu dwiipa</em> is a continent according to Hindu mythology where the total 
continents listed are seven. <em>jambuu plakShaahya dviipau shaalmaliH ca aparo dvija | kushaH krauncaH 
tathaa shakaH puShkaraH ca eva ca saptamaH</em> the seven continents are <em>jambu- plaksha - shaalmali- 
kusha - kraunca - shaaka - puSkara</em>, and <em>jambu dwiipa</em> is one among them.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Then all the gods, with gandharva-s, asura-s, and reptiles who are distraught at heart 
about their extinction due to the nethermost digging of the earth, neared the Forefather, Brahma... 
They, on seeking the grace of Brahma, the great-soul, then with their distressed faces spoke this sentence 
with great fear to Brahma...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh, God Brahma, the sons of Sagara are digging over all the earth, thus, many a great-soul 
that move in waters and those that live in netherworlds, are being killed...&nbsp; &#39;This one is the 
destroyer of our ritual... by him alone our ritual-horse is carried off...&#39; thinking thus and suspecting 
everyone, they, the sons of Sagara are torturing all living beings...&#39; Thus all the gods appealed to 
Brahma...&quot; So said Sage Vishvamitra to Rama and others.</p>
