<p class="comment">
Here the word used by Sumantra is <em>tava putra aagamam</em> , it renders as &#39;the arrival 
of your sons&#39;, meaning that sons of King Dasharatha arrive from Heavens, but not through an 
ordinary parturition. Even earlier in time to that of Dasharatha, Sage Sanatkumara predicted 
the &#39;arrival&#39; of Vishnu as Rama. The birth-event associated with Rishyasringa&#39;s name is that 
he is born with a horn on the crown of his head. Thus he is named as Rishyasringa, i.e., em&gt; 
R^iSi the Sage; <em>shR^i~Nga</em> horn; a Sage with a horn on his forehead at his birth time. 
This being the mythological import, he is an acme among sages, as <em>shR^i~Nga</em> also 
means a peak.</p>

Not knowing others that Brahman the best, will always be abiding his father, lest his renowned

<p class="comment">
The word <em>dvaividhyam</em> also means two kinds of celibacy, <em>vratitva</em> and <em>
prajaapatyam</em>. One, as a bachelor and the other after marriage, voluntarily distancing 
away from his wife on certain forbidden days like full moon and new moon days, during daytime, 
eclipses, and other astronomical occurrences and some more. This kind of self-imposed celibacy 
is one way of observing sustained family planning methods, instead of resorting to medicaments. 
Here, this word is more nearer to mean &#39;hindrance&#39;, than to mean the &#39;two way celibacy&#39; as 
deciphered by some commentators.</p>
