<p class="tat">Sumantra, the charioteer and one of the misters of King 
Dasharatha, having heard all about the king&#39;s desire to perform a Vedic ritual, 
said this in confidence to king, &quot;Oh, king, I will tell an early legend, an 
early legendary narration that I listened... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh, king, I have earlier heard of this present advice given to 
you by Vedic scholars, as godly Sage Sanatkumara has once narrated an account 
about the arrival of your sons in the presence of other sages, and sage Sanat 
Kumara said... He said that &quot;Sage Kashyapa has a son known as Vibhaandaka, and 
his son will be the renowned Sage Rishyasringa, and that Sage Rishyasringa will 
grow up in forests, and will always be dwelling in forest... </p>

<p class="comment">Here the word used by Sumantra is <em>tava putra aagamam </em>
, it renders as &#39;the arrival of your sons&#39;, meaning that sons of King Dasharatha arrive from 
Heavens, but not through an ordinary parturition. Even earlier in time to that of Dasharatha, Sage 
Sanatkumara predicted the &#39;arrival&#39; of Vishnu as Rama. The birth-event associated with 
Rishyasringa’s name is that he is born with a horn on the crown of his head. Thus he is named as 
Rishyasringa, i.e., <em>R^iSi</em> the Sage; <em>shR^i~Nga </em>horn; a Sage with a horn on his forehead 
at his birth time. This being the mythological import, he is an acme among 
sages, as <em>shR^i~Nga </em>also means a peak.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Not knowing others, that Brahman the best, namely Rishyasringa, 
will always be abiding his father and he will follow celibacy of two kinds 
Brahmanical vows namely <font color="#B3003A">vratitva </font>, <font color="#B3003A">
praajaapatya </font>...</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">Or</p>

<p class="tat">Not knowing others that Brahman the best, will always be abiding 
his father, lest his renowned celibacy always praised by the Brahmans, will be 
hindered. </p>

<p class="comment">The word <em>dvaividhyam </em>also means two kinds of 
celibacy,<em>
vratitva </em>and <em>prajaapatyam</em>. One, as a bachelor and the other after 
marriage, voluntarily distancing away from his wife on certain forbidden days 
like full moon and new moon days, during daytime, eclipses, and other 
astronomical occurrences and some more. This kind of self-imposed celibacy is 
one way of observing sustained family planning methods, instead of resorting to 
medicaments. Here, this word is more nearer to mean &#39;hindrance&#39;, than to mean 
the &#39;two way celibacy&#39; as deciphered by some commentators.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;In the world he becomes famous for his celibacy, oh king, and he 
will always be praised by Brahmans, and thus time will pass on with that kind of 
his conduct...
</p>

<p class="tat">Sage Rishyasringa looses no time with his servitor-ship to the 
Sacrificial Fire and also to his celebrated father, and during this period alone 
there will be a famed and very strong kingRomapaada, a valiant in Anga 
country... But by a violation of righteousness of that king there will be a 
shocking and devastating famine in that country... While the famine is besetting 
that king Roamapada will be afflicted with grim, and on summoning Brahmans and 
learned scholars he will address them... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot; ‘All of you are well versed in rituals and knowers of the world 
history... order me how to how the purification from sin will be... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot; ‘Thus said by king those scholarly Brahmans and Vedic scholars 
will say to the king, &#39;oh, king, son of Sage Vibhaandaka, namely Rishyasringa, 
is to be fetched by all methods... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh! King, having brought Sage Rishyasringa and honouring him 
well with good care, procedurally give him your daughter Shanta in marriage to 
that Vedic Brahman and the son of Sage Vibhaandaka... On listening them the king 
becomes thoughtful about the idea by which it is possible to bring that 
self-controlled sage to his place...Then that intellectual king decides along 
with ministers, to dispatch clergymen and ministers, honouring them well, and 
then sends them... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;They on hearing king&#39;s words are awestruck and lowering their 
faces they will say, &#39;we can not go there as we are afraid of sage Vibhandaka, 
father of Rishyasringa...&#39; After thinking over they will say as a second 
thought, and having found a solution with a plan to bring that sage, &#39;we will 
fetch that Brahman and also by that no stigma will occur...&#39; </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Thus by the king of Anga kingdom and by his courtesans the son 
of sage Rishyasringa will be brought and the presiding deity for rains will 
showers rains, and Shanta will also be given in marriage to that sage...’ </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Sage Rishyasringa, son-in-law of Romapaada, King of Anga ad as 
well as to you, if invited to our kingdom he will bless you to beget sons, oh! 
King... so said Sage Sanatkumaara to other sages and all this is retold by me.&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">Thus the charioteer and the Minister Sumantra completed his 
narration in confidence to King Dasharatha.</p>

<p class="comment">Comment: Sage Rishyasringa is also a son-in-law to King 
Dasharatha. Princess Shanta, in a distant relationship is a daughter to King 
Dasharatha in relation and the adopted daughter of Romapaada, the King of Anga. 
Thus Sumantra&#39;s saying son-in-law also means Dasharatha&#39;s son-in-law, besides 
Romapada’s.</p>

<p class="tat">Then King Dasharatha is delighted and in turn spoke to Sumantra 
&quot;By what idea Rishyasringa is brought to Anga kingdom, that shall be said...&quot; </p>
