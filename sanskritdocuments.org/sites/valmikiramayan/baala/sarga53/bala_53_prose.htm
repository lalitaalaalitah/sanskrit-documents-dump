<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties
<br>Sarga 53 in Prose </h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Vishvamitra tries to gain Kaamadhenu, but Sage Vashishta persistently 
			refuses Vishvamitra&#39;s bargains and barters. &#39;When an ordinary cow alone 
			is held sacred and it is an un-marketable commodity, how then can Shabala, 
			a milker of any wish, be given away or bartered for other riches...&#39; 
			is the argument of Vashishta. Yet, Vishvamitra goes on his bidding, 
			but in vain.<br><br>
</p>


<p class="verloc">

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, enemy-chastener Rama, when the Divine Cow Shabala is spoken in this way by 
Sage Vashishta, then that milker bestowed each and every fancy, fancied by each 
and every fancier, according to one&#39;s own fancy.&quot; Thus Sage Shataananda continued 
the legend of Shabala or Kaamadhenu, as a part of the legend of Vishvamitra to Rama 
and others.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Shabala bestowed dishes of sugar cane and honey, and flakes of all sorts, like cornflakes, 
rice-flakes, also best arracks and liquors in best wineglasses, further, the drinks 
and foodstuffs that are very diverse and verily apposite to royalties and army-men. 
There emerged mountainous stacks of steamy foodstuffs, palatable side-dishes and 
desserts of rice etc., also the dumplings of cooked pulses, like that the cascades 
of curds and the other milk products likes butter, ghee, cheese etc. Thousands of 
silver dishes and hollowware fully replete with daintily soft drinks, like that 
full with sugar-candy preparations, and with preparations that comprise all the 
six tastes have come up together with delectable foodstuffs made out of treacly 
dumplings of cane sugar.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, all of the men in the forces of Vishvamitra, who are already rejoiced 
and regaled by the regular feasts accorded by their king Vishvamitra, are now comparatively 
well gladdened when feasted by Sage Vashishta, in which they rejoiced and regaled, 
for a good measure. Partaking that feast together with the best royal ladies of 
palace chambers, and with the court-scholars and the court-priests even the king 
Vishvamitra, who by his nature is a kingly sage, became exultant and energetic. 
When honoured along with his advisers, ministers and attendants by way of receiving 
a royal banquet, king Vishvamitra then in high admiration spoke this to Vashishta.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;You showed me a generous hospitality whereby I am esteemed by an estimable sage 
like you, oh, expert in sententiousness, now I wish to say for myself to which you 
may please listen. Oh, godly sage, this Shabala may be given to me for a barter 
of a lakh, a hundred thousand, cows. Indeed this do-all cow is a treasure, and the 
kings are the gatherers of treasures. Therefore bestow this cow to me. As rule this 
cow also belongs to me.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra said to Vashishta.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When Vishvamitra addressed him in that way, the reverential sage Vashishta, who 
is a virtue-souled eminent saint, on his part replied the king in this way.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;I cannot afford Shabala, neither by the barter of a hundred thousand cows, nor 
by hundreds of millions of cows, nor by lots and lots of silver, either. Abandoning 
her from my proximity is unmeet for her, oh, enemy-subjugator, you cannot even subjugate 
me terroristically and try to wean this cow away from me, as Shabala is everlastingly 
and inseparably mine, as with the everlasting and inseparable respectability of 
a self-respectful person. This cow makes the journey of my life possible. Oblations 
to gods or manes, enkindling of Ritual-fire, religious sacrifices,
<font color="#B3003A">homa</font>-s, the sacred rituals conducted as
<font color="#B3003A">darsha, paurNa maasi</font>, all are dependent on her.
</p>

<p class="tat">
This cow is the bedrock for everything in its entirety, and regarding diverse and 
numerous indoctrinations, and even for add-on syllabics like
<font color="#B3003A">svaaha, vaSaT</font>, they are all dependent on this cow, 
there is no doubt about it.
</p>

<p class="comment">
When the Fire-Ritual, or <em>homa </em>is conducted each pouring of fluid oblation 
or each dropping of solid oblation into Fire-Altar is associated with Vedic-hymns 
addressing the particular receiver-deity, annexed with syllabics like:<em> svaahaa, 
svaahaa kaaraaH </em>at the end of each chant like <em>indraaya svaahaa, indraaya 
idam na mama... varuNaaya svaahaa, varuNaaya idam na mama... </em>&#39;to Indra this 
is scarified, this is for Indra, not mine... to Rain-god this is sacrificed, this 
is for Rain-god, not mine...&#39; So also the <em>vaSaT </em>is annexed to the hymns 
addressed to manes. To learn Veda-s one shall be eligible to perform a Fire-ritual, 
and if Fire-ritual is performed, some basic Vedic hymns are to be learnt, and all 
this is a cyclic affair, requiring much paraphernalia. This cow supplies everything 
at wish, without a hassle, either to the teacher or to the taught.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &quot;In truth, this cow is everything to me and ever-gratifier, that way by so many 
reasons, oh, king, I cannot afford Shabala to you or to anyone.&quot; So said Vashishta 
to Vishvamitra. Though Vashishta spoke thus Vishvamitra being an expert in sententiousness 
then spoke this sentence compellingly and argumentatively.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;I bestow upon you fourteen thousand elephants adorned with golden girdles, golden 
necklets and golden goads. I will grant you eight hundred golden chariots whichever 
can be yoked on with four whitely-white horses trimmed up with the sets of tintinnabulating 
bells. I grant you, oh, superbly vowed sage, eleven thousand fleetly galloping horses 
of high pedigree born in best countries of best horse breeding. I award ten million 
diversely coloured and differently divisionalized cows, whichever of them will be 
came of age as milker, thereby, let this do-all cow Shabala be given to me. Or, 
oh, eminent Brahman, if you yearn either for gems or gold, I gift that much of everything 
as much as you can yearn, let Shabala be given to me.&quot; Thus Vishvamitra entreated 
again.
</p>

<p class="tat">
When the shrewd king Vishvamitra spoke to the reverential sage Vashishta, that sage 
has clearly said, &#39;whatever it is oh, king, I do not surrender Shabala, the cow. 
Really this alone is my gemmy cow, thus I do not require your jewels or gems... 
truly, this alone is my treasure, thus I do not require your gilded chariots, horses 
or elephants... really, this alone is my everything, thus I need nothing from you... 
and actually, this alone is my alter-ego, thus you cannot separate me from myself. 
This alone is my <font color="#B3003A">darsha, puurNa maasa </font>rituals, and 
like that this alone is all my Vedic-rituals with worthwhile donations and oh, king, 
this essentially is of service in diverse activities of mine.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, king, all of my activities are instated in this cow, then wherefore a lot 
of palavering a bargain or barter? I do not give away this milker any wish.&quot; So 
said VashishtaT to Vishvamitra, and thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration 
of the legend of Sacred Cow.&nbsp;

Sacredness of the Cow
</p>


<p class="comment">
If cow is held sacred in India it is held precious all over the world. Whatever is given by a cow, from 
its milk to cow-dung, it is put to use, even for medicinal purposes, which is evident from insulin and 
smallpox vaccines. Regarding <em>go mahaatmyam</em> &#39;sacredness of cow&#39; Bheeshma speaks at length about 
the sacredness of cow to Yudhishtar, in Anushaashanika Parva of Maha Bharata.</p>

<p class="comment">
Here, on hinting in an indirect way about <em>go mahaatmyam</em> &#39;the sacredness of the cow...&#39; and 
its un-marketability, Sage Vashishta paused his negation, hoping that Vishvamitra will realise, as he 
is also well-versed in scriptures.</p>
