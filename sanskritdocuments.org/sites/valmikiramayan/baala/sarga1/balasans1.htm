<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - Book Of Youthful Majesties<br>Chapter [Sarga] 1<br>Verses converted to UTF-8: Sept 09<br>
Introduction</h3>

<p class="tat">
Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed 
of his duty to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits 
from Narada about most virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing 
Rama Narada gives an outline of Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in 
this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality, chastity and the like.</p>

<p class="tat">
Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of Gayatri 
Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that 
classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses 
identified with the 24 letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given 
in the endnote of this page. In tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with 
letter <em>ta</em> an auspicious letter.</p>

<h3>An Appeal to Readers</h3>

<p class="tat">
We have taken every care to present this translation truthfully, but when working with machines, they 
start to exhibit their talents on the very first key-stroke, like &#39;Auto Correct, Auto Complete, Auto 
Insert etc.,&#39; and thus start correcting words like &#39;high souled one&#39; to &#39;high-soled one...&#39; and the 
like. So taking the maxim <em>pramaado api dhiimataam</em> &#39;even the diligent may make mistakes...&#39; 
we appeal to the readers to kindly inform us if anything has gone wrong any where, typos, and &#39;is&#39; becoming 
&#39;was&#39;, &#39;are&#39; becoming &#39;were&#39; and the like, so that they will be corrected, true to the text and spirit 
of Ramayana.</p>

तपः स्वाध्याय निरताम् तपस्वी वाग्विदाम् वरम् |<br>नारदम् परिपप्रच्छ वाल्मीकिः मुनि पुंगवम् || १-१-१</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. anvaya / parsing: tapasvii vaalmiikiH tapaH svaadhyaaya niratam vaagvidaam varam muni pumgavam 
naaradam pari papracCha</em></p>

<p class="pratipada">
1. <em>tapasvii</em> = sagacious thinker; <em>vaalmikiH</em> = Sage [Poet] Valmiki; <em>tapaH</em> = 
in thoughtful-meditation; and; <em>sva adhyaaya</em> = in self, study [of scriptures]; <em>niratam</em> 
= always - who is eternally studious in scriptures; and; <em>vaak</em>= in speaking [in enunciation];
<em>vidaam</em> = among expert enunciators; <em>varam</em> = sublime one - with Narada; <em>muni pungavam</em> 
= with sage, paragon, with such a paragon sage Naarada; <em>naaradam</em> = with [such a sage] Naarada;
<em>pari papracCha</em> = verily [inquisitively,] inquired about; [ellipt. <em>sarva guNa samiSTi ruupam 
puruSam</em> = all, merited endowments, composite, in form - about such a man.]</p>

<p class="tat">
A thoughtful-meditator, an eternally studious sage in scriptures about the Truth and Untruth, a sagacious 
thinker, and a sublime enunciator among all expert enunciators is Narada, and with such a Divine Sage 
Narada, the Sage-Poet Valmiki is inquisitively enquiring about a man who is a composite for all merited 
endowments in his form and calibre. [1-1-1]</p>

<h3>The efficacy of Opening Verse</h3>

<p class="tat">
The very opening word <em>tapaH</em> has diverse meanings. In a way it means <em>j~naana</em> acuity, 
and it is &#39;thinking&#39; <em>tap aalocane</em> &#39;thinking on the Absolute, where that Absolute&#39;s thinking 
itself is <em>tapaH - yasya j~naanam tapaH</em> thus Narada is one who is a constant thinker of the 
Absolute. Or, he who always practises <em>kR^icChrandraaayaNaadi vrataH - nitya naimittika karma anuSTHaana 
paraH</em> the rigorous practises enshrined in Veda-s. It means the Absolute itself <em>tapaH para brahma 
shabda vaca, brahmai tad upaastvai tat tapaH</em> &#39;that which is contemplated upon that is <em>tapaH</em>, 
meaning <em>Vedanta</em> , Upanishads. Let many Veda-s are learnt and recited mechanically it becomes 
a rote learning, unless, a thought is given as for what it is being recited, an on whom. Thus Narada 
has no rote learning, but still trying to get full picture of that Absolute. And the <em>swaadhyaya</em> 
is Veda, and its regular practise, <em>tapo hi svaadhyaayaH.</em> Veda itself is the Knowledge, that 
is why it is said <em>svadhyaan na pramiditavyam - taittariiya upaniSad</em> Then, it also means as 
the Absolute. Thus Narada being a complete embodiment of Veda-s, is the proper sage to clear the doubts 
of Valmiki</p>

<p class="tat">
The Divine Sage Narada is the brainchild of god Brahma <em>brahma maanasa putra.</em> His name has meanings 
like <em>naara</em> =knowledge; da= awarder; <em>naarada</em>= the rain cloud. Any cloud rains on its 
own without any requisition from Mother Earth. So Narada is <em>naaram dadaati iti naarada</em> &#39;one 
who accords knowledge concerning the humans...&#39; or, <em>naaram dyati - khaNdati - iti naarada</em> &#39;one 
who annihilates the ignorance...&#39; or, &#39;one who accords knowledge about the Absolute, or Supreme Person. 
Though a Divine Sage, having all these attributes, Narada has no conclusive information about <em>hari 
liilaa vibhuuti</em> &#39;Supreme Person&#39;s playful acts...&#39; hence he continuously and constantly ponders 
over that Absolute to get the real essence of that Absolute, or Supreme Person. This is for himself, 
and not in respect of his reacting with others.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then this word <em>vaak</em> means: enunciator - as given above; This word also means Veda - <em>anaadi 
nidhano hi eSaa vaak utshR^iSTaa</em> Veda-s emerged from that Absolute, hence <em>vaak</em> is identifiable 
with that Absolute; and this is grammar - <em>vaak yoga viddduSyati ca apashabde</em> as such <em>vaak</em> 
is identifiable with grammar. And <em>vaak vid vareNya</em> is &#39;one who has complete information derived 
from Veda-s, or, one who elucidates and enunciates what he has learned from Veda-s to others...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
There are four epithets of Narada here: <em>atha naaradasya catvaari visheShaNaani | 
tathaa - tapo nirati - iti anena visheShaNena sarva saamarthyam pratipaaditam | sva adhyaaya nirata 
- iti anena yat ki~ncit vadati tat veda ukta dharma anuguNatayaa eva vadati iti suucitam | vaak vidaam

- ca suucitam | taadR^isham naaradam bhagavaan vaalmiikiH sarva guNa samiShTi ruupam pururaSham - papR^iccha 
- dharmaakuutam</em></p>

<p class="tat">
<font>&#39;By these four epithets of Narada, viz., <em>tapo nirata</em> because he is a &#39;thoughtful-thinker 
evermore...&#39; his all-expertise in knowledge is proposed... <em>svaadhyaaya nirata</em> because he is 
&#39;eternally studious sage in scriptures [about the Truth and Untruth...&#39;] whatever the least he says 
it abides by the everlasting canonical sayings of Veda... <em>vaak vidaam vara</em> because his sayings 
are rooted in canons he is the best enunciator and elucidator... <em>muni pungava</em> because he is 
such a sublime sage he is transcendental... and as a traveller among all the three worlds he is aware 
of Truth and Untruth... and with such Sage Narada, Sage Valmiki enquired about a man, on earth, who 
is a composite in his form, for all merited endowments...&#39; Dharmaakuutam. This commentary is by Tryambakaraaya 
Makhi [1690&#39;s to 1728] and this can be called not just yet another commentary on Ramayana, but an Encyclopaedia 
of Indian Culture. This was published under the scheme of &#39;Editing and Publication if Rare Manuscripts, 
Govt. of India, Ministry of Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs&#39; and it is available with Tanjore 
Saraswati Mahal Library, Tanjavore, Tamil Nadu State, India.</font></p>

<p class="tat">
There are numerous and voluminous commentaries on Ramayana, bulkier than the epic itself, deciphering 
latent meanings of Ramayana as above. And to list a few of many commentaries on Ramayana: 1] <em>kataka 
vyaakhya,</em> by shrii katata; 2] <em>raamayaNa tilakam - raamaabhiraamii : by shrii naagojii bhaTT;</em> 
3] <em>raamaayaNa bhuuSaNam</em> by shrii govindaraja; 4] <em>raamaayaNa shiromaNi</em> by shrii shivasahaaya; 
5] <em>raamaayaNa tattva diipika</em> by shrii maheshvara tiirtha; 6] <em>raamaayaNa vyaakhya</em> shrii 
raamaanujaacaarya; 7] <em>viveka tilaka</em> by shrii varadaraaja; <em>dharmaakuutam</em> tryambakaraaya 
makhii; <em>raamaayaNa kuuTa vyaakhya</em> by shrii raamaananda tiirtha... and many, many more... Hence 
due to paucity of time we confine ourselves to some references from some of the above, as it will be 
uncouth to go on dwelling one these intricate derivation obtained by these great commentators.</p>

<p class="tat">
This stanza equally applies to Sage Valmiki, the taught, by way of the use of words <em>tapaH, svaadhyaaya, 
tapasvii,</em> thus both of them are experts in their own sphere of teacher-student relationship. The 
word <em>tapaH denotes</em> Veda-s themselves, in which both the Sages are well-versed, <em>svaadhyaaya</em> 
means, pondering over what that is learnt, i.e. <em>japa</em>. <em>tapasvii= sharanaagati</em> Total 
renunciation of their selves in the Almighty. Routine recitation of Veda-s will become futile if an 
iota of inclination in the Almighty and self-surrender to that Almighty is not there.
<em>tasmaannyeaasam eShaam tapasam atiriktam aahuH - taittatriiya naaraayaNam - 20</em> 
Hence, these two sages have commenced to deliver Ramayana, which itself is the epic of virtuous living, 
to this world.</p>

<p class="tat">
That being so, Valmiki is asking the same Narada as to who is Absolute-like, Absolute-similar or comparable 
human, with some of many traits of that Absolute. For this, Narada starts his narration with an exclamation
<em>bahavo durlabhaa ca guNaaH kiirtitaa</em> at seventh verse. Thus, there are bulky and voluminous 
commentaries on Ramayana, bulkier than the epic itself, hence due to paucity of time, and in eagerness 
to post the main epic firstly, let us take a pause in these declinations and niceties of verbiage, as 
it will be uncouth to go on dwelling on these intricate derivation at that staring itself.</p>

<p class="tat">
However, the epic starts with the word auspicious word <em>ta</em> as said in <em>ta kaaro vighna naashakaH, 
ta kaaro saukhya daayakaH...</em></p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>2. asmin loke</em> = in this, world; <em>saampratam</em> = presently; <em>guNavaan</em> = principled 
person; <em>kaH nu</em> = who is, really; <em>viiryavaan ca</em> = potential one, also; <em>kaH</em>

<p class="comment">
In Sanskrit poems the poets are at liberty to use words at any place according to exigencies of their 
metric rules. So, the order of words used by the poet called <em>pada vibhaaga</em> , in this poem is 
like this</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>kaH nu asmin saampratam loke guNavaan kaH ca viiryavaan dharma j~naH ca kR^ita j~naH ca satya vaakyaH 
dhR^iDha vrataH</em></p>

<p class="comment">
We have not shown this division of words for all verses in a separate paragraph, but separated them 
in the verse itself, [even if it gives a low-brow reading,] for fear of repetitive work.</p>

<p class="comment">
These very words are to be reconnected by readers to derive a particular meaning called <em>anvyaya 
krama</em>. By this process the words in this second verse will be connected like this:</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>asmin loke saamprataam guNavaan kaH nu; viiryaaan ca kaH; dharmaj~naH ca; kR^ita j~naH ca; satya vaakyaH 
dR^iDha vrataH; [ellipted]: kaH</em></p>

<p class="comment">
Same words available in the verse but with changed placement. All the verses are provided with word-to-word 
meanings in <em>anvya krama</em>, i.e., words parsed according to Sanskrit way of reading and then meanings 
are given.</p>

<p class="comment">
Further, we tried to give meanings in verse-by-verse in order to tell each on its own. But at times, 
the meaning rolls into next foots. Then it is inevitable to push and pull the feet of verses, up or 
down, to give a meaningful paragraph. Some of our readers are a little confused about this arrangement. 
Hence we request you to go by the verse numbers in such places, and there will be many such pulls and 
pushes as we go along.</p>

<p class="comment">
The meter filling words like <em>tu, hi ca, sma, ha, vai: paada puuraNe - amara kosha</em> do not usually 
mean anything and they fit-in as meter fillers, hence will be dropped in word-to-word meanings. But 
if they are used specifically, they play havoc in rendering meaning. Here the word <em>dharmaj~na</em> 
is used, which means, &#39;knower of rightness...&#39; but when coupled with <em>ca</em> it means &#39;also, the 
knower of wrongness... &#39; where the <em>ca</em> assumes the character of &#39;either...&#39; and the use of numerous
<em>ca</em>-s here in these questions of Valmiki, is to denote that every questioned merit plusses itself 
into one human being. We are showing all the <em>ca</em>-s and <em>tu</em>-s throughout, giving their 
meaning as &#39;also...&#39; and they may be dropped, if need be, in the gist of verse.</p>

3. <em>kaH chaaritreNa ca yuktaH</em> = who is, conduct-wise, also, blent with [good conduct]; <em>kaH

The adeptness of that person is in his knowing all the knowable aspects in this world, and he must be 
able to retain that knowledge to translate into his deeds, not just to sit back with his bookish knowledge, 
but with utmost practicality. His conduct-wise character shall be acceptable i.e., by his lineage he 
shall be noble, by his education he must be well-read, by his actions they must be conducive to norms 
laid down in Veda-s, and thus given any area, he should conduct himself properly. And he must be benign 
not only to higher-ups but to lowly subjects, like Guha, Shabari et al., and he should deal with wrongdoers 
and right-doers conscientiously. Further, he in his mien he shall be pleasant, but not an unsightly 
one. The word <em>eka</em> also means &#39;unique&#39; and thus his complexion, facial, physical structures

<p class="comment">
Valmiki wanted to know about that man - a man with godly qualities. Valmiki&#39;s thinking aloud, about 
the qualities of his prospective hero of this epic, is the very opening questions put to an Omniscient 
Sage Narada. Both the sages know of Rama and his deeds. Even then Valmiki asks Narada, &quot;who is that 
man with godly qualities?&#39; If Narada tells that Rama is Vishnu Himself, there is nothing left for Valmiki 
to compose his epic, because there are numerous mythologies, puraaNa-s, that have already adored God 
Vishnu. If Narada tells that Rama is so-and-so king, again Valmiki need not attempt to author about 
some king, however great that king might be. As such, Valmiki wanted to know about a human being with 
godly attributes, because many acts of Rama, like killing Vali, testing Seetha&#39;s chastity, deserting 
her at the end etc. are both conducive and contradictory puzzles.</p>

<p class="comment">
The attributes of the hero of Ramayana, as required by Valmiki, are 16; sixteen in number.<em>1 
- guNavaan 2 - viryavaan 3 - dharmaj~naH 4 - kR^itaj~naH 5 - satya vaakyaH 6 - dhR^iDha vrataH 7 - caaritra

krodhaH 14 - dyutimaan 15 - anasuuyakaH 16 - bibhyatidevaaH</em> These sixteen attributes are attributed 
to the sixteen phases of the Full Moon, and Valmiki is about to picture Rama to be as pleasant as a 
full-moon.</p>

Narada came hither to impart the legend of Rama, as Brahma already imparted the same to him, and wanted

<em>tam eva bhaantam anubhaati sarvam tasya bhaasaa sarvam idam bhaati</em> 2-11, Mundaka Upanishad. 
And the <em>dhR^ithimaan</em> is Sublime Bliss, according to Vyjanti <em>dhR^itiH tu tuSTiH santoSaH</em> 
and as said in <em>aanando brahama - aanandaat eva khalu imaani bhuutaani jaayante</em> 6, Taittariiya

bhuuta antaraatmaa</em> 2-5-12, Katha Upanishad and <em>sarvasya vashii sarvasya iishaanaH</em> and

of that Absolute in Creation, and the process of Creation is the self-expression of the Absolute.</p>

These are the ancillary subjects of Vedas called <em>anga</em> part and <em>upa anga</em> sub-part. 
The main parts of Veda-s are <em>siksha</em> ritual rigor <em>vyakarana</em> grammar <em>chandas</em> 
prosody <em>jyotish</em> astroloj~n <em>nirukta</em> recital rules <em>kalpa</em> procedure rules. This 
apart, the <em>dhanur veda</em> science of archery, itself is treated as &#39;an exclusive Veda taught to 
warriors...&#39; The <em>danur Veda</em> is not to be construed as simple bow and arrow and &#39;shooting the 
target&#39; education. It is a &#39;scripture on missiles&#39; that existed in those ages.</p>

<p class="comment">
Down the memory lane, O. A.Vijayan, the eminent Indian journalist has reflected in The Illustrated Weekly 
of India, that the Soviet scholar Dr. A. A. Gorbovsky said in his article with heading <em>Ancient India 
may have had N-arms</em> , in the Statesman, with dateline Moscow, Sept. 8, 1986. Among other things, 
the scientist observes by the stanzas that describe the disaster caused by such <em>astra-s,</em> now 
loosely termed as a well crafted bow and sky rocketing arrows, as below:</p>

<p class="comment">
<em>&#39;A blazing shaft which possessed all the effulgence of smokeless fire 
was let off... all directions were enveloped by darkness... the very elements seemed to be 
perturbed... the sun seemed to turn... the universe, scorched with heat, seemed to be in fever... 
the survivors lost their hair and nails... for years the sun and sky remained shrouded with 
clouds...&#39;</fem></p>

</em>

<p class="comment">
Thus the narration goes on. This is the account of <em>Brahma astra,</em> as in Maha Bharata, the other 
Epic of India. Thus the Dhanur Veda may be taken as the canon of missile sciences, which fortunately 
has not been handed over to the successive generations, lest everything would have been annihilated 
by now. In Ramayana too, which is much earlier to Mahabharata, there are elaborate accounts of such
<em>astra-s</em> in the coming chapters. Sage Vishvamitra, who is well-versed in warfare, gives many 
such weapons to Rama. For now, these bow and arrow references may not be taken as those of Robin Hood.</p>

<p class="comment">
At times Rama is said to be &#39;the son of Kausalya...&#39; than the son Dasharatha, because the word Kausalya 
does not signify his mother alone, the daughter of King of Kosala, but it has meanings like <em>kshema, 
kushala, saamarthya, puNya, nipuNatva</em> &#39;safeness, soundness, capability, merit, expertise...&#39; and 
this also signifies Queen Kausalya&#39;s worshipping of Vishnu. When dynasty, valour, braveness etc., are 
said, Rama&#39;s name will be attached with Dasharatha. An ocean is not a bottomless one but an unfathomable 
one. So also Rama&#39;s heart has a reachable bottom, where pearls, gems, and other treasures of virtues 
are abounding, and it can be reached with a heartily approach. For a hard-hearted one Rama&#39;s heart becomes 
an unfathomable abyss and he will get lost in it. <em>girayoH varSha dhaaraabhir haryamaanaa

get hassled though subjected to many problems, for they place their faith in the Supreme. Equally, mountains 
are unshaken though battered by storms or lightings...&#39; So, like a mountain he is unalterable and constant 
for a true devotee. An icy-mountain is meltable by scorching sun, thus Rama also melts down when his

Readers may find an inordinate use of ellipses in translation of the epic. But they are &#39;a must.&#39; Pt. 
Satya Vrat, the author of <em>Ramayana - A Linguistic Study</em> says: &quot;Ellipsis is the peculiarity 
of the style of the older works like Ramayana... their writings, as they stood, yielded incomplete sense 
which has to be supplemented by <em>adhyaadhaara</em>, viz., supply of words, that would fit in the 
context... Indeed, in most cases the ellipsis could be readily understood and would suggest the word 
or words that would make it up...&#39; We therefore request the readers to go by the meaning of the context, 
than by the order of words, for there is a saying... <em>paaTha krame artha kramo baliiyaH...</em> So, 
this <em>adhyaadhaara</em>, supply of words, may not be that faithful while rendering from Sanskrit

<p class="comment">
Here <em>deva maaya</em> refers to many concepts. Vaishnavaite tenets tell that the word <em>deva</em> 
is ascribable only to Vishnu, but not to other gods. Thus, this is <em>Vishnu maya</em>, when He assumed 
an extraordinary female form called Mohini, when distributing <em>amR^ita</em>, the divine elixir, to 
gods and demons. Next is the form of Tilottama, a divine beauty to hoodwink demons called Sunda and 
Upasunda. The other is Vishnu&#39;s <em>liilaa shakti</em>, which is divinely fascinating. Yet another is 
grammatical connotation, <em>maa yaa</em> where, <em>maa</em>= Goddess Lakshmi; <em>yaa</em>= who that 
is; meaning <em>yaa siitaa saa maa</em>= &#39;who is Goddess Lakshmi... She is Seetha...&#39; and this results 
in the saying: <em>ati ruupavatii siitaa... ati muurkhaH cha raavaNa</em> &#39;While Seetha is an extraordinarily 
beauty, Ravana is an eccentrically stupid...</p>

<p class="comment">
The deities have their wives always with them. Chandra, the Moon has Rohini, a conspicuous star, while 
Surya, Sun has Prabha, Sunshine. Minus these wives, their glow and glitter is void. So also, Rama has 
an inseparable wife. Though Seetha and Lakshmana were not exiled, they followed Rama out of concept 
of &#39;togetherness...&#39;</p>

Here while saying <em>guhena saH hitaH raamaH</em> can also be cleaved as <em>guhena saH hitaH = saH 
raamaH guhena hitaH</em> &#39;he that Rama is sent, or sailed over Ganga by Guha...&#39; apart from the above. 
The word Sringaberapura means a township where the replicas of stags with sets of antlers are prepared 
and placed at places in order to attract selfsame stags or deer, and then the tribals can catch those 
animals. The word Guha means <em>guhaati it guhaH</em> &#39;one who hordes/steals others&#39; wealth by waylaying 
etc...&#39; thus, though the tribal chief is a lowly subject by birth and caste-oriented activity, Rama 
has no aversion for such subjects, because Guha reposes love in Rama. Govindaraja.</p>

The word asura is declined as asuuna raati iti asura... <em>asu</em> = life; <em>ra</em>= taker; i.e., 
life takers - demons, while the word <em>sura</em> is nectar consuming one, the divine. In later chapters

This is metonymy. Rama did not do it himself, but his brother Lakshmana does this act of cutting the 
nose and ears of this demoness, which is the twisting point of the story. She is so named as Shuurpanakha 
because her like fingernails are like winnowing fans, <em>shuurpa tulya nakhaa iti shuurpanakha; shuurpa</em>= 
winnowing fan; <em>tulya</em> = like; <em>nakhaa</em> = fingernails. She is the sister of Ravana, and

Next verse onwards the episodes in Kishkindha are introduced. Now Rama meets Hanuma, the Vaanara. Traditionally 
this character is taken as a monkey god. <em>vanena</em>= in forests, <em>charati</em>= moves about,
<em>iti</em>= thus; therefore <em>vaanara</em> = &#39;forest-ranger&#39; is the declination of the term. It 
neither means an absolute monkey-hood nor absolute god-hood, but these vanara-s are the great characters 
in this epic, humanoid forest ranging monkey-humans. These Vanara-s have their rich traditions, which 
we will come across in Kishkindha Kanda proper. For now they may be taken as great heroes, but hereinafter 
referred to as &#39;monkeys&#39; or &#39;vanara-s&#39; for an easy comprehension and in a customary way.</p>

Vali, the elder brother of Sugreeva, is another principle character of Ramayana. He is capable of rendering

Ravana is subdued by Vali&#39;s strength. As a preamble to the incident of eliminating mighty Ravana in

ninety miles, only with a flip of his foot-toe&#39;s tip. But Sugreeva continued his grumbling, &#39;in those 
days this skeleton was with flesh and blood, now it became weight-less, thus show me more of your show

yoking. Chambers dictionary puts it as five miles, and it is disagreeable for it is British-Indian revenue 
measure. Traditionally it is four krosha-s and thus each yojana is nine to ten miles. This is amplified

When it is said that &#39;women are un-widowed and their husbands are ever living...&#39; Dasharatha&#39;s widows 
can be pointed to contradict this statement. But it is said &#39;when a woman is with her son/sons living, 
though her husband dies, she is still a &#39;wife of somebody...&#39; thus she is still un-widowed.</p>

In <em>rama raajyam upaasitvaa...</em> the word used is <em>upaasana</em> is not ruling by sceptre but 
it is &#39;reverentially idolising the kingdom...&#39; as one would regard or treat his personal god with reverence. 
Rama thus reverenced his kingdom as a devotee of his subjects and this is the concept of <em>raama raajya</em>.
