Prose Sarga 21</h3>

<p class="txt">The ire of sage Vishvamitra is shown at king Dasharatha. To pacify sage Vishvamitra, 
sage Vashishta intervenes and convinces king Dasharatha to send Rama with sage Vishvamitra. While doing 
so, sage Vashishta enumerates the capabilities of sage Vishvamitra, his knowledge of weaponry. Vashishta 
also suggests that all those weapons will be given to Rama, if Rama is dispatched with Vishvamitra. 
At last, Dasharatha agrees to send Rama.</p>

<p class="verloc">----.</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">On hearing the wavery words of Dasharatha that are full of fond for his son, Vishvamitra 
wrathfully replied this sentence to the king. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;On promising me to fulfil my object in the first instance you wish to repudiate it now, 
undeserving is this kind of deviation for the kings of Raghava dynasty. If this is worth while to you, 
oh, king, I wish to go away as I have come, and you with your feigned promises be nonchalantly happy 
with your kinsmen.&quot; So said Vishvamitra to the king. </p>

<p class="tat">When that prudent sage Vishvamitra is thus enwrapped in fury, then the whole earth trembled 
and the gods are scared. On knowing the appalled appearance of the entire world at the fury of Vishvamitra, 
Vashishta the great sage with high vows and an insightful one too, said these words to the king. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Born in Ikshwaku dynasty you are apparently the other god of ethics on earth, a staunch 
one with righteous vows and a glorious one too, such as you are, it will be unapt of you to forsake 
ethics. In three worlds you are renowned as the right-minded one, oh, Raghava, hence adhere to your 
own uprightness, and adhering to unrighteousness will be unapt of you. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Promising to effectuate something in any way and not effectuating the given word results 
in the perdition to the merits of <font color=" #B3003A">iSTapurta </font>Vedic rituals, hence oh, Raghava, 
leave hold of Rama. </p>

<p class="comment">In some Vedic rituals activates for social service are undertaken, and they are known 
as <em>iSTaapuurta </em>rituals, in which digging wells, lakes and other social facilities will be undertaken.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Whether Rama is trained in weaponry or not, demons cannot trounce Rama as long as Kushi&#39;s 
son Vishvamitra protects him, like the heavenly firewall that protects divine nectar. </p>

<p class="comment">In heaven an unapproachable firewall encircles the vessel of ambrosia protecting 
it from thieving by the demons.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;He is an embodiment of virtue, matchless among the venturesome, peerless in intellect 
among all in the world, and flawless in ascesis. He is in the know-how of various missiles, and no other 
person is there in the triad of worlds, inclusive of sessile and mobile worlds, who is knowledgeable 
about him, or someone who can know him will be there in future, excepting myself. Gods cannot know Vishvamitra, 
and anybody from sages – no; immortals- no; demons – no; the gandharva-s and eminent yaksha-s together 
with the kinnaraa-s and great reptile beings – no, they cannot know him. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;All the missiles known to Vishvamitra are the highly righteous children of Krishaasva 
Prajapati, where Prajapati-s were the earliest ruler of mankind, and god Shiva gave them to Vishvamitra 
when was ruling kingdom. Those missiles are the sons of Daksha Prajaapati&#39;s daughters and her husband 
Krishaasva Prajapati, and they are disparate in their form, intrepid, dazzling, and victory-oriented 
missiles. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Jaya and Suprabha, the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, endowed with best waists gave 
birth to a hundred missiles and weaponry whose flare is supreme. On getting a boon Jaya named wife of 
Krishaasva Prajapati is benefited with fifty best and formless sons with immeasurable fortitude for 
the destruction of ungodly beings. Suprabha, another wife of Krishaasva Prajapati, gave birth to another 
fifty unassailable, unconquerable and mighty sons named the Eliminators. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;And this sage Vishvamitra is in the precise know of the said missiles, and this principled 
one is also capable of creating hitherto unavailable missiles. Thereby, oh, Raghava, nothing whatsoever 
is unknown to this great-souled Vishvamitra, who is a distinguished sage and the knower of virtue, either 
that has happened or that is happening. Thus, the highly renowned and great resplendent sage Vishvamitra 
has this sort of enterprise, oh, king, allowing a doubt enter your mind in Rama&#39;s accompanying the sage 
will be unapt of you. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;This son of Kushi, Vishvamitra, can as well control those demons by himself, but intending 
to accord beneficence to your son he approached you and imploring upon you. </p>

<p class="tat">Thus the prominent king from Raghu dynasty, namely Dasharatha, became serene-minded by 
sage Vashishta&#39;s words, and he who is supreme among other kings and who has pronounced renown, that 
Dasharatha then gladly and wholeheartedly consented to the travel of Rama along with the sage Vishvamitra.
