<p class="txt">Sage Vishvamirtra narrates the legend of Sagara, the earliest King of Ayodhya and Rama&#39;s 
forefather. His childlessness and begetting sixty thousand sons of merit and one son of demerit are 
narrated. Later King Sagara proceeds with the performance of a Vedic-ritual.</p>

<p class="tat">On describing that legend of Skanda / Kaartikeya, Vishvamitra, the descendent of Kaushika, 
spoke this, again with his melodious words to Rama, the descendent of Kakutstha... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Once there was a King of Ayodhya, oh, valiant Rama, who is brave and virtue-souled, 
namely Sagara... but he was without offspring... as such he also longed for offspring... The daughter 
of King of Vidarbha, by name named as Keshini, was the eldest wife of Sagara, and she was virtue-minded, 
and an advocate of truth... The daughter of Arishtanemi, who is also the sister of Garuda, [the Divine-Eagle- 
vehicle of of Vishnu,] is the second wife of Sagara, who is known as Sumati... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;That great King Sagara along with his two wives, on reaching the Himalayan Mountains, 
he practised asceticism, on a mountain called Brugu-parsravana... </p>

<p class="comment">Comment: The Mount among Himalayan range on which the kindness of Sage Bhrigu is 
ever- flowing.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Then, after the lapse of a hundred years of practising asceticism and worshiping, the 
Sage Bhrugu who is a prominent one among the patrons of truth, bestowed a boon to Sagara... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;Oh, Merited one, you will achieve very admirable progeny... and oh, best man, you 
even acquire an unparalleled renown in the world... One wife of yours mothers a son, who enriches your 
dynasty... and the other, mothers sixty thousand sons...&quot; Said Sage Bhrigu. </p>

<p class="tat">On that saying of Sage Bhrigu thus, the daughters of kings [of Vidarbha and Aristanemi,] 
became regardful of that great souled sage and spoke very cheerfully, adjoining the planes of their 
palms, in supplication...</p>

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;Which of us bears one son, oh, Brahman, which of us begets numerous sons... we two 
wish to listen about that, oh, Brahman... let your word betide truth...&#39; Thus, the queens of Sagara 
spoke to the sage.</p>

<p class="tat">On listening their words the Sage Bhrigu spoke in a glorious tone, &quot;Let your freewill 
be brought to bear this issue and choose among yourselves...&#39; Said Sage Bhrigu.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;Either, one dynasty-enriching son in one, or, numerous ones with great enthusiasm 
and prominence, in the other... who desires to have which boon...&#39; Thus, the Sage gave them the option.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;On listening the words of the sage, oh, delight of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, Keshini, in the 
presence of King Sagara, chosen one son, that enriches the dynasty. Sumati, the sister of mighty-winged 
Garuda, chosen sixty thousand sons of great enthusiasm and reputation. On performing circumambulations 
to the Sage Bhrigu, also reverencing him head-bent, oh, Raghu&#39;s scion, the King Sagara proceeded to 
his own city along with wives.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Then, after a lapse of some time the elder wife Keshini gave birth to the son of Sagara, 
who is Asamanja, [of ill-] repute. But Sumati, oh, Tigerly-man, verily delivered a neonate [who is round 
and long like a single] gourd... but on breaking it up, sixty thousand sons are issued forth from that 
cucumber. The childminders brought those siblings up well, in vessels filled with ghee [clarified butter,] 
and after a protracted time all of them attained youthfulness. </p>

<p class="tat">After a long time, those sixty thousand sons of King Sagara thus became youthful with 
their hand-some aspects. The elder son of the King Sagara, namely Asamanja, oh, Rama, the best of men, 
on grabbing the children, he was hurling into the waters of River Sarayu. He, the elder son of Sagara, 
namely, Asamanja, always used to hurl the children in the river waters of Sarayu, and looked attentively 
and laughingly at them while they were immersing... this way, he with his sinister activity, became 
a torturer of goodmen... </p>

<p class="comment">Comment: This Asamanja appears to be the person from the first-generation of sadistic 
child abusers, prior to Kamsa of Bhagavata.</p>

<p class="tat">Thus, his father King Sagara expatriated Asamanja for his undesirable activities towards 
citizens... but that Asamanja had a valorous son by name Anshuman. That Anshuman was an acceptable one 
for all the people as he talks dearly with all the people. Then, after a long time, a great thought 
chanced to Sagara.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh, Rama, Best of men, then he that Veda-knowing King Sagara, inclined to perform Vedic-ritual 
took the decision accordingly, and then with the assemblages of his religious-teachers, he proceeded 
to perform the proceedings of Vedic-ritual... </p>
