			<p class="txt">
			Legend of Shiva&#39;s bow is narrated as Vishvamitra asks Janaka to show 
			that bow to Rama and Lakshmana, as they have come this far to have a 
			glimpse of that great bow. Janaka, while narrating its history, makes 
			an offer saying that his daughter Seetha will be given in marriage, 
			if only Rama can string the bowstring of Shiva&#39;s bow. In the very same 
			sixty-sixth chapter of Kishkindha Kanda, Valmiki narrates the birth 
			of Hanuma through Jambavanta, elaborately. But here Valmiki informs 
			through Janaka about the nature of birth of Seetha, very concisely, 
			which gave raise to too much of debate about this enigmatic Seetha and 
			her birth. Some points are given in the endnote.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then on performing morning time rites in the aurora of next morning, king Janaka 
invited great souled Vishvamitra, along with Raghava-s. On reverencing Vishvamitra 
and the noble souled Raghava-s according to the formalities envisaged by scriptures, 
then the virtue souled Janaka spoke these words, indeed.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, god, you are welcome, oh, holy sage, bid me as to what I should for you, for 
I am biddable by you, indeed...&quot; So said Janaka.</p>

<p class="tat">
When said thus by the foreseer Janaka, who can foresee as to why Vishvamitra came 
with Raghava-s this far, and thus asked him as to what next is to be done, that 
sage Vishvamitra, for he is presager and wordsmith, and who knows what is to be 
done next, said these words in reply to that valiant king Janaka.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;These two are the sons of Dasharatha, well-renowned Kshatriya-s in world, and they 
are desirous to see that marvellous bow which has a place with you... You may show 
that bow, well bodes you, and on beholding that bow the desire of these two princes 
will come true, and they will go back as they like...&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">
But Janaka replied the great sage Vishvamitra when he was addressed thus, &quot;I shall 
firstly tell by which reason that bow has its place here... Oh, godly sage, there 
was a king renowned as Devaraata, sixth one from Nimi, the originator of our lineage, 
and this bow was handed down to him for custodial care by the Sublime Soul, Shiva...</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: Some mms use the word <em>jyeSTaH </em>instead of <em>SaSTa </em>for Nimi 
and then the meaning is that Nimi&#39;s eldest son is Devaraata. Basing on the account 
that is given by Janaka at the time of Rama&#39;s mariage with Seetha, Devaraata is 
the sixth one from Nimi, the originator of Janaka&#39;s lineage.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Once, during the devastation of the Vedic-ritual of Daksha Prajapati, the mettlesome 
god Rudra, rancorously outstretching the bowstring of this bow, said this to all 
gods, superciliously...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, gods, whereby you have not apportioned my portion of oblations in Vedic-ritual 
s, as I am also the desirer of such portion, thereby I will shred the highly revered 
heads of yours with this bow...&#39; So said Shiva to gods.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then, oh, best saint Vishvamitra, all gods are truly dismayed, and on their supplicating, 
Bhava, namely Shiva, the God of Gods is gladdened... And that Sublime Soul Shiva 
gladly gave that bow to all of the great souled gods, and oh, godly saint, then 
those great souled gods gave this gem of a bow of Shiva, the God of Gods, to our 
ancestor Devaraata, for custodial care...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Later, when I was ploughing the ritual field then raised by the plough from the 
furrow is a baby girl... since she is gained while consecrating the ritual-field, 
she is named as Seetha, and thus she is renowned...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Hers is a non-uterine birth as she surfaced from the surface of the earth, but 
fostered as my own soul-born girl and I determined to giver her in marriage to a 
bridegroom where his boldness is the only bounty, I receive in that marriage...</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: &#39;Dowry is property or money brought by a bride to her husband&#39; and this 
is familiar throughout the world. In ancient India, there was a counterpart custom 
to this, called <em>kanyaa shulkam </em>meaning &#39;some bounty, property or money 
offered by a bridegroom&#39;s family to the bride&#39;s family&#39; since they are getting a 
worthy bride, coming into their family, not just as a mere wife of the bridegroom, 
but to upkeep and promote that family and its progeny. And this dowry or its counterpart 
is not compulsorily be paid in hard cash, but it may be any kind of gifts mutually 
exchanged, which has slowly developed into a mega havoc these days. Here Janaka 
wants the &#39;valour&#39; of his prospective son-in-law as bounty due to him in the marriage 
of Seetha.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, eminent sage, as my daughter has surfaced from the surface of earth and has 
come of age, the kings, having heard my declaration that the bounty for Seetha is 
boldness alone, have come and besought for her... To all of those kings who are 
beseeching for the girl, I have not given my daughter, saying that she will be given 
for a bounty of boldness... Then all the kings convoked and on arriving at Mithila, 
then they wanted to ascertain the calibre of the bow, vis-Ã -vis their own...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;For them, those who wanted to ascertain the calibre of the bow, that bow of Shiva 
is fetched to their proximity, but they are incapable to joggle it, or even to catch 
hold of it...</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: This bow of Shiva will be transported on a wheeled casket-cart with eight 
wheels and drawn by five thousand robust persons. This is narrated in next chapter. 
&#39;It is drawn by drawn by five hundred bulls...&#39; <em>aananda raamayana </em>says 
so. In other versions of Ramayana, it is said that many people will pull that casket-cart, 
as one or two persons cannot haul it. Once, when Seetha was playing with other girls, 
their flowery ball of girl&#39;s rugby goes under this cart. None of her girlfriends 
is dare enough to near this bow-casket-cart, since it is a reverential casket-cart. 
But Seetha goes there and pushes that casket-cart aside with her left hand, as though 
it is a garland, and retrieves that flower ball. This capability of Seetha in easy 
handling of Shiva&#39;s bow, becomes a bane to her, when one among the wives of <em>
sapta R^iSi </em>&#39;Seven Sages...&#39; issues a curse to Seetha, saying that &#39;Seetha 
will be separated from her husband for some time, of course, for the good of people...&#39; 
So says the tradition.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, great saint, on knowing the valour of those valorous ones as valueless, I countermanded 
them... oh, ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra, by that you may know the sequel of 
it... Then, oh, eminent sage, those kings beleaguered Mithila in a blind fury, since 
a self-mistrust bechanced among them all, about their own valour...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;They surmised for themselves that they are brushed off by me, and they possessed 
by a high rancour, they strangled the City of Mithila... Then elapsed is an year 
and in anyway the possessions for livelihood went into a decline, oh, eminent sage, 
thereby I am highly anguished</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then I have assuaged the assemblages of gods by my ascesis and gods are also highly 
gladdened and gave me fourfold forces...</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: The four components of army are foot soldiers, cavalry, elephant-squadrons, 
and chariot-warriors.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then those evildoers and self-mistrustful kings while being drubbed by the heaven-sent 
army, they have become vigourless and broken, and they beat a hasty retreat... Oh, 
tigerly sage this is that supremely radiant bow, and oh, saint of sacred vows, I 
will show it, even to Rama and Lakshmana...</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: Here by the use of word &#39;even&#39; &#39;also&#39; Janaka is reckoning Rama or Lakshmana 
on par with other kings who have tried their hand in lifting it. As of now, Janaka 
is not admitting any supremeness or super-humanness to them. In Janaka&#39;s asking 
at verse 4 &#39;what can I do next...&#39; etc., Janaka has sensed as to why this Vishvamitra 
brought some boys on this long a route, that too by foot. But he is not yet self-assured 
of Rama&#39;s capability or otherwise. Hence, the next verse starts with the clause 
&#39;if&#39;.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;If Rama strings the bowstring of that bow, oh, sage, I will offer my daughter, 
whose birth is non-uterine, to Dasharatha&#39;s Rama...&quot; So said Janaka to Vishvamitra.

Enigmatic Seetha and her enigmatic birth</p>

<p class="comment">
In the endnote of Ch. 56 of Aranya Kanda, some details are given about the enigmatic 
Seetha. Here also some points about her enigmatic birth are presented.</font></p>

<p class="comment">
In a book of O&#39;Flaherty, Wendy D. Textual Sources for the Study of Hinduism. Pub: 
University of Chicago Press. ISBN 0-226-61847-1. p.59, Ramayana 1:65, Devanagari 
manuscript w-1455,&#39; it is written that: &quot;[Janaka:] &#39;Now, one day when I was in the 
sacrificial grounds, I saw the ultimate celestial nymph, Menaka, flying through 
the sky, and this thought came to me: &#39;If I should have a child in her, what a child 
that would be!&#39; As I was thinking in this way, my semen fell on the ground. And 
afterwards, as I was ploughing that field, there arose out of the earth, as first 
fruits, my daughter, who has celestial beauty and qualities, and can only be won 
by one whose bride price is his manliness. Since she arose from the surface of the 
earth, and was born from no womb, she is called Sita, the furrow.&#39; &quot;</font></p>

<p class="comment">
And this is said to be in Valmiki Ramayana, and this is being used to justify &#39;the 
virtually illicit birth of Sita, Lord Rama&#39;s wife&#39; - it is unclear as to why and 
how scholars, as above, are wading through backwaters, called ancillary scripts, 
in the name of Valmiki Ramayana, and slinging mud on Valmiki or his Ramayana. It 
would be better to check and recheck their source material for this statement, if 
it were to be Valmiki Ramayana, on reading the verses 13, 14 and the last one of 
this chapter, where it is said that the birth of Seetha is a
<font color="#B3003A">non-uterine birth</font>, as there is neither a Menaka, nor 
a woman, nor any semen.</font></p>

<p class="comment">
Seetha is considered to be the <font color="#B3003A">nature&#39;s nature, Primordeal 
Nature, mahaa prakriti</font>, and when the five elements of nature intermingle 
into one, that is the Manifest Nature, where the five elements are
<font color="#B3003A">pridhvi, aapa, teja, vaayu, aakaasha</font> &#39;earth, waters, 
fire, air and space...&#39; and there are many theories of their commingling like,
<font color="#B3003A">pachii karaNa, saptii karaNa</font> quintuplication, and sevenfold 
commingling etc. The process of creation gives rise to 24 items: 1] empirical or 
fundamental matter, 2] mahat, 3] ahamkaara, 4-8] five subtle elements, 9-13] five 
gross elements, 14] mind, 15-19] five sense organs, 20-24] five motor organs, 25] 
jiiva aatma, individual&#39;s soul, 26] Brahman, The Absolute. With these, a created 
living being is created. This is in the case of mortals and their births. But when 
Seetha is found in the furrow all these things have already happened and there is 
no question of human pregnancy to be attached to her. Hence Seetha is to be taken 
as Goddess Lakshmi, who is <font color="#B3003A">paraa shakti, Vishnu Maya</font> 
and when she has to take an incarnation to become the prime cause to the effect 
of eliminating Ravana, no human activity of reproduction can be attached to such 
beings. If she were to be a human, perhaps she would not have exited from the pyre 
of fire when she self-immolated, after Rama and Ravana war. Some more information, 
though unrelated to Valmiki Ramayana, is given hereunder.</font></p>

Lakshmi evolved from the Milky Ocean, when gods and demons churned it for

<p class="comment">
Vishnu is the all-inclusive deity, known as <font color="#B3003A">purusha</font> 
or <font color="#B3003A">mahaa puruSa... parama aatma</font> Supreme Person,
<font color="#B3003A">naraayaNa</font> one who peregrinates mortals in and out this 
mortal world, <font color="#B3003A">antaryAmi</font> The In-dweller of all beings, 
and He is the <font color="#B3003A">sheshin</font> the Totality, in whom all souls 
are contained. He is <font color="#B3003A">bhagavat</font> where
<font color="#B3003A">bhaga</font>, derives from the root <font color="#B3003A">
bhaj</font> meaning Gracious Lord, and <font color="#B3003A">vat</font> one who 
has it. Vishnu possesses six such divine glories <font color="#B3003A">SaD guna 
vibhuuti</font>, namely, 1] <font color="#B3003A">j~naana</font>, Omniscience 2]
<font color="#B3003A">aishwarya</font>, Providence, 3] <font color="#B3003A">shakti</font>, 
Omnicompetence, 4] <font color="#B3003A">bala</font>, Omnipotence, 5]
<font color="#B3003A">viirya</font>, Immutability. 6] <font color="#B3003A">tejas</font>, 
Resplendence, <font color="#B3003A">shakti</font> is the <font color="#B3003A">samvit</font>, 
the Primary Intelligence of God, while the other five attributes emerge from this
<font color="#B3003A">samvid</font> and hence <font color="#B3003A">shakti</font> 
is the god&#39;s <font color="#B3003A">ahamata</font> Personality and Activity. Thus 
this Shakti of god is personified in mythological lore and is called Shri or Lakshmi, 
and She is said to manifest herself in, 1] <font color="#B3003A">kriyaa shakti</font>, 
Creative Activity and 2] <font color="#B3003A">bhuuti shakti</font>, Creation of 
God. Hence Vishnu cannot part with His own personality or creativity i.e.,
<font color="#B3003A">ahamta</font>, which in its feminine form is called
<font color="#B3003A">shrii</font> or <font color="#B3003A">Lakshmi</font>. He therefore 
needs His consort Goddess Lakshmi to be with Him always, untouched by any. Thus, 
Goddess Lakshmi has to accompany Vishnu in all His incarnations, along with other 
paraphernalia like his conch-shell, his quoit and mace, and the thousand headed 
serpent <font color="#B3003A">aadi sheSa</font> etc. Such a delightful deity Goddess 
Lakshmi is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, but she is fickle 
like ripples <em>lakShmii hi toya taranga capalaa</em> Lakshmi= Goddess Lakshmi; 
hi= indeed; toya= water; taranga= wave like; capalaa= wavering. &#39;Goddess Lakshmi 
is wavering like the waves of water...&#39; <font color="#B3003A">chapala, chanchala, 
asthira</font>, wavering, faltering, unstable, and <font color="#B3003A">maayaa, 
maa + yaa</font> &#39;whose illusory play she is, or <font color="#B3003A">liila</font> 
play of god. She comes in unnoticeably like the water in a coconut and evaporates 
innocently into thin air, at Her will. Such as she is she is easily grabbed by the 
greedy. Hence none can give birth to her except the Mother Nature, and hence she 
is called <font color="#B3003A">mahilaa ; mahi + laa</font> where
<font color="#B3003A">mahi</font> is earth and <font color="#B3003A">laa ; laH khaNDane 
triSu aadaane stri</font> because Mother Earth gave birth to Seetha, Seetha is
<font color="#B3003A">mahila</font> Hence it is better to avoid assuming her to 
be an ordinary lady of an ordinary birth, and she may be viewed either legendarily 
or mythologically, for Valmiki as an epical poet, himself has not chronicled the 
details of her birth.</font></p>

<p class="comment">
Even Vishnu is deprived of Her in His incarnations, not only in Ramayana but also 
in His <font color="#B3003A">nR^i simha</font> Man-Lion incarnation. There, Maya 
Lakshmi becomes a tribal woman to bring back the ferocious Lion-Man to his original 
form. And in other versions of Ramayana, it is said that Ravana abducted Maya Seetha, 
but not real Seetha. &#39;When the real Seetha herself is an enigma, what if Ravana 
abducts real or duplicate copy of that Seetha...&#39; is the brushed aside adjustment. 
In either case, it is <font color="#B3003A">maya, liila</font> illusory power, sport 
of Vishnu together with that of Goddess Lakshmi, cause this enigma. Hence, whenever 
She is thus absconding from Him, Vishnu searches and retrieves Her, for no one in 
Universe can handle her, nor amass all the wealth. The predestined wealth alone 
is enjoyable but nothing more can be amassed. So also are the riches in the present 
day world, come too suddenly and vanish that suddenly. No one is rich ever and anon, 
and on someday every one is likely to see the ups and downs in his graph of riches. 
It is Vishnu that retrives the real wealth back to His abode
<font color="#B3003A">Vaikuntha</font>, and even punishes anyone for his accumulation 
of beyond-the-means-wealth. The burning of Lanka by Hanuma in Sundara Kanda is an 
example to this.</font></p>

<p class="comment">
In <font color="#B3003A">Lakshmi tantra</font> , a <font color="#B3003A">Vaishnavaite 
aagama</font> text, She that unrestrainable Goddess Lakshmi declares Herself, as
<font color="#B3003A">naaraayaNii, vaiSNavii</font> i.e., a coequal of Vishnu, in 
the play of the universe i.e., in God&#39;s <font color="#B3003A">liila</font>, saying

<p class="comment">
The Hindu mythology bases more on its eighteen Puraana-s, each of the six is rendered 
to each of the Hindu Trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. A]
<font color="#B3003A">Vishnu Puraana-s</font> are: - <font color="#B3003D">1] Vishnu, 
2] bhaagavata, 3] naaradiiya, 4] garuda, 5] padma. 6] varaaha.</font> B]
<font color="#B3003A">Brahma Puraana-s</font> : -<font color="#B3003D">1] Brahma, 
2] brahmaanda, 3] brahma vaivarta, 4] maarkandeya, 5] bhaviSya,6] vaamana.</font> 
C] <font color="#B3003A">Shiva Puraana-s</font> : - <font color="#B3003D">1] vaayu, 
2] linga, 3] skanda, 4] agni, 5] matsya, 6] kuurma</font>. In all these Puraana-s 
Goddess Lakshmi is given a laudable place without any sectarian dispute. In the 
Vaishnavaite Puraana-s, Shiva starts telling the efficacy of Vishnu to Goddess Parvati. 
While Shaiva mythology places Goddess Parvati, the consort of Shiva, in one half 
of Shiva&#39;s body <font color="#B3003A">artha naariishvara tattva</font>, and Vaishnavaite 
tradition places Goddess Lakshmi in the heart of Vishnu itself, as if it is a Lotus
<font color="#B3003A">hridaya kamala</font>. This is to depict the inseparable unison 
of Universal <font color="#B3003A">purusha</font>, Male and
<font color="#B3003A">prakriti</font> , Female, the seed and field.</font></p>

<p class="comment">
While Valmiki Ramayana names Rama as Rama, the Padma Puraana etc., mythological 
texts bring in the Vedic texts and prefix <font color="#B3003A">shrii</font> of
<font color="#B3003A">shrii suukta</font> of Rig Veda khila 5-87, which is a feminine 
counterpart of <font color="#B3003A">puruSa suukta</font> of Rig Veda 10-90, for
<font color="#B3003A">parama purusha</font> i.e., Vishnu or Narayana, and thus call 
Rama of Valmiki as <font color="#B3003A">shrii raama</font>. Vaishnavaite mythologies 
take hold of these and other Vedic references to Vishnu, and treat Vishnu / Narayana 
and Lakshmi as the inseparable divine couple, who maintain this Universe. The prefix
<font color="#B3003A">shrii</font> means as &#39;one who takes delight in
<font color="#B3003A">shrii</font> i.e., Lakshmi, meaning wealth, wealth of any 
kind. <font color="#B3003A">shrii riti prathamam naama lakshmyaa</font> and &#39; if
<font color="#B3003A">a</font> is the first name of Vishnu,
<font color="#B3003A">shrii</font> is the first name of Lakshmi. Thus, primarily 
eight kinds of wealth are established, to be associated with Goddess Lakshmi. They 
are 1] <font color="#B3003A">aadi Lakshmi</font> Wealth a priori 2]
<font color="#B3003A">dhaanya Lakshmi</font> Cereal Wealth 3]
<font color="#B3003A">Dhairya Lakshmi</font> Wealth of Courage 4]
<font color="#B3003A">gaja Laksmi</font> Elephant Wealth, i.e., Elephantine Wealth 
of all animals and livestock, <font color="#B3003A">santaana Lakshmi</font> Wealth 
of Progeny, 6] <font color="#B3003A">vijaya Lakshmi</font>, Wealth of Victory, 7]
<font color="#B3003A">vidyaa Lakshmi</font> Wealth of Education, 8]
<font color="#B3003A">dhana Lakshmi</font> Monetary Wealth. And any thing that need 
be affluent gets the auspicious prefix <font color="#B3003A">shrii</font> or suffix
<font color="#B3003A">lakshmi</font>, and called <font color="#B3003A">raajya Lakshmi</font> 
, Wealth of Empire, <font color="#B3003A">bhaagya lakshmi</font> Wealth of Fortune, 
and the like...</font></p>

<p class="comment">
The play of Goddess Lakshmi in the form of Seetha is Ramayana. As such, her absence 
from Rama caused Rama to travel up to Lanka, annihilate the evil, and retrieve her. 
Seetha herself expresses her anguish about Rama&#39;s indulgence in a Supreme welfare-state, 
than in herself, as Mahaakavi Kalidasa, in his epical poem Raghu Vamsha, and depicts 
what this <font color="#B3003A">bhaagya lakshmi</font> has to say, when Rama, basing 
on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject, deserts Seetha in favour of
<font color="#B3003A">raajya lakshmi</font> when Seetha said as below:</font></p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
upasthitaam puurvam apaasya lakShmiim vanam mayaa saarthamasi prapannaH |<br>
tad aaspadam praapya tayaati roShaat soDhaa asmi na tad bhavane vasantii || raghuvamsha</p>

<p class="comment">
&quot;Earlier you refused the kingdom-wealth, <font color="#B3003A">raajya lakshmi</font> 
and came to forests, where I was with you. Now that, that kingdom-wealth,
<font color="#B3003A">raajya lakshmi</font> on winning your affection is jealous 
of me, who am your <font color="#B3003A">bhaagya lakshmi</font> &#39;fortune-wealth...&#39; 
and she does not let me live in your palace.&quot; And thus, Seetha departs Rama to forests, 
at the fag end of Ramayana.</font></p>

<p class="comment">
Valmiki declares Ramayana is <font color="#B3003A">siithaayaaH charitam mahaan...</font> 
&#39;Seetha&#39;s impeccable conduct...&#39; by giving her an unusual birth from the furrow 
of the plough, and in the end she exits from this world into the same soil, where 
the earth is called <font color="#B3003A">vasundhara</font>, which cleaves under 
Seetha&#39;s feet, and takes Seetha into her womb again. As such, the reason for Seetha 
to be there in that furrow as baby is said to be a vow of Goddess Lakshmi, in her 
earlier incarnation as Vedavati. The mythologies go on to say that Vedavati is the 
brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati in marriage 
none less than Vishnu. But in his lifetime, it is an unfulfilled desire. Then Vedavati 
starts a rigorous penance to achieve her father&#39;s wish. When she is at her culmination 
point of her penance, Ravana, passing that way in sky sees this beautiful lady, 
nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation, curses Ravana 
saying that she will reincarnate herself, to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. 
Then she causes a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. And Vedavati is reborn 
as Seetha of Ramayana, in an unusual way.</font></p>

Here <font color="#B3003A">aananda raamaayaNa</font> has an interesting parable. 
Once there was a king named Padmaaksha who wanted Lakshmi as his daughter. On practising 
ascesis Vishnu appears and gives a fruit called <font color="#B3003A">maatulunga 
phala</font>, and girl emerges from out of that fruit, and she is named as
<font color="#B3003A">Padma</font>. But greedy to possess her, all the wooing kings 
war with Padmaaksha and his entire family is ruined and Padma jumps into fire and 
self immolates herself. Later when Vishnu&#39;s <font color="#B3003A">maaya</font> comes 
out of an altar of fire, sits in her meditation, Ravana sees her and wants to abduct 
her. Of course, she is otherwise said to be Vedavati in other texts. But again, 
she enters the fire altar and reduces herself to ashes. Even then, Ravana searches 
in those ashes for her. In there, he gets five diamonds of high quality. He comes 
to Lanka and paces those diamonds in a casket and jovially presents them to his 
wife Mandodari. When Mandodari could not lift the casket Ravana lifts it and opens 
its lid, as he lifted Mt. Kailash. When the casket is opened, Mandodari finds a 
baby girl in it and recognises her to be Goddess Lakshmi. Then they consult their 
teachers about that baby&#39;s arrival. Those teaches wishing good for Ravana, advise 
to get rid off this girl immediately, for he is Goddess Lakshmi, arrived here only 
to end Ravana and his dynasty. Then Mandodari orders his servants to carry away 
this baby in a casket by an aircraft and get rid off it.</font></p>

But Ravana rushes after the girl with a sword, to put that girl to sword. Empress 
Mandodari pacifies Ravana and says &quot;Why purchase a later time death now itself at 
the hand of this baby... let that the casket be buried...&quot; Ravana agrees. Mandodari 
also curses this girl saying, <font color="#B3003A">&quot;this faithless girl, [for wealth 
is unfaithful,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses 
conquered, and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though 
wealthy and supreme by himself, will care nothing for the riches but view whole 
of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial attitude...&quot;</font> Thus 
this casket is buried in the fields of King Janaka&#39;s empire by demons, clandestinely. 
Mandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal 
world, to foster this buried girl, and thus presumed her curse to be twisty. But 
there is King Janaka with all the above attributes. A king without ego, wealthy 
but living simple, childless, yet does not crave for one, like King Dasharatha. 
Hence, he is called <font color="#B3003A">raajarSi</font> a saintly king. Seetha&#39;s 
birth is to be limitedly understood, as said by Janaka in this chapter. Otherwise, 
the nuances about the birth of Seetha are to be viewed through the viewfinders of 
mythologies, legends, and above all, through the viewfinders of tradition... but 
not in the vast of epical poetry, as Valmiki himself has undocumented it...</font></p>
