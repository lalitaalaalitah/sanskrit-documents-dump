			The legend of Trishanku is narrated to Rama, which forms a part of Vishvamitra&#39;s 
			legend. When Brahma blesses Vishvamitra to be a kingly-saint, rather 
			than a Brahman-saint, Vishvamitra continues his ascesis in southerly 
			parts of country. In the meantime, one king named Trishanku desired 
			to go to heaven with mortal body and approaches Vashishta who rejects 
			that very suggestion. Then that king approaches the sons of the same 
			Vashishta with the same idea.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Raghava, on making that great-souled Vashishta an enemy, whenever Vishvamitra 
reminisced over his subdual by Vashishta, he is seethed at heart and heaved sighs 
repeatedly. Then on going to southern quarter with his prime queen, that great-ascetic 
Vishvamitra self-collectedly conducted a highly astounding ascesis subsisting only 
on fruits and tubers.&quot; Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s 
legend. Then Vishvamitra begot sons named Havispanda, Madhuspnada, Dhridhanetra 
and Mahaaratha, who conduct themselves in candour and chivalry.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;At the close of one thousand years of ascesis Brahma, the Grandparent of all worlds, 
revealed Himself to Vishvamitra and spoke these words mellowly to ascetically wealthy 
Vishvamitra, &#39;oh, son of Kushika, Vishvamitra, you have won the worlds of kingly-sages 
by your ascesis.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;We indeed acquiesce you as a kingly-sage by your ascesis.&#39; saying so that great 
resplendent Brahma, the Supreme Ruler of the Worlds, went away to his Abode of Brahma, 
while the gods in Brahma&#39;s convoy went to Indra&#39;s Heaven.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On hearing that Vishvamitra is down-faced with disgrace, and while high anguish 
prevailed over him, he rancorously soliloquised this.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Even though I have practised a very high ascesis, the gods together with the 
observances of hermits are recognising me just as a &#39;kingly-sage.&#39; Thereby I deem 
that there is no fruition to my ascesis.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra thought. &quot;Oh, Rama of 
Kakutstha, deciding in this way in his heart of hearts that self-willed Vishvamitra 
again undertook a supreme ascesis as he is a great-ascetic.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;In this meantime there is a veracious king named Trishanku, an enhancer of Ikshvaku 
dynasty, and one renowned for his self-conquest. Oh, Raghava, an idea sprang up 
in the mind of Trishanku to perform a ritual by which he will go to heaven with 
his own body. Then he sincerely invited Vashishta and told him what his thinking 
is. But the great-souled Vashishta said it as impossible. Thus repudiated Trishanku 
went to southerly direction in search of orchestrators for the purpose of realising 
that task, such a phantasmal ritual that enables him to go to heaven with his body, 
and that king hjas gone to the sons of Vashishta.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Trishanku has indeed gone to the place where the sons of Vashishta are protractedly 
expiating, and there he visited the hundred noble-souled sons of Vashishta, who 
are supremely self-luminescent and superbly self-refulgent by their ascesis. On 
reaching nigh of those noble-souled sons of the indoctrinator, namely Vashishta, 
Trishanku reverenced all of them sequentially according to their age, but with a 
little down- faced owing to abashment, and spoke to all of those great-souled ones 
making palm-fold in supplication.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;I have come as a shelter-seeker seeking the shelter of yours as you are the shelterers 
of the needy, you all be safe, as the great-souled Vashishta has repudiated me. 
I am longing to perform an unusual ritual and it will be apt of you to give assent 
to it. Reverencing all of the sons of my mentor Vashishta I am proposing this to 
you. With reverence I truckle before you all Brahmans who are abiding in ascesis. 
Such as you are I beg you to assiduously get a ritual performed through me, as to 
how I can get to heaven with my body. Oh, ascetically wealthy Brahmans, as I am 
repudiated by Vashishta, I do not perceive another recourse excepting you, who are 
all the sons of mentor Vashishta.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;The Priest is the ultimate recourse for all of the kings in Ikshvaku dynasty, 
isn&#39;t it. Therefore, next to Vashishta you are all the next-best gods to me.&#39; Thus 
Trishanku entreated the hundred sons of Sage Vashishta.&quot; Sage Shataananda thus continued 
narration.
