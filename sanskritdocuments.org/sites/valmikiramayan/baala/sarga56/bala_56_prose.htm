<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties
 <br>Sarga 56 in Prose</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Vashishta nullifies Vishvamitra&#39;s missiles just by his Brahma&#39;s baton. 
			All missiles are defused when Vashishta consumed tghem. Vishvamitra 
			launches the highest missile, namely Brahma-missile, which too is consumed 
			by Vashishta, whereby the body of Vashishta becomes a Brahma missile 
			and starts to emit radiation. Then, upon the prayer of gods and saints, 
			Vashishta withdraws the effect of that missile. Vishvamitra on seeing 
			this concludes that mere missiles are of no use and thus he embarks 
			on a sublime ascesis for Brahma-hood.</p>

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When Vashishta spoke in this way, the great-mighty Vishvamitra brandishing Fiery-missile 
challenged Vashishta saying, &#39;withstand this, withstand this...&quot; Thus, sage Shataananda 
continued his narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;That reverential sage Vashishta then upraising his Brahma-baton, which is like 
the other baton of the Terminator, spoke this sentence furiously. &#39;I am staying 
here only, you meritless Kshatriya, you may clearly display whatever prowess you 
have, oh, Gaadhi&#39;s son Vishvamitra, I will now ruin whatever vanity you or your 
missiles have. Where stands the force of belligerence when compared to the supreme 
force of sagacity, you abased Kshatriya, watch out for my strength of seraphic sagacity.&#39; 
So said Vashishta to Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;With his baton of Brahma Vashishta silenced that matchless and deadly Fiery-missile 
of Gaadhi&#39;s son, namely Vishvamitra, as a deluge of water silencing a rage of fire. 
Vshvamitra, the son of Gaadhi then rancorously fusilladed the missiles regulated 
by gods like Varuna, Rudra, Indra, Paashupata, and even a missile which is projectile 
through grass blade called Ishiika.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The accounts of these missiles are narrated in chapters 27, 28 of this canto Bala, 
where Vishvamitra accords these very missiles to Rama. Hence, their details are 
not reiterated here but just catalogued.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Vishvamitra also launched missiles named Humane, Rager, Stupefier, Hypnotiser, 
Yawner, Intoxicator, also thus Humidifier, Weep-inducer. He also launched the missiles 
called Drainer and Ripper, and the highly unconquerable Thunderbolt, even the lassos 
of Brahma, Time and Rain-gods. Also missiles called Shiva, Monster, Punisher, Wrester 
and like that the Baffler, Bolter, Drier, Drencher are launched. And he launched 
discs called the Discs of Virtue, Time and Vishnu and he also launched other missiles 
like the Blower, Stirrer and like that the missile with Horse-head. A pair of powers 
are launched, namely Power of Vishnu and the Power of Rudra, like that the Impeller, 
Crowbar, and a great missile called Staggerer, and then he launched the lethal missile 
of the Time. Oh, Rama, the descendent of Raghu, Vishvamitra on triggering off all 
these missiles then he launched the deadly Trident, Skull and Torque missiles on 
Vashishta, and whole thing has became a spectacular display of Vishvamitra&#39;s arsenal.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Brahma&#39;s son Vashishta defused all of those missiles just with his baton and when 
all of them are thus silenced, Gaadhi&#39;s son Vishvamitra touched off Brahma&#39;s missile. 
When Vishvamitra brandished and set up Brahma missile for launching, seeing it all 
the gods keeping the Fire-god at their vanguard, godly sages, reptiles along with 
gandharva-s are perplexed, and the triad of worlds itself is perturbed. Even that 
deleteriously destructive Brahma&#39;s missile is completely consumed with the seraphic 
resplendence of Brahma-baton of Sage Vashishta.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;The appearance of that great-souled Vashishta became appallingly perplexing when 
he is finishing off that Brahma missile as if to surely petrify the Tri-world. From 
all of the pits of hair of that great-souled Vashishta ramified are the raditional 
beams and those radiated shafts are rolling up with the fumes of radiation, so to 
speak. The baton of Brahma gripped in his hand and upraised by Vashishta is highly 
glowing as if it is the fumeless inferno of Time, and as if it is the earthly baton 
of Yama, the Terminator.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;The assemblages of saints then extolled the best meditator Vashishta saying, &#39;oh, 
Brahman, infallible is your prowess, but bear this combustion of missile by your 
own combustive power. Though Vishvamitra is a supreme ascetic he is forestalled 
by you and your seraphic power, but this power of yours is equally anguishing all 
the worlds. Hence, let the worlds survive shooing away their anguish caused by your 
prowess. Oh, Brahman, be gracious, for you are the best among the best meditators...&#39; 
So said saints to Vashishta. When that great-resplendent Vashishta is spoken thus 
by saints and gods he composed himself, and then that estranged Vishvamitra spoke 
this to himself with heavy suspiration.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Fie upon the might of Kshatriya, mightier is the might of Brahman&#39;s resplendence, 
only with one baton of Brahma all of my missiles are defused.&nbsp; Therefore on 
analysing this matter, I with my heart and senses quietened will embark on a sublime 
ascesis which really will be the causative factor for according Brahma-Sage-hood.&#39; 
So thought Vishvamitra...&quot; Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s 
legend.

brahmatva - brahaman-hood
</p>

<p  class="comment">Firstly the difference between a
<font color="#B3003A">Brahmin</font> and a <font color="#B3003A">Brahman</font> 
may be differentiated, where a Brahmin is just by his birth in that caste and if 
he practises numerous ordeals he will attain Brahman-hood. Not all Brahmins are 
Brahmans and a real Brahman will not look back for his birth details.</p>

<p class="comment">Throughout 
this chapter Vashishta is called by Valmiki as <font color="#B3003A">japataam varaH, 
japataam shreSTaH</font> and the like, only to remind us that Vashishta is an eminent 
meditator of Vedic hymns, all of which culminate into Gayatri hymn. Thus, Vashishta&#39;s 
only weapon is Gayatri hymn with which he subjugated all the arsenal of Vishvamitra. 
The fight between Vishvamitra and Vashishta is not just a fight between a sage and 
king, but between <font color="#B3003A">vidya - avidya; aatma vidya - anaatma vidya</font> 
&#39;enlightenment and un-enlightenment...&#39; An enlightened one does not spring up at 
any trivial inconvenience but becomes a horrid being, if that antagonistic assail 
becomes intolerable for living beings. This is the real essence and nature of a 
true <font color="#B3003A">Brahman,</font> whose arsenal is just a wooden baton 
and heartfelt Gayatri hymn.</p>

<p class="comment">
For this Bhagavad Gita says at Ch. 18, verse 
42: </p>

<p class="ItrSloka">shamo damaH tapaH shaucamkShaantiH aarjavam eva ca |<br>

<p  class="comment">&#39;A Brahman&#39;s virtues, / Prince 
Born of his nature, are serenity / Self-mastery, religion, purity / Patience, uprightness, 
learning, and to know / The truth of things which be...&#39; Sir Edwin Arnold.</p>

<p  class="comment">Thus, 
Vashishta had never resorted to meaningless curses, menacing arsenal, mutinous retaliation 
but just swallowed the wrath of a wrathful king. This is <font color="#B3003A">brahmaNatva</font></p>
