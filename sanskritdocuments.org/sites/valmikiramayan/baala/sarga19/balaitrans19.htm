<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Sage Vishvamitra asks King Dasharatha to send Rama to protect the Vedic ritual that is being 
conducted by him, from the demons that are constantly disrupting it. The sage asserts King 
Dasharatha that he and the other sages in Dasharatha&#39;s court know the capabilities of Rama 
and though Rama is in his adolescence, he can easily kill the demons. But Dasharatha is upset 
at this request.</p>

<p class="comment">
These verses are commented extensively by early commentators. In 14th verse, the pronoun
<em>aham</em>, &#39;I&#39; used by Sage Vishvamitra is to announce definiteness about his own stature 
to know the Absolute vis-a-vis the Absolute Himself. Vishvamitra was an emperor who left off 
everything. He was primarily a <em>raaja R^ishi</em>, kingly sage, later became <em>brahma 
R^ishi</em> and performed <em>moksha kaameSTi</em>. That is a highest ascesis for achieving 
salvation. Whereas Dasharatha performed Vedic ritual called <em>putra kaameSTi</em>, ritual 
for begetting sons, as he is still involved in earthly passions. Thus he is still in karmic 
cycle and recently went under the veil of <em>moha</em>, worldly delusion, advent to the birth 
of sons. So Dasharatha cannot know who Rama is. All these aspects are said to qualify that 
expression <em>aham</em>, i.e., &#39;I am&#39;, as said by Vishvamitra.</p>

<p class="comment">
He also says <em>aham vedmi</em> , it is not just &#39;I know&#39; but &#39;I am in full knowledge of 
Rama&#39; and it is immediately followed by <em>mahaa aatmaanam</em> , about the sublime soul 
Rama. Rama is at present a twelve-year lad, and Dasharatha should have enquired how a boy 
is said to be a sublime-soul. Dasharatha did not bother to enquire about the high souled property 
of his son, because of his newfound fondness for sons. But, Vishvamitra is in full knowledge 
as to who Rama is, and says Rama is a sublime-soul, as contained in scripture <em>puruSa suukta</em> 
which says <em>veda aham etam puruSam mahaantam</em>, and as in <em>yo maam pashyatiMe na 
praNasyati</em> Bhagavad Gita, 6-30, as well.</p>

<p class="comment">
In next foot at 15th verse, Vishvamitra argues that he is not just extolling Rama to achieve 
his personal purpose, i.e., the completion of ritual. He says, <em>vashiSTHo api</em> even 
Sage Vashishta, knows Rama. Here the word <em>api</em> , even, is said to have been used to 
qualify Vashishta as an antagonist of Vishvamitra in policy differences. &#39;Even my opponent, 
this Sage Vashishta, the descendent of Goddess Saraswati and Brahma, and a <em>brahmarSi</em>, 
Absolute-knower, and at whose instance I became a <em>brahmarSi</em> from <em>aajarSi</em>, 
is aware of Rama...&#39; is the argument of Vishvamitra, stressing his neutrality in seeking Rama&#39;s 
help.</p>

<p class="comment">
Still Vishvamitra tells that <em>ye cha ime tapaH sthitaa</em> , &#39;those sages that are here 
who are rooted in ascesis&#39; as in the vein of <em>puruSa suukta</em> which says <em>tasya dhiiraaH 
pratijaananti yonim</em>. Vishvamitra&#39;s argument is &#39;Sage Vashishta may take sides with you, 
because he is <em>raja guru</em> , the royal priest, while the others like Kaashyapa, Vaamadeva 
will tell you clearly, as they have no leaning on your court.&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
All said and done, King Dasharatha is still lingering for a reply. Seeing that Vishvamitra 
further says, &#39;if you want to achieve renown, send Rama.&#39; No father rejoices that much when 
a son is birthed than on his achieving reputation. Dasharatha is advised in the same way when 
saying <em>yadi dharmamlaabham, yasha laabham</em> &#39;if you want renown through a worthy son, 
who will be renowned in all three worlds by his coming with me, then you send Rama...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Now Rama&#39;s reputation is going to be enhanced by Sage Vishvamitra in eliminating demoness 
Tataka, in releasing Ahalya from her curse, breaking Shiva&#39;s bow, marriage with Seetha, rebuffing 
Parashuraama etc. And also Vishvamitra leaves the decision to Dasharatha, &#39;if only your ministers, 
clergy as well political, permit then alone you send Rama with me...&#39;</p>
