<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Bhageeratha&#39;s effort for bringing Ganga to earth is fulfilled. Amshuman and his 
son Dileepa could not make any effort to bring the divine river to earth. But Bhageeratha, 
the son of Dileepa, staunch at heart tries earnestly to get her onto earth. Brahma 
agreeing for this descent of Ganga designates lord Shiva to bear the burden of the 
onrush of Ganga, because the earth cannot sustain it.</p>
