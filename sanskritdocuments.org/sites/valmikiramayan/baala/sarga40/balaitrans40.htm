<h3>Introduction</h3>



          <p class="txt">
 Sage Vishwamitra's narration of Sagara's legend is continued. Sagara's
          sons dig out all the quarters of earth and when they enter northeast to find out the
          horse thief, there they find Sage Kapila, i.e., Vishnu in the semblance of a sage. When
          they wanted to attack that sage Kapila, he renders them to heaps of ashes by his yogic
          powers.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 This is the cosmic routine. Every day of Brahma is one <em>
 kalpa</em>
  and in
  each <em>kalpa</em> Brahma starts to create the universe afresh. Though it is just like the
  bygone creation it is anew, but the presiding souls of each object of the universe will change.
  If one soul presides the Sun or the Moon in this era, in the next era they attain a higher step
  in the ladder of 'snakes and ladders' called <em>vaikunTha paali</em> and a soul-in-wait takes up
  the job of that Sun or Moon, just as good as the promotions of officials. In this cosmic
  destruction even the gods or godlike entities will be destroyed if they tend to cause unnecessary
  ruination to the living beings <em>anena bahu praNi
  upadrava kaariNaam devaa api vadha upaayam abhiipsanti - daiva hataanaam ca teShaam avicaareNa
  naaso bhavatya eveti suucitam -dk</em> This is the same even in the case of Indra.
  Vishnu in His Trivikrama incarnation blesses the demonic Emperor Bali with such Indra-hood in
  some era, when Bali's sin is counted down, and when merit accrues.</p>
