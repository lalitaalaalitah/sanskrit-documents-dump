<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties<br>Sarga 64 in Prose </h3>

			<p class="txt">Vishvamitra curses Rambha, the celestial wench, knowing that she 
			arrived at the behest of Indra to cause hindrance to his ascesis. 
			But later feels ashamed to loose his tongue and then he is 
			determined to undertake another round of ascesis to conquer is own 
			senses.</p>


<p class="verloc">

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, Rambha, now you have to undertake this very great task of gods in 
enchanting Vishvamitra with a craving caused by lust, for lusting after you.&#39; 
Thus Indra ordered Rambha...&quot; Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of 
Vishvamitra to Rama.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, when that celestial wench is spoken thus by the Thousand-eyed Indra, 
she diffidently said to that chief of gods while adjoining her palms 
suppliantly.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, chief of gods, Indra, that great saint Vishvamitra is a dangerous one and 
undoubtedly he releases his deadly anger on me. Oh, god, thereby I am fearful of 
him. Hence, oh, god, it will be apt of you to accord forbearance.&#39; So said 
Rambha to Indra. Oh, Rama, the Thousand-eyed Indra replied Rambha when she spoke 
to him in that way while shuddering in fear and making palm fold in 
supplication. &#39;You need not be fearful, Rambha, carry out my command, safe 
betides you, I on becoming a heart-stealing black-songbird will be at your side 
along with Love-god in the pleasing trees of springtime. Indeed on your assuming 
a highly sparkling semblance, and multi-multiplexing your savoir faire, with bon 
viveurs and bon vivants, you disengage that ascetical sage Kaushika from his 
ascesis.&#39; So said Indra to Rambha.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On hearing the sentence of Indra she adopted an unexcelled physique, and on 
becoming a pulchritudinous damsel she started to entice Vishvamitra with giggly 
grins.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Vishvamitra has heard melodious trilling tune of songbird, and while his heart 
is highly gladdening about the ambience, he incidentally saw and stared at 
Rambha. By the exceptional trilling tune of that songbird and by the 
unexceptional tableau of Rambha the sage is on his qui vive. On knowing that as 
an escapade of the Thousand-eyed Indra, Vishvamitra is enwrapped in wrath and he 
cursed Rambha.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Whereof you tried to entice me who am wishing to win over the wanton and 
wroth, you unlucky female Rambha, thereof you will become a rocklike statued 
wastrel. A highly resplendent Brahman who is ascetically powerful redeems you, 
oh, Rambha, who are now blemished by my anger.&#39; Vishvamitra cursed Rambha in 
this way.
</p>

<p class="comment">
This ascetically powerful Brahman-saviour of Rambha is none other than the Sage 
Vashishta, the brainchild of Brahma. Even though Vishvamitra is at loggerheads 
with Vashishta, he holds Vashishta in high respect.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Thus the great-resplendent Vishvamitra became compunctious when that 
great-saint could not contain his anger in uttering an angry curse.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 Angering for trivial reasons, or on trivially inferiors ones is a
  demeritorious triviality in loosing ascetic power. Irrestrainable temperament will not only ruin
  the ascetic powers but also breeds a prolonged compunction. Manu defines<em> jita indriya</em> as
  one who <em>shrutvaa
  spR^iShTvaa ca dR^iShTvaa ca bhaktvaa ghraatvaa ca yau naraH | na hR^iShyati glaayati vaa sa
  vij~neyo jitendriyaH || - manu</em>'he who on hearing, touching, seeing, eating,
  smelling, but neither gladdens nor saddens, is a self-senses-conquered one...' The same is said
  in Bhagavad Gita, and the whole of <em>karma yoga</em> deals with the same subject, and it is
  said there: <em>tasmaat tvam
  indriyaaNi aadau niyamya bharatarShabha paapmaanam prajahi hi enam j~naana vij~naana naashanam ||
  giita 3-41</em></p>
    <p class="comment">
 He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt, / Disparting
  self from service, soul from works, / Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince! / Works fetter him
  no more! Cut then atwain / With sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata! - Sir Edwin Arnold.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then Rambha has become a rocklike statue by that great curse of Vishvamitra, 
and having heard the words of that great-saint Love-god and Indra also took 
flight. Owing to his angering that great-resplendent Vishvamitra is now divested 
of his ascetical merit, and he has no peace of mind owing to ungovernable 
senses. His conscience became sentimental owing to the divesture of his 
ascetical merit, and he soliloquised, &#39;I shall not succumb to wrath in anyway, 
nor I put my presentiment into words. Otherwise, I do not even respire for a 
hundred years for the respiratory gestures will also exhibit moods, and I indeed 
emaciate myself until I become a real conqueror of my own senses.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Till such time as I acquire Brahman-hood with the merit of my own ascesis I 
will be breathless and foodless, even if it is going to take endless years, and 
while I am in ascesis my bodily organs indeed will not undergo any 
deterioration.&#39; So said Vishvamitra to himself.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Thus that eminent sage abided by the commitment to the vow for a thousand 
years, oh, Rama, the legatee of Ragu, which is a nonpareil vow in the world.&quot; 
Thus Shataananda continued.
</p>
