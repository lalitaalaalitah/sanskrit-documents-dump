<h3><b>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties
<br>Sarga 50 in Prose</b></h3>
</center>

<p class="txt">
Rama arrives at Mithila along with Lakshmana led on by Vishvamitra. On hearing that 
Vishvamitra has arrived at their city Mithila, King Janaka proceeds to him welcomingly. 
On seeing Rama and Lakshmana near at Vishvamitra, Janaka inquisitively asks Vishvamitra 
about these two princes. Vishvamitra announces them as the sons of Dasharatha and 
informs about the adventurous deeds the boys have undertaken.</p>

&nbsp;
<p class="verloc">.----</p>
<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama then travelled along with Lakshmana towards northeast direction keeping 
Vishvamitra afore and neared the hall of Vedic ritual of Janaka in Mithila 
kingdom. </p>

<p class="comment">
The northeast is an auspicious direction, and even today it is held high for any 
ritual or in the architecture. This direction is presided over by <em>iishaana</em> 
The God.</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama who is with Lakshmana spoke to the tigerly saint Vishvamitra, &quot; the 
Vedic-ritual of noble-souled Janaka is excellent, indeed with bountifully 
garnered paraphernalia of the ritual. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, highly fortunate sage, this place abounds with many thousands of Brahmans 
who are experts in Vedic practises and who seem to be the dwellers of numerous 
provinces, and also discernable are the cottages of sages rife with hundreds of 
carts full with their ceremonial chattels, as such oh, Brahman, a campsite may 
be decided for us too, as I discern every inch is inhabited.&quot; Thus Rama spoke to 
Vishvamitra. </p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing the words of Rama that great-saint Vishvamitra arranged a camp at an 
unfrequented place that has refreshing water. </p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing that Vishvamitra has arrived in Mithila, then the best king Janaka 
instantly forged ahead towards Vishvamitra, keeping his unreprovable priest 
Shataananda afore of the team, in deference to Vishvamitra. </p>

<p class="tat">
Even the Ritvik-s, the administrators of that Vedic-ritual, of the great souled 
king Janaka arrived with post-haste taking holy waters, and they have 
ritualistically offered that sanctified water to Vishvamitra.</p>

<p class="tat">
On receiving that veneration from the great souled Janaka, Vishvamitra asked 
after the well-being of the king Janaka, as well about the unhindered 
proceedings of that Vedic-ritual.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then Vishvamitra asked after the well-being of saints, mentors, clerics, as 
befitting to their order, and joined the company of all of the sages as a 
happy-souled sage. </p>

<p class="tat">
The king Janaka adjoining his palms then spoke to that eminent-sage Vishvamitra, 
&quot;oh, reverend sage, please be seated on this high seat, along with these eminent 
saints in their respective seats.&quot; Thus Janaka spoke to Vishvamitra [-0-0b, a]</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing the words of Janaka that great-sage Vishvamitra took his seat, and 
king Janaka also took seat along with his royal priest Shataananda, and the 
administrators of that Vedic-ritual, namely Ritvik-s, and along with his 
ministers. </p>

<p class="tat">
On beholding all of them seated all about in their respective seats as demanded 
by procedure king Janaka then spoke to Vishvamitra. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Today my Vedic ritual is enriched with your advent, whereby I deem that gods 
have fructified the ritual. Let the ritual be like that. I deem that I have 
obtained the fruit of the ritual just on seeing godlike you here today. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Brahman, at which Vedic-ritual hall you have arrived along with so many 
sages that happens to be mine, whereby, oh, eminent saint, I feel that I am 
honoured and hallowed.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Brahma-sage, the scholarly Ritvik-s conducting my Vedic-ritual are saying 
that only twelve more days are remaining to complete the observation of 
ritual-pledge, and then oh, Kaushika, it will be apt of you to see the gods who 
arrive at the conclusion of this Vedic-ritual expecting their due in the 
ritual.&quot; So said king Janaka to Vishvamitra. </p>

<p class="tat">
On speaking to that tigerly sage Vishvamitra in this way, the king again asked 
the sage pointedly and inquisitively with adjoined palms and with a gladdened 
face.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious elephants and 
arrogant lions, bearing a similitude to adventurous tigers and adamantine bulls, and wielding 
quivers, swords, and bows, are valorous with their valour matching that of Vishnu, and with their 
eyes broad like lotus-petals and with youthfulness in the offing they look like the exceptionally 
beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced 
here as though immortals have chanced on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for 
they have come here, and whose scions are they? </p>

<p class="comment">
These foots are the same as king Sumati&#39;s dialogue at 1-48-2, 3, 4 including <em>anvaya</em> , parsing.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, great-saint, whose sons are these two valiant youngsters who are 
brandishing best weapons? They are embellishing this province as the Sun and 
Moon doeth the sky. Each to each they are clonal by postural-language, by 
facial-language and by body language. They appear valorous but boyish in their 
appearance, as their curls are still jet-black like crow-wings. Thus, whether 
they are immature by age though mature by their valour or so, I wish to listen 
about them in actuality. </p>

<p class="comment">
Import of verses is the same as at 1-48-5, 6, with a little difference in <em>anvaya</em> , parsing.</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing the words of great-souled Janaka, Vishvamitra whose anima is 
immeasurable, has announced that those two as the sons of king Dasharatha. </p>

<p class="tat">
The highly resplendent great-saint Vishvamitra has informed the high souled 
Janaka about the coming of Rama and Lakshmana to the Hermitage of 
Accomplishment, their stopping over there and elimination of demons at that 
place, their indefatigable travel along with him, beholding City of Vishaala, 
seeing Ahalya, her reuniting with Sage Gautama, likewise their coming hitherward 
to gain a grasp of great bow of Shiva. On informing all these incidents to 
Janaka as well as to Shataananda, who incidentally is the son of Ahalya, sage 
Vishvamitra paused.</p>
