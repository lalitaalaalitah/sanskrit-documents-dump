<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties<br>Sarga 12 in Prose </h3>

<p class="tat">

  King Dasharatha requests the Sages to conduct the Vedic ritual for which the 
  sages indent paraphernalia, which the ministers are ordered to supply 
  forthwith. This chapter is almost a replication of chapter 8, excepting the 
  inclusion of references to Sage Rishyasringa who by now is available in 
  Ayodhya.</p>

<p class="tat">

  After a lapse some time when spring season has come the king Dasharatha 
  desired to perform the Vedic ritual. </p>

<p class="comment">

  Please refer to endnote for Indian seasons and months for vasanta / spring 
  season.</p>

<p class="tat">

  Then bowing his head before that Brahmana sage Rishyasringa whose is glow is 
  like that of a deity, King Dasharatha verily beseeched that sage to conduct 
  Vedic ritual on his behalf as he wished to beget progeny to maintaining his 
  family line. Sage Rishyasringa who by now is well-honoured by the king said to 
  the king, &quot;So it shall be, let the paraphernalia for ritual be garnered and 
  let your ritual horse be released as a prerogative.&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">

  Then King Dasharatha said to his best minister Sumantra, &quot;Let the Vedic 
  scholars and ritual conductors like Sages Suyajna, Vaamadeva, Jaabaali, and 
  Kaashyapa, along with the family priest Vashishta, as well as other Vedic 
  Brahmans that are there, they all be invited swiftly...&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">

  Then Sumantra being a quickest person went quickly and fetched all those Vedic 
  scholars and clergymen. Then the virtuous king Dasharatha having offered due 
  worships to all the sages and saints brought in by Sumantra, uttered these 
  words which are with virtue and meaning, in an impressible manner. </p>

<p class="tat">

  &quot;My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... hence I am 
  thinking of performing the Vedic Horse Ritual for progeny... I wish to perform 
  the ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and by strict observances... I wish 
  to get my desires fulfilled through the divine influence of the Sage's son, 
  Rishyasringa... </p>

<p class="tat">

  Then &quot;Splendid, splendid is this idea,&quot; said the Brahmana scholars blessing 
  the king. Then Sage Vashishta along with all other important personalities 
  have applauded the idea that has come out of the king's voice, and all those 
  Vedic scholars and clergymen keeping Rishyasringa at helm of affairs said this 
  to the king, in appreciation of that idea. </p>

<p class="tat">

  &quot;Because a virtuous thinking of begetting sons through Vedic ritual has come 
  to you, you will by all means get four sons with boundless valour... let 
  ritual paraphernalia be garnered and let your ritual-horse be released...&quot; The 
  Vedic seers thus blessed Dasharatha. </p>

<p class="tat">

  Then the king is gladdened to hear the blessing advises of the Vedic scholars, 
  and he spoke to the other ministers of his court, with happiness derived from 
  those good words.</p>

<p class="tat">

  The king said to his executives, &quot;As advised by my Vedic teachers, let the 
  paraphernalia for my ritual be procured... let the ritual-horse be released, 
  guarded well by gallant men in its journey... and let religious teachers 
  follow that horse as per tradition... let the ritual place be decided on the 
  northern banks of Sarayu River... let the peace invocations be prevailing and 
  prospering throughout as ordained in the scriptures and tradition... all the 
  kings on this earth would have performed this Horse Ritual, if only they can 
  perform this without a mistake... thus, this is a great and difficult 
  ritual... the Brahma-demons will be hunting for the faults performed in the 
  rituals whereat they can inteject themselves in to the proceedings of the 
  ritual in order to ruin it... further, the performer of the ritual also gets 
  ruined if there were be to be faults... that is why this ritual shall be 
  conducted faultlessly till its conclusion, and with absolute adherence to the 
  scriptures... since all of you assembled here are efficient ones in conducting 
  such rituals without faults, I hope you all will organise carefully.... </p>

<p class="tat">

  In appreciation of his orders all the ministers replied the king saying &quot;it 
  will be done accordingly...&quot; and indeed they have faultlessly carried out 
  works as ordered. Then all the Brahmans applauded the virtuous king and who is 
  like a Sacred Bull among the kings for his virtuous endeavour of undertaking 
  the Vedic ritual, and with his permission all of them returned from there as 
  they have come. </p>

<p class="tat">

  On the departure of the prominent Brahmans, King Dasharatha sent off those 
  ministers who are still available there for further orders from the king, and 
  then he the great resplendent king has entered his own palace. </p>

  Indian seasons</p>

<p class="tat">

  The Indian yearly time-cycle is two-kind, one on northern solstice and the 
  other southern solstice. And seasons are twelve and every two months is a 
  season, and they are calculated by almanacs basing on the stars position every 
  year. They roughly compare with the following Gregorian months as below: </p>
