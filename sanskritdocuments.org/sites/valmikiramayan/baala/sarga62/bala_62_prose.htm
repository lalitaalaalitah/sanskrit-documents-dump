<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties<br>&nbsp;Sarga 62 in Prose</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Sage Vishvamitra curses his sons as they defy his orders and accords 
			two esoteric hymns to Shunashepa, for chanting them in the Vedic-ritual 
			of Ambariisha. Shunashepa gets longevity on chanting those hymns. Thus 
			Vishvamitra not only creates another universe as in Trishanku&#39;s episode, 
			he even accords longevity, or even deathlessness to mortals by his ascetic 
			power. Such as he is, he is the mentor of Rama, and hence Sage Shataananda 
			informs Rama about the capabilities of his own mentor, Vishvamitra, 
			in these many episodes.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, the best one among men and the legatee of Raghu, on taking Shunashepa 
that highly renowned king Ambariisha took rest at noontime on the lakeside of Holy 
Lake.&quot; Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Shunashepa, as a part of Vishvamitra&#39;s 
legend.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;While the king Ambariisha is taking rest that highly brilliant Shunashepa came 
to the lakeside of main Holy Lake with high anxiety, and there he indeed saw his 
maternal uncle Sage Vishvamitra who is performing ascesis along with other sages. 
Shunashepa became pitiable and sulky faced by strain and thirst, oh, Rama, and he 
immediately fell in the lap of saint Vishvamitra saying this sentence.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;I have no mother or a father to save me. Then wherefore cousins or relatives 
will be there to protect me. Oh, peaceable saint the eminent, it will be apt of 
you to protect me according to saintliness. Oh, illustrious sage, you alone are 
the saviour to each and every one, isn&#39;t it! You alone are the guardian angel, isn&#39;t 
it! Hence, let the purpose of the king Ambariisha be achieved, and let longevity 
come to me, and I on becoming imperishable and indeed on performing an unexcelled 
ascesis, I wish to enjoy in heavenly worlds.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; You shall be my providence with a providential sentiment as I stand unprotected, 
and oh, virtue souled one, it will be apt of you to protect me from misfortune, 
like a father protecting his own son.&#39; Thus Shunashepa appealed to Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On hearing that sentence of Shunashepa and on pacifying him in many ways, Vishvamitra 
of higher ascesis, indeed said this to his sons. For what reason parents engender 
sons, desiring positivity and for the purpose of welfare in the other worlds, this 
is the time that has come for fulfilling that reason.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Vividly: &#39;A father&#39;s ambition in begetting sons is to do something good and positive 
to the society in the present world and when departed a right place is acquired 
in heavens through these sons, by their yearly death-day rituals etc., and hence 
you do some good in saving this boy from premature death and earn an apt place for 
me in heavens...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;This youngster is the son of sage and he aspires shelter from me. Hence, oh, 
sons, give him satisfaction just by giving life to him. You all have done very good 
pious deeds and you all abide by probity. Hence, you bestow appeasement to Fire-god 
on your becoming the ritual-animals of king Ambariisha in lieu of this boy Shunashepa. 
As a result, Shunashepa will have protectors, Vedic-ritual will be unimpeded, gods 
will be oblated, and my word too will be actualised.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra said to his 
sons.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;But on hearing the saying of the sage, oh, Rama, the best of men, Madhushyanda 
and the other sons of Vishvamitra said this, haughtily and disparagingly.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;On sacrificing your own sons how can you save another&#39;s son, oh, lordly father, 
we deem this as a wrongdoing and as good as dog&#39;s meat in a dinner.&#39; Thus the sons 
of Vishvamitra replied their father.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Vishvamitra will be nagged by almost all, including his sons, on this &#39;dog-meat-eating.&#39; 
There is a parable in Maha Bharata that Vishvamitra once tried to eat dog&#39;s meat 
when he did not get any food, but caught red-handedly. Later this has become the 
curse-theme to Vishvamitra when he cursed Vashishta&#39;s sons. At the present juncture 
also he curses his own sons with the same theme.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On listening that saying of his sons that eminent sage Vishvamitra started to curse 
them while fury reddened his eyes. You all have not only transgressed my word, but 
pertly replied me in an impudent manner which is abhorrent and hair-raising, and 
recriminatory according to probity. You all will be whirling around the earth totally 
for a thousand years taking birth in the race that subsists on dog&#39;s meat, like 
the sons of Vashishta.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra cursed his sons.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On making his sons bounden by curse, then that best saint spoke to the pitiable 
Shunashepa, on making unharmed invulnerability to him with sanctifying hymns.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;When you are fastened with sacred fastener to the sacrificial post of Vishnu, 
smeared with red paste and garlanded with red garlands, you praisefully address 
the Fire-god with the words I going to impart to you in Vedic hymns. These two divine 
hymns, oh, son of saint, shall be chanted in the Vedic-ritual of Ambariisha, then 
you will obtain your aspiration.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra taught two Vedic hymns to the 
boy. Shunashepa having taken those two hymns from Vishvamitra very attentively has 
instantly gone to that lion-king Ambariisha and indeed spoke to him.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, king the lion, let us go promptly to your ritual place, oh, best king, you 
may apply yourself to your pledge in completing the ritual, with me as its sacrificial 
animal,&#39; thus the boy said. On listening that sentence of the son of sage, the king 
Ambariisha is gladdened and proceeded to the ritual hall immediately and spiritedly. 
The king with the permission of officiators of ritual got the boy prepared as a 
ritual animal with sanctified bodily features and clad him in red clothes and got 
him securely fastened to the sacrificial post.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When Shunashepa is tied to ritual post he immensely pleased two gods, namely Indra 
and Upendra as well, with those two hymns he got from Vishvamitra. Then the Thousand-eyed 
Indra who is satisfied with esoteric laudation is gladdened, and oh, Raghava, then 
he bestowed longevity to Shunashepa.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, the best one among men, he that king Ambariisha also obtained the fruits 
of that Vedic-ritual in manyfold, resulted from the grace of Thousand-eyed Indra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, the best among men, even the virtue-souled great ascetic Vishvamitra 
again performed ascesis at the same Holy lakeside for another thousand years.&quot; Thus 
Sage Shataananda continued the narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend.
