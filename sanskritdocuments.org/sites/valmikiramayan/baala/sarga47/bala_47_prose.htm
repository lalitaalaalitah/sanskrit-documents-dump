<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties
<br>Sarga 47 in Prose</h3>


<p class="txt">
The legend of Seven-Maruts, the Seven-Wind gods, and the legend of the kings of 
Vishaala are narrated to Rama and Lakshmana, while Vishvamitra is narrating the 
legend of Vishaala. At the request of Diti, Indra blesses the seven segments of 
her foetus to become <strong>sapta marut gaNa-s</strong> Seven Wind gods, and the 
place where the legend of Indra-Diti has happened, that province later became the 
City of Vishaala.</p>

<p class="verloc">
.</p>

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Diti was highly anguished when her foetus is rendered into sevenfold, and spoke 
these words to the indomitable Thousand-eyed Indra, in appeasement....&quot; Thus Vishvamitra 
continued his narration about City Vishala.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, Ruler of Gods, Indra, by my misdeed alone this foetus of mine is sliced into 
seven segments... and therein, in your slicing the foetus, oh, Indra, the eliminator 
of Bala, the demon, really no iniquity of yours is there...&#39; Thus Diti started speaking 
to Indra.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;though a reversal has happened against my thinking, in the matter of my foetus, 
let these seven segments become your Maaruta-s, the rulers of seven Ethereal-places, 
under your ruler-ship...
</p>

<p class="comment">
According to mythology there are seven ethereal places in cosmos on which the galaxies 
and planets are dependent. According to Vishnu Puraana: <em>aavaha pravahava caiva 
samvahaH ca udvaH ca tathaa | vihaa aakhyaH praivaahaH paraavaha iti kramaat || 
gaganaH sparshanaH vaayu anilaH ca tathaa aparaH | praaNaH praaNeshvaraH jiiva iti 
ete sapta maarutaaH ||</em> They are: <em>aavaha</em> the air called by this name 
will be pervading in clouds, thunderbolts, rain, meteors; <em>pravaha</em> air in 
solar orbit; <em>samhava</em> in lunar orbit; <em>udvaha</em> in galaxies; <em>vivaha</em> 
in planetary spheres; <em>parivaha</em> in the Seven-Sages sphere; <em>varaavaha</em> 
in north polar regions. These are otherwise called by names <em>gagana, sparshana, 
vaayu, anila, praaNa, praaNeshvara, jiiva</em>. Each of the Marut god has a batch 
of seven Marut-s, thus they are forty-nine entities, in total.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, son Indra, let these seven become the presiding deities of Cosmic Airy Divisions 
and let my sons move in heaven with heavenly forms... One from the seven may move 
in Brahma&#39;s abode, like that another in the heaven of Indra, and even the third 
one, let him become a greatly celebrated one and be reputed as Divine Wind, and 
he may circulate in entire Universe...Oh, Chief of Gods, Indra, indeed, let four 
of my sons truly permeate in four directions in time, let safety betide you, verily 
at your command...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Verily by the name given by you as &#39;Marut&#39; when you were saying &#39;maa ruda, maa 
ruda, &#39;do not cry, do not cry...&#39; they shall be renowned...&#39; Thus Diti said to Indra.</p>

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;&quot;On hearing her words, the Thousand-eyed one and the destroyer of enemy&#39;s 
citadels and a demon named Bala, namely Indra, spoke this word to Diti, humbly enfolding 
his palms.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;All this will happen as you said, undoubtedly, and they, the Maaruta-s would 
be pervading in the forms of gods, for they are your offspring...&#39; Thus Indra assured 
Diti.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Thus, they two, the stepmother Diti and the stepson Indra, on arriving at a decision 
in that ascetic forest, they departed to heaven fulfilling their purposes... thus 
we heard the legend...&quot; Vishvamitra continued his narration.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama of Kakutstha, this province is that province wherein Indra once presided 
over, where he rendered services to Diti, an accomplished one in her asceticism...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;To King Ikshvaku of Vishaala, oh, Tigerly-man Rama, a highly righteous son was 
born through Queen Alambusa and he was renowned as Vishaala, and also there is a 
city in this place, constructed by him and known by his own name, Vishaala...
</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: These Ikshvaku-s of Vishaala are not the Ikshvaku-s of Ayodhya, i.e., of 
Solar Dynasty. About this dynasty of Ikshvaku-s of Vishaala Bhaagavata Puraana says 
in its Seventh canto</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, Vishaala&#39;s son is the great-mighty Hemachandra, and from Hemachandra, 
a son who is highly renowned as Suchandra emerged in succession... Oh, Rama, the 
son of Suchandra became famous as Dhuumraashva, and even Dhuumraashva also derived 
his son, Srinjaya... The fortunate and valorous son of Srinjaya is Sahadeva, and 
the son of Sahadeva is Kushaashva, a highly noble one... The dauntless Somadatta 
is the son of Kushaashva and Somadatta&#39;s son is the verily reputed Kakutstha...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Ikshvaku&#39;s son, Kakutstha is a great-resplendent one, an unconquerable one, and 
a highly celebrated one, Sumati by name, now inhibits in this city...
</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: These two Ikshvaku and Kakutstha are of Vishaala dynasty not to be confounded 
with the grandparents of Rama.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;But, by the magnificence of Ikshvaku, the successive kings of Vishaala have longevity, 
intrepidity, well-off in generosity...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Now, we gladly go to sleep here for a night, and, oh, best one among men, tomorrow 
morning we shall be able to see Janaka, the King of Mithila...&quot; Thus Sage Vishvamitra 
spoke to Rama and Lakshmana.</p>

<p class="tat">
But that best one among best men, a widely reputed and an outshining King of Vishaala, 
Sumati, came to the fore of Vishvamitra, on hearing the arrival of Vishvamitra for 
a warm welcome... and on revering an utmost veneration, along with his mentors and 
family members, humbly adjoining his palms at Vishvamitra in supplication, King 
Sumati and on enquiring about the well-being of the Sage Vishvamitra, and then spoke...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;I am fortunate and much obliged in whose province chanced is your visualisation, 
also thus there is no better fortunate one than me...&quot; So said King Sumati to Vishvamitra.</p>
