<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties
<br>Sarga 26 in Prose </h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Rama encounters his first problem-female demoness Tataka, also called as Taadaka, and 
			eliminates her at the orders of sage Vishvamitra. This is a crucial test put to Rama by 
			Vishvamitra in ascertaining whether Rama is the follower of dharma through elder men&#39;s 
			orders or not. Rama eradicates Tataka basing on his own self-confidence.</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing the words of that unfaltering sage about demoness Tataka, Raghava, best man&#39;s son who is 
firm in his vows, reverently adjoining his palms replied the sage.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Upon my father&#39;s order, upon my honour to my father&#39;s word, and looking upon this as the word of 
sage Kushi&#39;s son, my mentor, this task is definitely to be implemented.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The third consideration is &#39;teacher&#39;s words&#39; <em>itarairapi guru shaasane sati avishankayaa 
dharmyam api tad uktam avashyam kartavyam iti suucitam - dharmaakuutam</em> hence, 
Rama cannot be heedless of the words of both his father and teacher.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;What my great souled father Dasharatha directed me to do among elders in Ayodhya, that word too 
cannot be disregarded.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Dasharatha bade Rama to do whatever assigned by Vishvamitra. Here Vishvamitra is 
assigning something ambiguous. Hence the dilemma between two instructions of two 
elderly people, and thus scriptures and practise confuse the young.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Such as I am, I will undertake the primary duty of eliminating Tataka, according as the follower of 
father&#39;s words, and according to the instruction of a Brahma scholar, such as your are, without a 
doubt.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Here Rama is in the same predicament as Arjuna in Maha Bharata. Arjuna&#39;s dilemma 
is to kill his own relatives, where Rama&#39;s is to kill a female at this juncture. 
What Krishna preaches in entire Bhagavad Gita is told in nutshell by sage Vishvamitra, 
i.e., &#39;do your duty as a Kshatriya, the ruling class, and protect virtue and eradicate 
vice, whether it is in the form of females or relatives.&#39; <em>atha vishvaamitro 
guruH - tasya vacanam avicaareNa kartavyam - evam sati dasharathena api - kasushiko 
yad vadati tat kartavyam - iti anushiSTo raamaH ekasya guror vacanam anullanghaniiyam 
- guru dvaya anushiSTam vacaH katham parihartum shakyata iti - strii vadha niSedhe 
satya api taaDakaa vadham angiikR^itavaan - dharmaakuutam</em>

</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;I am ready to effectuate the bidding of an inestimable sage like you, for the welfare of cows and 
Brahmans, and for the advantage of this province.&quot; So said Rama to sage Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Saying thus, Rama, the enemy-destroyer, clenched his left fist on the handgrip in the middle of the 
bow, and with the right he made a thunderous sound of the bowstring making all the directions to 
blast. By that sound the inhabitants of Tataka forest are startled, and even Tataka is stupefied by 
that sound, and she is intolerably infuriated at it. She who is convulsed in anger to hear that 
sound gave attention to the direction wherefrom it emerged and she rancorously rushed thereto.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Raghava on seeing that monstrous-looking demoness with a distorted face and who by proportions is 
very gigantic, furthermore infuriated, spoke to Lakshmana.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Lakshmana, see that yakshii&#39;s grisly and ghastly physique, seeing which hearts of cowards are prone 
to burst. She is unstoppable and has magical powers, is&#39;t, you may see now how I will make her to 
readily retreat by lopping off her ears and the tip of nose. As it is her feminineness is protecting 
her, and I too I do not really attempt to kill her, but I intend to terminate her impudence and 
mobility.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">
While Rama is still speaking that way, convulsed in anger Tataka roaringly rushed towards Rama 
alone, swinging her arms. But the Brahma-sage Vishvamitra daunted sounded her off dauntingly, and said to Rama 
and Lakshmana, &quot;let you be safe, and be victorious.&quot; Flinging up dreadful dust on those two 
Raghavaa-s, Tataka baffled them for a while with a massive cloud of dust. Then taking hold of 
witchery she inundated both the Raghava-s with highly torrential stone rain, by which Rama became 
indignant. On forestalling her effusive stone storming with his arrow storm, Rama even mutilated 
both of her arms with arrows while she rushed towards them.
</p>

<p class="tat">
With her arms severed and fatigued she started to roar extremely at the nearby, and then provoked 
Lakshmana made her to loose her ears and the tip of nose by cutting them off. That guise changer 
vanished after variously altering her aspects, and then on baffling them with her illusoriness and 
discharging stone storms she moved about appallingly. And on seeing both Rama and Lakshmana who are 
being overspread by storms of stones from all-over, then the illustrious sage Vishvamitra spoke this 
sentence.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Enough is your compassion Rama, she is a sinister, behaviourally malevolent, a hinderer of rituals, 
and this yakshii gets a grip on herself in a short time by her illusory powers. Sun is going to set 
in a short time, and only before that time she shall be destroyed, for demons at dusk and afterwards 
become unassailable, indeed.&quot; So said sage Viswamitra to Rama.
</p>

<p class="tat">
When Vishvamitra addressed him thus, Rama displaying his capacity in sonic archery forestalled that 
yakshii who has gone into invisibility and storming stone-storms, with his arrows. And when the 
arrays of arrows obstructed her who possesses illusional powers, she dashed towards Rama and 
Lakshmana blaring stridently. And Rama struck an arrow in her chest who is invading and speedily 
swooping down like a thunderbolt, and thus she is readily felled down and totally dropped dead, too.
</p>

<p class="tat">
On seeing her who is horrendous in her shape is eliminated Indra and other gods have highly esteemed 
Rama saying, “admirable, admirable is this act. The thousand eyed and the destroyer of enemy’s 
citadels Indra then spoke with high satisfaction, and even all of the gods are gladdened and said to 
Vishvamitra this way.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, sage Vishvamitra, you are blessed, all the groups of wind-gods along with Indra are pleased, so 
you please show more concern for Raghava. The sons of Prajapati Krishasva who are valiant by their 
virtue and who possess ascetic strength, oh, Brahman, they may be offered to Raghava.
</p>

<p class="comment">
These are the sons like missiles of Krishaashava Prajaapati. About them, the divine weaponry and 
their birth, c.f. 21st sarga/chapter, verse 10 to 20.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Rama is steadfast in following your assignments and thus he is the worthy receiver of those 
missiles, and this prince has to accomplish a very great deed of gods.” So said gods to Vishvamitra. 
All the gods on saying thus and on extolling Vishvamitra they contentedly returned to heavens, and 
then the sunset has come to pass.
</p>

<p class="tat">
That best sage is satisfied with Rama and gladdened for the eradication of Tataka kissed the 
forehead of and then said this sentence. &quot;Here we stay for tonight, Rama, the august one for a gaze, 
and tomorrow morning we will go to that hermitage of mine.” So said Vishvamitra to Rama. On 
listening sage Vishvamitra&#39;s words, Dasharatha&#39;s son Rama, comfortably stayed that night there in 
that forest of Tataka.
</p>

<p class="tat">
On that very day alone that forest of Tataka too is released from the curse, and it shone forth like 
the luxurious heavenly garden of Kubera, namely Chiatra Ratha.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama while being eulogised by the groups of celestials and liberated Souls for complete elimination 
of yaksha&#39;s daughter, namely Tataka, stayed there along with the sage only to be awakened by the 
next day’s sunrise.&nbsp;

<p class="ItrSloka">
Test for Rama's discipline.

<p class="comment">
The materialists view this episode as a function of Rama in eradicating natural 
calamities like dust storms, pellet storms in an uncultivable land, on the line 
of the episode of Ahalya. In this episode Rama&#39;s discipline is also tested. Whether 
he simply follows what is instructed or whether he uses his own discretion, is the 
topic here. Rama coupled both and eradicates Tataka, tough he doubts for a while 
whether to eliminate a female.<em>strii vadha sahasaa na kartavyaH viruupakaaraNaadi strii daNDanam eva 
prathamataH kriyate – dharmaakuutam</em></p>

<em>

<p class="comment">
This is required for the endowment of deadly missiles 
to Rama in coming chapters. Hence Vishvamitra asks Rama to depend upon his own self-confidence 
to undertake this deed as at 1-24-30b, 31a. On satisfying with the eligibility of 
Rama to receive missiles with this episode, Vishvamitra accords those deadly weapons 
later.</p>
