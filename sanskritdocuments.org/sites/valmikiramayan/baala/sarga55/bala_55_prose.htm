<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties
<br>Sarga 55 in Prose</h3>

<p class="txt">
Vishvamitra ruins Vashishta&#39;s hermitage on acquiring missiles at the grace of God 
Shiva by practising a paramount ascesis. When the forces generated by Wish-Milker 
Sacred Cow, namely Kaamadhenu, eliminated Vishvamitra&#39;s army and his hundred sons, 
he felt indignant and pray unto Shiva for bestowal of unusual missiles. On getting 
them, he again comes to Sage Vashishta&#39;s Hermitage and ruins it completely. Then 
extremely infuriated Sage Vashishta resorts to his Brahma-baton to confront Vishvamitra.</p>

<p class="txt">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="verloc">
.</p>

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then on seeing them, the warriors earlier created by the Sacred Cow, Shabala, who 
are perplexed by the missiles of Vishvamitra and flurrying, Vashishta started to 
incite her, &#39;oh, wish-milker, generate more forces by your capacity of yoga...
</p>

<p class="tat">
Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration about the legend of Vishvamitra to 
Rama.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;From the &#39;hums&#39; of her mooing born are sunshine similar Kaamboja-s and from her 
udder born are the weaponry wielding Pahlava-s... From the area of her privates 
Yavana-s, likewise from her rectal area Shaka-s, and from her hair-roots Mleccha-s, 
Haariitaa-s along with Kirataka-s are issued forth... By them the Yavana, the Mleccha 
etc., forces generated by the Sacred Cow, Vishvamitra&#39;s forces with its foot-soldiers 
and elephants, and with its chariots along with their horses are utterly slaughtered 
at that very moment...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;A band of hundred sons of Vishvamitra on seeing their army, utterly slaughtered 
by the vital spirit of Vashishta, took up divers sorts of weapons and exasperatedly 
sprinted forth towards that supreme meditator among all meditators, but that spirited 
sage Vashishta completely burnt down them all, only by his blasting hum.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Thus that vitally spirited sage Vashishta rendered those sons of Vishvamitra, along 
with horses, chariots, foot-soldiers to ashes in a wink. On seeing his sons and 
his forces are utterly ruined, that very highly glorious Vishvamitra was engulfed 
in a disgraceful distress.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Like a tideless ocean his warfare did not tide him over, and like a fangless serpent 
his hiss of warring could not fang any, and like a wingless bird pitiable is his 
flightless plight of fightback, and like a shineless sun in an eclipse, Vishvamitra 
plunged into a lustreless state of his own illustriousness, when his forces are 
ruined along with his sons...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When all his intrepidity and impetuosity are ruined an indolence bechanced upon 
him, and then on bidding one son for the kingdom, &#39;you rule the earth with the duties 
of kingcraft...&#39; thus saying Vishvamitra took recourse to forests...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On going to the side of Himalayas, whereat it is adored by kinnaraa-s and uragaa-s, 
the nymphs and nymphean serpents, he that Vishvamitra, a great practiser of ascesis, 
undertook an austere ascesis for the sake of beneficence of the Great God, Shiva...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;After a long lost time, the Holy Bull masted God of Gods, Shiva, has shown himself 
to that great-saint Vishvamitra, for He is a ready boon-giver...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, king, for which purpose you undertook this ascesis... tell that, what really 
is tellable by you... what is the boon that you beseech... that be made known to 
me for I am the boon-giver at the ready...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Thus said by God Shiva to Vishvamitra of great sagacity, Vishvamitra on reverencing 
that Great God Shiva said this way...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh! Mahadeva, the Impeccable Great God... providing that you are gladdened by 
my ascetic devotion,<font color="#B3003A"> dhanur veda, </font>the Holy Writ of 
Archery, with its complemental and supplemental Writs, and along with its summational
<font color=" #B3003A">Upanishad-s, </font>together with its preternatural doctrines... 
they may kindly be bestowed upon me... &#39;Whatever missiles are there with gods, fiends, 
gandharva-s, yaksha-s, and demons... oh, God, the Exquisite... let them dawn upon 
me... for you alone are the God of Gods, your blessings alone can fulfil my aspiration...&#39;
</p>

<p class="tat">
Thus Vishvamitra entreated God Shiva.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;So be it!&#39; Thus on sanctifying Vishvamitra and his aspiration, the God of Gods, 
Shiva flashed by...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Vishvamitra who was already a mightier Kshatriya, now on acquiring missiles from 
the God of Gods, Shiva will not he come forth conjoined with mightiest conceit and 
then will not his conceitedness be plethoric, like a plethoric ocean... na, it canna 
be...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;By vitality Vishvamitra is like an ocean on a Full Moon day with a rough riptide, 
with his tidal missiles... and oh, Rama, he deemed that sagaciously mighty sage 
Vashishta is now &#39;dead...&#39;
</p>

<p class="tat">
Then on going to the threshold of Vashishta &#39;s hermitage that king propelled his 
missiles, thereby completely burnt down that ascetic woodland by the holocaust of 
those missiles, in its entirety... On seeing the turbo-jetting missiles of Vishvamitra 
jetted by his sparkling intellect, hundreds of saints were frightened and they very 
speedily fled in hundreds of ways... Whoever is the disciple of Vashishta and whichever 
is either animal or a bird, all are fearsomely frightened and fled hastily to numerous 
directions, in thousands...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;The threshold of that broad-minded Vashishta&#39;s hermitage fell void, and in a wink 
it became dumbfounded alike an arid land as every shrub, herb and tree is cindery, 
and every bird, animal and stock is an evacuee...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Although Vashishta is shouting at them time and again saying, &#39;fear not... fear 
not... I wish to dissipate that son of Gaadhi... Vishvamitra... like Sun demists 
the mist...&#39;
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On saying that way to the evacuees that great-resplendent sage and a best one among 
best meditators said this word to Vishvamitra, rancorously...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;You the senseless... by which reason you have havocked this hermitage well nourished 
for a long time, thus indeed, you are a reprehensible one and thereby you will not 
survive any longer...</p>

<p class="comment">
Vividly: &#39;when I have sensibly nourished the trees, birds and animals or disciples, 
saints and sages, in indoctrinating them the true <em>dharma </em>&#39;righteous duty...&#39; 
observable by each of the birthed being, what necessitated you to harm the harmless 
&#39;fly anywhere&#39; birds, &#39;new to world&#39; calves and &#39;take what you need&#39; trees and animals... 
you should have confronted me headlong, instead... but you on seeing such a beatitude 
of this hermitage, you have become envious in your self-aggrandisement... and as 
said that, &#39;a senseless reprehensible being, may it be a human, animal, bird, or 
a reptile is unfit to survive for long...&#39; and now you are transposable with such 
a senseless being by this act of yours, which you have undertaken with the notion 
of &#39;survival of the fittest...&#39; thereby I will now show you who is fit enough to 
survive, an instructor or an intruder, in effacing your survival...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On saying thus, that extremely infuriated Sage Vashishta post-hastily up-heaved 
his baton, which is alike the fumeless Ultimate Fire of End Time, and the other 
baton of Yama, the Terminator, and affronted Vishvamitra...&quot;
</p>

<p class="tat">
Thus, Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend.</p>
