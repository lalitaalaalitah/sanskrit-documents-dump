<p class="txt">
Rama takes aim with Vishnu&#39;s longbow and asks Parashu Rama to choose the target to release the arrow, 
as arrow of that bow cannot go astray. Parashu Rama opts for elimination of his ascetic merit and heavenly 
realms thereby. Rama releases the bow annihilating that merit and after that, Parashu Rama retreats 
into oblivion.</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing that sentence of Rama of Jamadagni, then Rama of Dasharatha said this to him in a courtly 
owing to the presence of his father Dasharatha.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Bhaargava Rama, whatsoever endeavour you have strived for freeing yourself from the indebtedness 
towards your father, I have heard of them, and oh, Brahman, we appreciate for your achieving that freeness 
from your paternal debt, but... Oh, Bhaargava Rama, demeaning me as though I am timorous, hence incapable 
to handle the bow, and hence I am an ignoble one for Kshatriya-hood, is meaningless... come on, now 
you may see my spiritedness and sprightliness...&quot; So said Rama to Bhaargava.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Up to here both these Rama-s are in close quarters with other few present there. After this dialogue, 
they have moved a little away from the throng and facing each other as true combatants. A swordsman 
or an archer needs an arm-length, or sword-length or bow-length, at the least, to swagger his weapon. 
This place is to be assumed as an isolated place and no one is seeing or listening. This scene has an 
analogy in Maha Bharata when Krishna teaches Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. There, it is said, that Krishna 
froze the time to teach all the eighteen chapters, and none among two sides of warring factions are 
aware of Krishna, his teachings, or of Arjuna, excepting Sanjaya, who is placed at a distant place and 
has seen all with his wisdom-eye. Here we have to borrow that wisdom-eye of Sanjaya and see at these 
two Rama-s and their actions. When their episode is over the mist cast around them, rather on our eyes, 
will be cleared, when Rama returns to his father. This is said in later verses. Further more, all the 
people available there are rendered unconscious at the arrival of Bhaargava Rama, and a few like Dasharatha, 
Vashishta, Rama&#39;s brothers are with senses. So, even if they hear and see this scene, those listeners 
or seers do no harm in revealing Rama&#39;s godhood to world, or in particular to Ravana.</p>

<p class="tat">
Raghava, the nimble-handed vanquisher of his opponents, speaking thus in high dudgeon expropriated that 
estimable weapon, namely the longbow of Vishnu, from the hand of Bhaargava Rama, along with the long-arrow 
that is already fitted on it...
</p>

<p class="comment">
&quot;and, along the same lines Rama also said to have extricated the essential nature of Bhaargava...&#39; The 
above said &#39;distancing&#39; of these two Rama-s has another purpose. Rama has certain innate nature of making 
his observers enchanted by his very personality. Even Ravana looks at him adoringly in the war scene. 
This apart, his hand has certain ability to extricate the innate nature of others, should he lay his 
hand on them. We rarely see him touching or patting others, except for Seetha, Lakshmana, Hanuma, and 
say a squirrel etc. So, it is believed that, Rama has now expropriated the essential nature of Vishnu 
from Bhaargava Rama, while snatching the bow from his hands. For this Padma Puraana says:&nbsp; <em>
iti uktvaa devii vaiShNavyaa shaktyaa tad gataayaa saha | jagraaha vaiShNavam caapam vinayena ca liilayaa 
||</em> &#39;oh, Devi Parvati, saying so Rama took away the Vishnu&#39;s anima from Bhaargava Rama, along with 
bow of Vishnu, sportily and obediently, too...&#39; Thus, Rama of Dasharatha bade goodbye to his earlier 
incarnation, Parashu Rama, as two swords cannot be in one sheath.</p>

<p class="tat">
On lifting up the bow that is already fitted with an arrow on bowstring, then Rama started to take aim 
with it, but being indecisive about the target, then Rama of Dasharatha irefully said this to Rama of 
Jamagadni.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama of Bhaargava, even if you are a Brahman you are eliminable, but because of your relationship 
with Vishvamitra, and because you are a venerable one for me, I am disinclined to release this arrow 
that exterminates your life...</p>

<p class="comment">
Bhaargava-s are Brahman-s and a Brahman cannot be killed <em>braahmaNo na hantavya</em> then how Rama 
is prepared to eliminate a Brahman, subjecting himself to the sin called &#39;Brahman killing...&#39; <em>brahma 
hatyaa paataka...</em> There is no sin in eliminating a Brahman who is weaponed and warring. <em>tathaa 
ca bhaarate raaja dharme kR^iShNam prati bhiiShmaH - pitruun pitaamahaan pitryam guruun sambandhi baandhavaan 
| mithyaa pravR^ittaan yaH sa~Nkhye nihanyaa dharma eva saH ||</em> Maha Bharata, shannti parva. &#39;It 
is no sin to eliminated fathers, grandfathers, teachers, and the like [even if they are Brahman-s,] 
for they are under an illusion, called war...&#39; So said Bhiishma to Krishna and thereby Panadava-s have 
eliminated Drona, Kripa, Ashvaddhaama and suchlike weaponed Brahman-s in war, but not in peace. There 
are many more such sayings of Bhiishma. Here Parashu Rama said that he will give a duel to Rama, hence 
he is no more a Brahman when he raises a weapon. And he is a blood relation of Vishvamitra, and that 
corner of mercy is not allowing Rama to release the arrow on Parashu Rama.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Bhaargava Rama, either this motility of yours at the speed of your mind, or even those unparalleled 
realms of heavens which you have earned by the power of your ascesis, I will eliminate whichever you 
wish... &quot;This Vishnu&#39;s divine arrow is the conqueror of opponents&#39; citadels, and a vanquisher of their 
vigour and vainglory, and it will not fall through wastefully... isn&#39;t it!&quot; So said archer Rama to axeman 
Rama.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The debate on the superiority of Vishnu or Shiva may have its own mythological import, but as far as 
Ramayana is considered, the eulogy for Vishnu&#39;s longbow is intended to suggest the all-powerful capacity 
of Vishnu in eliminating demons and to lead the epic to its own goal. Dharmaakuutam has to say this:
<em>prakR^ite - adhikam menire vishNum - iti raamaayaNa vacanam tu agre kartavya sakala raakShasa vadha 
hetu bhuuta vaiShNava dhanShaH praashasta pratipaadana param j~nyeyam |</em> Hence the mythological 
quarrels have no place in Ramayana.</p>

<p class="tat">
Gods together with the assemblages of sages have come keeping the Grandparent Brahma at their fore, 
likewise the gandharva-s, apsara-s, siddha-s, caarana-s, kinnaraa-s, yaksha-s, sprites and reptilian 
beings have also come to see Rama who is now wielding the extraordinary longbow of Vishnu, and extremely 
amazing event that is going to ensue.
</p>

<p class="tat">
The &#39;amazing event&#39; is not the handing over or taking over of longbow, but it is the transference of 
the essential nature of Bhaargava Rama to Dasharatha Rama. Nrisimha Puraana has this: <em>tataH parashu 
raamasya dehaat nirgatasya vaiShNavam | pashyataam sarva devaanaam tejo raamam upaavishat ||</em>Then, 
when Rama is ready to take aim with the arrow on that inscrutable longbow, and when the worlds are being 
rendered as insentient, then that Rama of Jamadagni is rendered vigourless and he stared up at Rama 
of Dasharatha.</p>

<p class="comment">
Vividly: When the aura of Vishnu available in Bhaargava Rama has entered Dasharatha Rama through that 
inscrutable longbow of Vishnu, Dasharatha Rama&#39;s aura dazzled like that of Vishnu, and that dazzlement 
of Vishnu&#39;s aura threw the world in a daze, and then that aura-less, thus vigourless Bhaargava Rama 
has nothing to do except to stare at Vishnu-like Rama, with upraised eyes.</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama of Jamadagni is calloused as his vitality is subdued by the radiance of that lotus-petal eyed Rama 
of Dasharatha, and he spoke to Rama of Dasharatha, slowly and softly.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Once, when I donated entire earth to Sage Kashyapa, Kashyapa told me &#39;uninhabitable is my domain, viz., 
this earth for you...&#39; thus...
</p>

<p class="comment">
A donor cannot enjoy a gift anymore, once donated to the donee. And if the donor still clings around 
that donation, it does not come under the true definition of &#39;donation.&#39; Hence, Parashu Rama is asked 
to depart from this world. Hence he has gone to the ethereal mountain called Mt. Mahendra.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Such as I was, in my observance of my mentor Kashyapa&#39;s order I do not spend nights on this earth from 
then afterwards, oh, Kakutstha Rama, as I made over this earth for Kashyapa, indeed... Thereby oh, valiant 
one, it will be inapt of you to impair this motility of mine, oh, Raghava, I will depart with the speed 
of cerebration to Mt. Mahendra, a par excellent mountain... But I triumphed over matchless realms of 
heavens with my ascesis, oh, Rama, you may hash them up with that irreversible arrow... let there be 
no time-lag... I have realized your touch of nature as that of the Immutable Supreme Being, God of Gods, 
the Exterminator of the demon Madhu, namely Vishnu, by the touch of your handling that bow... oh, enemy-inflamer, 
blessedness alone betides you...
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;All of these gods who have come collectively are beholding you and your next move, for you are an unequalled 
one in you achievements and to whom there is no counter-dueller in conflicts...
</p>

<p class="comment">
Parashu Rama is hastening up Dasharatha Rama to finish business quickly, otherwise the nature of Rama 
and his incarnation will publicized, not by these two Rama-s, but the game watching gods. If these spectators 
stay for a long time in sky, some airborne demon will let the cat out of the bag.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Kakutstha Rama, you are the lord of the triad of worlds, such as you are, you faced me down, and 
it is malapropos to say that this is a disgrace to me... It will be apt of you to unloose that unsurpassed 
arrow, oh, Rama, as you have ethical commitment to wipe out demons as I wiped out menacing kings, and 
should you unloosen that arrow now I wish to depart to the ethereal mountain Mt. Mahendra, a point of 
no return for me...&quot; So said Parashu Rama to Dasharatha Rama.
</p>

<p class="tat">
While Rama of Jamadagni is speaking that way, that venturesome and blessed Rama of Dasharatha shot off 
that nonpareil arrow from that longbow of Vishnu. On seeing all of his realms of heavens are shot-blasted 
by Rama of Dasharatha, Rama of Jamadagni vanished in a trice to Mt. Mahendra, the heavenly mountain.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Rather, ready to depart... as he is given some more role-play in next verses.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then dissipated is the darkness in all the divisions and likewise in all the subdivisions of compass, 
and the gods with the assemblages of sages extolled Rama, in whose hands the longbow is upraised.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Please refer the endnote about this longbow and how it is passed on to Janaka&#39;s dynasty.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then that dab hand at axe, Rama of Jamadagni, on acclaiming, and even on making circumambulations to 
Rama of Dasharatha, went on his own way into oblivion.

Longbows of Shiva and Vishnu
</p>

<p class="comment">
The bestowal of Shiva&#39;s bow to the dynasty of Janaka is said variously at various places. In the hermitage 
Vishvamitra it is said that the bow is given in Vedic-ritual <font color="#B3003A">taddhi puurvam narashreSTha 
dattam sadasi daivataiH | 1-31-8</font> In the previous chapter it is said that the bow is given in 
the hand of Devaraata <font color="#B3003A">devaraatasya raaja R^iSeH dadau haste sa saayakam | 1-75-20</font> 
And earlier it is said to be given in Dasksha&#39;s ritual <font color="#B3003A">dakSa yaj~na vadhe puurvam 
dhanuH aayamya viiryavaan | 1-66-9</font> Seetha says about this to ascetic Lady Anasuya that Rain-god 
gave this to Janaka&#39;s dynasty <font color="#B3003A">mahaayaj~ne tadaa tasya varuNena mahaatmanaa | dattam 
dhanur varam priityaa tuuNii ca akSayya saayakau Ayodhya II-118.</font> These statements, though not 
self-contradictory, and though they create a little confusion, they all are correct. When Daksha&#39;s Vedic-ritual 
is devastated, Shiva wanted to throw back the useless bow, that was worsted by Vishnu&#39;s bow, on the 
face of gods. But gods fearing for the ire of Shiva requested Shiva to give that bow to Devaraata, on 
their behalf. Shiva gave it to Devaraata as a trust, through Rain-god Varuna, but Shiva did no bequeath 
it. Later Janaka on appeasing gods in Vedic-ritual asked them to leave the bow once for all in Janaka 
Dynasty. Gods have agreed to it. And Rama broke it.</p>

<p class="comment">
Now Dasharatha Rama gives back the other bow of Vishnu brought by Parashu Rama to the same Rain-god 
Varuna, who is present there at both Rama-s, in the thin air, when the environ is enshrouded by certain 
darkness, and when Rama is last seen with that upraised longbow at 1-76-23, and just before darkness 
is dissipated, Rama gives that bow to Rain-god, according to the first verse in next chapter.</p>

<p class="comment">
Well known is Krishna&#39;s showing his Cosmic Form <font color="#B3003A">vishva ruupa</font> to Arjuna, 
while teaching Bhagavad Gita in Maha Bharata. But that Bharata records Rama&#39;s display of His Cosmic 
form to Parashu Rama, only at this juncture. In Ch. 89 of <font color="#B3003A">anushaashanika parva</font> 
of Maha Bharata it is said in detail as: <em>pashya maam svena ruupeNa cakShuH te vitaraami aham | tato 
raama shariire vai raama pashyati bhaargavaH |aadityaan pavamaanaan rudraan saadhyaan ca sa marud gaNaana 
| pitaro hutaashanaH caiva nakShatraaNi grahaaH tathaa |</em> and a long account follows on this. But 
this has not been amplified or explained in other texts, due to unknown reasons. However, it is not 
part of Valmiki Ramayana.</p>
