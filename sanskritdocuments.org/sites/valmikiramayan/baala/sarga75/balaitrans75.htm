<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p class="txt">
			The visitant Parashu Rama narrates the legends of bows of Vishnu and Shiva to Rama. Unheedful of the request 
			of Dasharatha to spare his sons, Parashu Rama addresses Dasharatha Rama directly and asks him to take an aim 
			with the longbow of Vishnu, and if Dasharatha Rama is capable to do so, Parashu Rama says that he will give 
			a duel to him.</p>

<p class="comment">
This longbow of Shiva is reported as given after the devastation of the ritual of Daksha Prajaapati, the father of Sati 
and the father-in-law of Shiva as said at 1-66-9: <em>dakSa yaj~na vadhe puurvam dhanuH aayamya viiryavaan |</em> This ritual 
of Daksha is a composite of many problems. Shiva neither as god nor as the son-in-law of Daksha is invited to that ritual, 
Shiva&#39;s consort Sati self-immolates herself in the her father&#39;s ritual, Viira Bhadra and other deputies of Shiva depredate 
that ritual, and this <em>shiva keshava yuddha</em> &#39;duelling of Shiva and Vishnu...&#39; happens... all to show - a single 
person&#39;s disinterestedness ruins even a holy marriage. Here Daksha was uninterested to give his daughter Sati in marriage 
to Shiva.</p>

The odds between Vishnu and Shiva</p>

<p class="comment">
This is a long drawn bloody quarrel between the two sects of <font color="#B3003A">vaiSNavism</font> Vishnu faith and
<font color="#B3003A">shaivism</font> Shiva faith, over centuries. Here it is doubtlessly expressed in the epic that Vishnu 
is superior to Shiva. <em>anena shivaat viShNoH utkarShaH 
pratipaaditam - ayam eva arthaH | dk</em> &#39;by this Vishnu is proposed to be superior to Shiva...&#39; but it does 
not mean &#39;every time or everlastingly...&#39; Insofar as the incarnations are concerned, it is Vishnu, but not Shiva. In philosophy, 
both are one and in theology, they are separate. <em>sR^iShTi sthiti anta kaaraNaat 
brahma vishNu shivaatmikaam | sa sanj~naam yaati bhagavaan eka eva janaardanaH || vishNu puraaNa api cet samaram praapya 
bhaviShyasi maam adhikaH | bhaarata - droNa parva ekam eva advitiiyam brahma - sat eva saumaya idam agram assiit - sarvam 
khalvidam brahma - brahmaa vaa idam agra asiit - hiraNya garbha samavartata agre - antar bahiH ca tat sarvam vyaapya naaraayaNa 
sthitaH - eka eva rudro na dvitiiyaaya tasthe - ekam sad vipraa bnahudhaa vadanti ekam santam bahudhaa kalpayanti - abedha 
shruti</em> where the last one is &#39;when there is only one Absolute wise men and poets create many of his forms...&#39; 
to explain in ordinary parlance, that too through Puraana-s. This is because of the complexity of Vedas. In fact, Vedas 
do not tell anything straightaway &#39;this god, that is god...&#39; but asks us, rather intuits us, to infer ourselves about the 
nature of god, according to our own IQ. And to be precise, Vedic gods are different from Puranic gods and Veda holds on 
to one Brahman, or The Absolute. The Rain-god, Fire-god, Indra et al are the instrumental gods in knowing that Absolute. 
The content of Vedas is just like the complexity of complex video game of present day. The more you play you either get 
yourself addicted to it, or shun it, or get demented by it.</p>

<p class="comment">
Vedas go on saying pure truths in plain terms like: <em>sham naH suurya urucakShu 
udaitu sham nshcatasraH pradiipto bhavantu | sham naH dhruvayo bhavantu naH sindhavaH shamu san santi aapaH || R^igveda</em> 
7-35-8 - &#39;Bless that the sun, with extensive radiance, Rises for peace. May the four quarters of horizon, Be auspicious 
for peace and harmony...&#39; What is so great about the sun or his radiance? If we persist in asking why this is said like 
that, then a dozen other quotes will be brought in to explain the idea behind it. Again another hymn:
<em>sahasra shiirShaa puruShaH 
sahasraakSha sahasra paat | R^igved</em> 10-90-1 - &#39;He has thousands of heads, He has thousands of eyes...&#39; 
It would be ridiculous to think of a god with thousands of heads and thousands of eyes, but if it is explained &#39;He has thousands 
of heads, to think about mankind, and he has thousands of eyes to watch over the good and bad deeds of mankind... it may 
be meaningful. Max Muller has this to say about the study of Vedas:</p>

<p class="comment">
Of course, this learning of Vedas by heart is carried on under a strict discipline; it is, in fact, considered as a sacred 
duty. A native friend of mine... tells me that a boy, who is to be brought up as a student of Rig Veda, has to spend about 
eight years in the house of his teacher. He has to learn ten books: first, the hymns of Rig ved; then a prose treatise on 
sacrifices, called the <font color="#B3003A">braahmaNa</font>; then the so-called Forest book or <font color="#B3003A">aranyaka</font>; 
then the rules of domestic ceremonies; and lastly, six treatises on pronunciation, grammar, etymology, metre, astronomy, 
and ceremonial...&#39; India can it what teach us, by Max Muller - a recent republication of Penguin.</p>
<p class="comment">
All the above is for no practical utility in these days, except for an enquiry into that &#39;Brahman.&#39; So also there is a probability 
for phonetic problem <font color="#B3003A">uccaraNa doSa</font> in Vedas which causes <font color="#B3003A">pratya vaaya</font> 
a boomeranging bad effect. If we wish to chant its hymn &#39;oh, Indra, slay my enemies...&#39; and if a diphthong or a diagraph 
is mispronounced it becomes &#39;Oh, Indra, kill me, instead of my enemies...&#39; and it is said to happen that way
<font color="#B3003A">yad bhaavam tad bhavati...</font> Unless they are practised for a life time, they are un-understandable, 
hence they are set aside and Puraana-s are brought in their place. Further, the effect of Vedas is said to be declining 
according to <font color="#B3003A">yuga dharma</font> era theory... What that was available in <font color="#B3003A">satya 
yuga</font> a period where the conflict was only between god and man, for e.g., the legend of Hrishcandra and his truth 
speaking, which stands tested by almost all gods, but that truthfulness is lessened in <font color="#B3003A">treat yuga</font> 
Ramayana&#39;s period, where the conflict was between man and demons, which dharma is further lessened in
<font color="#B3003A">dvaapara yuga</font> period of Maha Bharata, where the conflict is among one&#39;s own brothers, and that 
much dharma of that period is almost extinct in <font color="#B3003A">kali yuga</font> which is obvious, from the known 
history of India, where the conflicts are going on between man and man - husband and wife, father and son, neighbour and 
neighbour, and so on.<br>
<p class="comment">
This is on par with the four-legged <font color="#B3003A">dharma</font>, The Holy Bull, <font color="#B3003A">nandi</font> 
loosing its legs one after the other and now you will see that Bull in any sculpture with half raised right foreleg, where 
other three went under its belly.</p>

<p class="comment">
So Puraana-s are evolved to throw some light on what Vedas have to say, of course with some religious overtones. Elsewhere 
we have detailed about Puraana-s of them Shiva and Vishnu Puraana-s are though prominent, but their adherers quarrel tooth 
and nail about the superiority of Shiva or Vishnu. In Vishnu Puraana many instances of coalescence of Vishnu with Shiva 
are narrated <em>tvat vaakya gauravaat etat 
mayaa cakram nivartitam | tvayaa yat abhayam dattam tat datttam akhilam mayaa -</em> Krishna says to Shiva 
at the time of eliminating a demon called Baana Asura, &#39;As you say I have taken back my disc, and if you give a boon I deem 
all that is given by me...&#39; So many instances can be quoted like this. But here Parashu Rama has no intention to kill Dasharatha 
Rama, as said in Padma Puraana: <em>rarakSha bhagavaan - bhaargava 
raamaH - ekam ikShvaakostu mahaa kulam | maataamahasya anvayatvaat reNukaa vacanaat tathaa |</em> &#39;that god 
Bhaargava Rama safeguarded one great dynasty of Ikshvaku-s, for they are related to his grandmother, besides at the request 
of Renuka Devi, his mother...&#39; So, god Bhaargava Rama is a nepotist and saved Dasharatha Rama. Not so, Bhaargava Rama is 
neither a nepotist nor a god to be worshipped. He is not worshipped because his incarnation is not a full incarnation of 
Vishnu as Dasharatha Rama. Only the wrathful impetuosity of Vishnu is incarnated like Bhaargava Rama to perform butchery 
and even infanticide. <em>bhaargavo ati dR^iptaH prasiddhaH 
tadaaniim ca krodha andha iti sva kShatriya vadhaat upratam shastra sannyaasam ca parityajya capala iti viditaH</em> 
&#39;Bhaargava Rama is a highly impudent personality and blinded by his wrath, thus to eliminate his own Kshatriya-s [namely 
his own relatives, Dasharatha and his sons; again the caste system is peeping in, isn&#39;t it!] On overstepping his pledge 
of renunciation of weaponry, he came... hence his actions are faltering...&#39; <font color="#B3003A">appayaa diikshita</font>, 
a shaivaite. He came here to perform certain unsaid action, which we will see in next episode.</p>
