<h3>Introduction</h3>

			who came before marriages, now takes Bharata and Shatrughna to his kingdom. Rama and Lakshmana from then on 
			are engaged in the welfare works of their subjects, at the behest of their father. Rama and Seetha will then 
			enter the threshold of their blissful married life.</p>

overjoyed in the functions of receiving the four brides. [1-77-10]</p>

<p class="comment">
Again this &#39;receiving bride&#39; is an elaborate variety of fun and games of womenfolk will take place, at which place there 
is almost no entry to men. For example, name telling. An Indian bride, or the later time wife is supposed to not to call 
her husband by his name. It is a sacred taboo, and her addressing shall be in genderless, person-less, and numberless hooting, 
cooing or calling like <em>e jii - o jii - emanDii - ennango - shuniye</em> so on. To cite one such ceremony it is &#39;naming 
game.&#39; Here the bride is compelled to tell the name of her husband, and she will be hesitating to do so, because of her 
newness to this house or to her husband. After some teasing attempts, she mutters her husband&#39;s name, and then only she 
will be admitted into certain chamber or room. But dwindling are these games, and dampening is that fun, in these days of 
readymade marriages. Then why Dasharatha shall be overjoyed at these womanly functions, they do all those womanish things... 
because, Dasharatha wanted his palace to be in festivity, with just one son. But four are forced on him and they too obtained 
four brides in one go, hence fourfold is his happiness. It may be observed that Kaikeyi is the lone queen with &#39;beauty&#39; 
as her attribute, and the problem with her is seeded here alone, saying that enchantment of Dasharatha towards her outweighs 
his affection to Rama, later.</p>

This &#39;paying respects to respectable elders&#39; is but one line. In reality, the torsos of those that pay respects will be 
put to test, because they have to &#39;pay&#39; by bending and touching the feet of elders, each time to each, <em>paada abhivandana, 
pai lagoo</em> . And if the girls are from jeans or pants culture, [because days have gone,] they will be fresh and new 
to bridal sari, which itself will be a weight to carry. And many times we see the young brides falling on the blessing couple 
because her bridal sari gets entangled in the toes of the bride, and she is not yet ready to manage it. So goes on this

<p class="comment">
The other mms use <em>raamaH tu</em> instead of <em>raamaH ca</em> where this <em>tu</em> says a difference. Then, &#39;Rama 
is busy in welfare and other works of state, <em>tu</em> &#39;but&#39; he is also impassioned for Seetha. And he is <em>manasvii</em> 
&#39;hearty one&#39; warm, friendly, spirited etc., are his dispositions for kingdom, people, governmental works <em>tu</em> &#39;but&#39; 
he is that &#39;hearty&#39; for Seetha... Hence <em>tad gataH - tasyaam gataH</em> &#39;he pervaded her psyche, hence casketed in her 
heart... In the other mms it will be <em>tasyaaH hR^idi nityam samarpitaH</em> &#39;heart of Seetha is &#39;always&#39; dedicated to 
Rama... and that word <em>nityam</em> &#39;always, eternal, everlasting...&#39; couple. So, they may be a couple from time immemorial
<em>tu</em> &#39;but&#39; they are as good as a fresh and fervent young couple... <em>bahuun R^ituun</em> &#39;for many, many seasons 
to come...&#39; he is disporting with Seetha. Why tell seasons when there is calculated calendar with years, decades, and centuries... 
Not so... their disporting is according to seasons, with seasonal environ, with a seasonable togetherness... <em>vijahaara</em> 
is grammatically a <em>parasmai padi</em> then the fruition goes to the subject, and subject of the verse is Rama, so he 
alone is the enjoyer and insatiate is his enjoyment with Seetha, even during and after <em>bahuun R^ituun</em> many, and 
many seasons. <em>niravadhika paraspara baddha anuraaga abhivR^iddhi</em> &#39; an endless, mutual, conjugal, impassion and 
its enrichment - the self-content bliss of monogamy.</p>

Here the good old saying <em>ati ruupavatii siitaa - ati muurkhaaH ca raavaNa</em> &#39;Seetha is the greatest beauty, Ravana

<p class="comment">
The &#39;son of king&#39; suggests that Rama as a prospective king has no paucity for any items of enjoyment. The best &#39;princess&#39; 
suggests that Seetha is no less than him, but now her prosperity edges on that of Rama, because she has Rama as her husband. 
And how will be their mutual affection and love? Many more pages can be written on it, but insufficiently, and perhaps inefficiently.
