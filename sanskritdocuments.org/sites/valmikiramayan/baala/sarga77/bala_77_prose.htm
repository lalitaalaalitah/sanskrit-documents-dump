	<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties<br>&nbsp;Sarga 77 in Prose</h3>
        <p class="txt">The wedding party arrives at Ayodhya on the exit of Parashu Rama. Yudhaajit, the maternal uncle 
		of Bharata, who came before marriages, now takes Bharata and Shatrughna to his kingdom. Rama and Lakshmana from 
		then on are engaged in the welfare works of their subjects, at the behest of their father. Rama and Seetha will 
		then enter the threshold of their blissful married life.</p>
  
<p class="verloc">.----</p>
<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="tat">On the departure of Rama of Jamadagni, that most glorious Rama of Dasharatha is quietened at heart, and 
he gave away that longbow of Vishnu into the hand of inimitable Rain-god. </p>
<p class="comment">On this longbow and its giving to god of Rain, some discussion is incorporated in the earlier 
chapter.</p>
<p class="tat">On paying respects to sage Vashishta and to the other important sages, Rama, the delight of Raghu&#39;s 
lineage, placatingly addressed his agitated father Dasharatha. &quot;Rama of Jamadagni has gone on his way, you may now order 
the army under your wardship, for which you are the lord, to move on towards Ayodhya...&quot; So said Rama to his father. </p>
<p class="tat">On hearing the words of Rama king Dasharatha hugged his son with both of his arms, and kissed on the 
forehead of Raghava, and king Dasharatha is gladdened to listen about the departure of Parashu Rama, and then he is 
further gladdened in deeming that he and his sons took a rebirth. </p>
<p class="tat">Then the King Dasharatha ordered that legion to move ahead, and then they all went towards delightful 
city Ayodhya, whose royal highways are wetted with water, sprinkled with bunches of flowers, decorated with banners and 
bannerettes up above them, and reverberating with high sounding bugle-horns. Further, those highways are replete with 
urbanites welcomers who are handling welcoming kits which are golden handy-crates or plates in which lit camphor, 
fragrant incenses, vermilion powder, flowers to shower on the incomers are arranged, and those highways are 
well-decorated with throngs of people who are glee-faced at their king&#39;s re-entry, and into such an exhilarating city 
Ayodhya king Dasharatha and his retinue entered. </p>
<p class="tat">When the citizenry and city-dwelling Brahman-s have received him from a distance, that illustrious king 
Dasharatha followed by his phenomenal and praiseworthy sons then entered his happy house and home, which is like the 
lofty and lordly Himalayan palazzo. </p>
<p class="comment">&#39;King entered the house...&#39; is not just an entrance of a character into a scene, but it entails a lot 
of ceremony called <em>gR^iha pravesha </em>&#39;entering into householder-hood, the second stage of life <em>gaarhapatya 
dharma </em>out of the four stages of living, 1] celibate scholar, 2] householder, 3] repairing to forest or sageship, 
4] final release, moksha. <em>paaNi grahaNa anantarm kriyamaaNo gR^iha praveshaH - dk </em>where ceremonies go on for 
hours together.</p>
<p class="tat">In palace king Dasharatha is overjoyed when he is surrounded with his own inmates of palace-chambers, and 
when his long cherished ambitions have come true, while his queens, Kausalya, Sumitra, and slender waisted Kaikeyi and 
other wives are overjoyed in the functions of receiving the four brides. </p>
<p class="comment">Again this &#39;receiving bride&#39; is an elaborate variety of fun and games of womenfolk will take place, 
at which place there is almost no entry to men. For example, name telling. An Indian bride, or the later time wife is 
supposed to not to call her husband by his name. It is a sacred taboo, and her addressing shall be in genderless, 
person-less, and numberless hooting, cooing or calling like <em>e jii - o jii - emanDii - ennango - shuniye </em>so on. 
To cite one such ceremony it is &#39;naming game.&#39; Here the bride is compelled to tell the name of her husband, and she will 
be hesitating to do so, because of her newness to this house or to her husband. After some teasing attempts, she mutters 
her husband&#39;s name, and then only she will be admitted into certain chamber or room. But dwindling are these games, and 
dampening is that fun, in these days of readymade marriages. Then why Dasharatha shall be overjoyed at these womanly 
functions, they do all those womanish things... because, Dasharatha wanted his palace to be in festivity, with just one 
son. But four are forced on him and they too obtained four brides in one go, hence fourfold is his happiness. It may be 
observed that Kaikeyi is the lone queen with &#39;beauty&#39; as her attribute, and the problem with her is seeded here alone, 
saying that enchantment of Dasharatha towards her outweighs his affection to Rama, later.</p>
<p class="tat">Then the womenfolk of the king welcomed the highly propitious Seetha and the highly fortunate Urmila too, 
along with both the daughters of Kushadhvaja, namely Maandavi and Shrutakiirti, with pageantry and festivity. All of the 
brides and bridegrooms clad in silks promptly worshipped the gods in sanctums to the benedictory chanting of Vedic hymns 
and Ritual-fires, thus they shone forth like the tongues of Holy Fires of Vedic Altars. </p>
<p class="comment">These young couples by themselves are radiant, and they are now clad in radiant silks that glitter 
wavily like the tongues of fire, and the Ritual-fire s are already there flaring wavily, to the weave-like chanting of 
Vedic benedictions. With all these waving, flaring, glaring the couples too appeared as the humanly Ritual-fires before 
the wood burnt Vedic Ritual-fires.</p>
<p class="tat">Then all the princesses paid respects to all of the respectable ones, and they luxuriated in sequestered 
palace-chambers along with their husbands. </p>
<p class="comment">This &#39;paying respects to respectable elders&#39; is but one line. In reality, the torsos of those that 
pay respects will be put to test, because they have to &#39;pay&#39; by bending and touching the feet of elders, each time to 
each, <em>paada abhivandana, pai lagoo </em>. And if the girls are from jeans or pants culture, [because days have 
gone,] they will be fresh and new to bridal sari, which itself will be a weight to carry. And many times we see the 
young brides falling on the blessing couple because her bridal sari gets entangled in the toes of the bride, and she is 
not yet ready to manage it. So goes on this parade until their backs are broken.</p>
<p class="tat">And those best men among men, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, who are by now accomplished persons 
in weaponry and whose marriages have also come to pass, occupied themselves in the welfare of kingdom while assisting 
their father and moving around with good hearted people. Then after sometime that king Dasharatha, the legatee of 
Raghu-s, spoke to his and Kaikeyi&#39;s son, Bharata. </p>
<p class="tat">&quot;This is your maternal uncle and the son of king of Kekaya, and this valiant Yudhaajit came here to take 
you to Kekaya province, and he is staying behind because of your marriage...&quot; thus Dasharatha bade farewell to Bharata 
suggesting that Bharata may now go with Yudhaajit. </p>
<p class="tat">On hearing the opinion of Dasharatha, Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, then readied himself to travel along 
with Shatrughna to Kekaya province. That valiant and best one among men Bharata on asking leave from his father, from 
Rama, an uncomplicatedly dextrous one in undertaking deeds, and even from his mothers, Kaikeyi, Sumitra, and Kausalya, 
travelled on along with Shatrughna. Yudhaajit on clinching not only Bharata, but Shatrughna also, that valiant one is 
highly gladdened and entered his own city, indeed to the high rejoice of his father, King of Kekaya. </p>
<p class="tat">After the departure of Bharata, then the masterly proficient Rama along with Lakshmana started to square 
with the plans and programs of of his godly father for an ideal-sovereignty. </p>
<p class="tat">Rama keeping his father&#39;s directives in view undertook welfare activities for the people that are 
agreeable and even advantageous to them, and in the entirety of those activities, and he undertook activities to humour 
motherly affection with his mothers, and educational activities with educators, and in a highly self-disciplined manner 
he used to review them carefully from time to time. </p>
<p class="tat">That way Dasharatha is pleased with the deportment and comportment of Rama, likewise the Brahman-s and 
urbanites, and even all of the indwellers in the entire kingdom are pleased, and he who has high distinction, his 
truthfulness alone is his vantage point, and whose hallmarks are of higher degree, that Rama has manifested himself to 
those subjects in the kingdom, and even to all of the living beings in the world, as the Self-Created Brahma. </p>
<p class="tat">Also, that hearty Rama who permeated into the heart of Seetha is ensconced in Seetha&#39;s heart alone, and 
he disported for many seasons along with Seetha. </p>
<p class="comment">The other mms use <em>raamaH tu </em>instead of <em>raamaH ca
</em>where this <em>tu </em>says a difference. Then, &#39;Rama is busy in welfare and other works of state, <em>tu </em>
&#39;but&#39; he is also impassioned for Seetha. And he is <em>manasvii </em>&#39;hearty one&#39; warm, friendly, spirited etc., are his 
dispositions for kingdom, people, governmental works <em>tu </em>&#39;but&#39; he is that &#39;hearty&#39; for Seetha... Hence <em>tad 
gataH - tasyaam gataH </em>&#39;he pervaded her psyche, hence casketed in her heart... In the other mms it will be <em>
tasyaaH hR^idi nityam samarpitaH </em>&#39;heart of Seetha is &#39;always&#39; dedicated to Rama... and that word <em>nityam </em>
&#39;always, eternal, everlasting...&#39; couple. So, they may be a couple from time immemorial <em>tu </em>&#39;but&#39; they are as 
good as a fresh and fervent young couple... <em>bahuun R^ituun </em>&#39;for many, many seasons to come...&#39; he is disporting 
with Seetha. Why tell seasons when there is calculated calendar with years, decades, and centuries... Not so... their 
disporting is according to seasons, with seasonal environ, with a seasonable togetherness... <em>vijahaara </em>is 
grammatically a <em>parasmai padi </em>then the fruition goes to the subject, and subject of the verse is Rama, so he 
alone is the enjoyer and insatiate is his enjoyment with Seetha, even during and after
<em>bahuun R^ituun </em>many, and many seasons. <em>niravadhika paraspara baddha anuraaga abhivR^iddhi </em>&#39; an 
endless, mutual, conjugal, impassion and its enrichment - the self-content bliss of monogamy.</p>
<p class="tat">Seetha has become the beloved of Rama as she is wedded with the assent of his father Dasharatha, further 
Rama&#39;s love for Seetha burgeoned by virtue of Seetha&#39;s own virtues and loveliness. </p>
<p class="comment">Here the good old saying <em>ati ruupavatii siitaa - ati muurkhaaH ca raavaNa </em>&#39;Seetha is the 
greatest beauty, Ravana is the highest pigheaded demon...&#39; may be remembered. He loved her for his father&#39;s voice / Had 
given her and approved the choice: / He loved her for each charm she wore / And her sweet virtues more and more. - 
Griffith.</p>
<p class="tat">Even Rama as her husband made his mark in Seetha&#39;s heart twice as good, and they both used to clearly 
converse about their thoughts in their heart of hearts, just by their hearts. In her mien Seetha is identical with 
goddesses, and she is like personified Goddess Lakshmi, thus she is the reshaped Divine Prosperity, and as she hails 
from Holy Mithila she shall be held Holy, and since she is the daughter of Janaka, a loftiest sagacious and invincible 
king, she is sagely and stately, besides being shapely, and she with all these heaps of natural traits and 
characteristics, Seetha is rejoicing the heart of Rama. </p>
<p class="tat">When passionately conjugated with such a princess from the irreproachable king Janaka, Rama, the son of 
sagely king Dasharatha, has enthusiastically shone forth like the God of Gods and the Efficient Cause, namely Vishnu, 
when He is together with Goddess Lakshmi. </p>
<p class="comment">The &#39;son of king&#39; suggests that Rama as a prospective king has no paucity for any items of enjoyment. 
The best &#39;princess&#39; suggests that Seetha is no less than him, but now her prosperity edges on that of Rama, because she 
has Rama as her husband. And how will be their mutual affection and love? Many more pages can be written on it, but 
insufficiently, and perhaps inefficiently. This stanza from a romantic work <font color="#B3003A">maalatii maadhaviiyam </font>
will say how such a love would be: <em>liinena prati bimbite iva 
likhite utkiirNa ruupeva ca | pratyupteva ca vajra lepa ghaTite iva antar nikhaate iva ca | saa naH cetasi kiilitena vishikhaiH 
ceto bhuvaH pancabhiH | cintaa santati tantu jaalena nibiDa syuute iva lagnaa priyaa ||</em>my darling is immersed in my heart as sugar merges in milk, as the Red oleander reflects in a prism, as a portrait 
painted on canvas, as a picture carved on a stone tablet, as a gem studded in a ring, as bedaubed skin-cream, and as 
though the five darts of Love-god are nailed fixedly, [which darts usually will be in a touch-and-go fashion,] and as 
though stringed with thought-strings of my heartstrings, that are the halters with fastness...&#39;</p>
