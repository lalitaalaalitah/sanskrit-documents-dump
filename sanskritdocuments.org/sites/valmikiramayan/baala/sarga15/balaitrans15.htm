<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
King Dasharatha commences the <em>putrakaameSTi</em> ritual aiming to 
beget progeny, under the aegis of Sage Rishyasringa. The celestial beings gather to receive 
the oblations offered in the Horse Ritual conducted by King Dasharatha. They are perturbed 
at the atrocities of Ravana, and request Brahma to think for a way to eliminate Ravana. Vishnu 
arrives there and pacifies Brahma and other celestials with an assurance that he will incarnate 
as human to eliminate Ravana.</p>

<p class="comment">
Hindu mythology has no devils, but has only <em>raakshasa</em> -s, who can hardly be called 
demons, either. Not all the raakshasa-s are evil-doers. Some of the raakshasa-s are the fallen 
angels who take birth as mortals. They have their Vedic education, and they perform Vedic 
rituals and penance etc., thereby they get the patronage of any one of the gods among the 
Hindu Trinity, viz., Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. On attaining the cherished boons, they suddenly 
revolt against their own patron deities and commence the atrocities only to conquer the Heavens, 
knowing well that they cannot be attained with a mortal body. In order to snub the upsurge 
of such violence or the unnatural ascension to Heaven, the deity who gave the boons seeks 
the help of any of the other two of the Trinity. Then one from the Trinity will take birth 
as mortal, as an incarnation of god on earth. Usually Vishnu incarnates himself to eradicate 
the evils created by the intrepid <em>raakshasa</em>-s.</p>

<p class="comment">
Here the celestials bring in a preamble for Vishnu&#39;s incarnation as Rama and thus the topic 
of Ravana occurs in this chapter of Ramayana. Ravana need not be taken as an evil spirit, 
devil, hobgoblin or a monstrous being. He is said to be a Brahman well versed in all Vedas, 
musicologist, and a great king of Lanka, with unlimited riches, and very many of his clansmen 
with their vast dominions, and what not. Though Brahma and Shiva bless Ravana with boons, 
Ravana flouts all the norms in conquering Heavens in which course he did not hesitate to torture 
anyone who becomes his personal hurdle or hindrance. Hence it is inevitable for the Trinity 
to curb Ravana&#39;s atrocities, and Vishnu will now be requested by all the deities to incarnate 
himself on earth. As such, the expression of the word &quot;DEMON&quot; may not always be taken as an 
ugly and monstrous looking devil or Satan, as per the usual religious conceptualisation of 
evil.</p>

<p class="comment">
In Hinduism evil is not a separate entity from humans, but available in the same personification 
and resides along with virtue, like the two sides of a coin. These raakshasa-s are also mortals, 
extraordinary beings with extraordinary powers like god incarnates. But, with wickedness in 
their will, monstrosity in mind and a conqueror&#39;s ambition in their heart, they are rendered 
themselves as demons.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary deities 
of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary deities of 
universe. [1-15-8]</p>

<p class="comment">
There are eight functionary gods for cosmos in Hindu mythology that keep the cycle of natural 
law going. Each one is assigned with each of the eight sides of the universe along with a 
natural function. They are: 1] <em>Indra</em>, Heaven : East, 2] <em>agni</em> Fire-god : 
southeast, 3] <em>yama</em> Death-god : South, 4] <em>naiR^iti</em> Demon-god : southwest, 
5] <em>varuNa</em> Rain-god : west, 6] <em>vaayu</em> Air-god : Northwest, 7] <em>kubera</em> 
god of wealth management : North, 8] <em>iieshaana</em> god of bliss : Northeast. The governance 
of all these deities is Indra&#39;s function, since he is the presiding deity of Heaven.</p>

&quot;That invincible one is further self-conceited by the boons you have accorded, and he is overbearingly

the Brahmans. [1-15-9]</p>

<p class="comment">
The <em>sura</em> and <em>a-sura</em> nomenclature is the one that is commonly found in Vedic 
literature. <em>sura</em> is a celestial being and <em>asura</em> is its antonym, usually 
referred as a demon. Here it is not so because there are many <em>asura-s</em> who made their 
abode in heaven, like Rahu, Ketu, and others who attain salvation in this mortal life. Even 
Ravana came from Heaven, and returns there only at the end of the war with Rama. Thus <em>
a-sura-s</em> are not earthly demons but celestial beings of a kind like other demi-gods, 
namely <em>yaksha, gandharva, kinnara, kimpurusha</em> etc.</p>

<p class="comment">
Vishnu is a four handed deity. He handles a Divine Lotus suggesting that he is the creator
<em>sR^iSTi karta</em>. An ever-cycling disc called <em>sudarshana chakra</em> is handled 
symbolising his ever-lasting dynamism. He is the maintainer of that continuous dynamism of 
already created Universe <em>sthithi karta</em>. A mace called <em>kaumodakii</em> for bludgeoning 
enemies as he is the eradicator of evil <em>samhaara karta</em>, and a conch-shell called
<em>paanchajanya</em> which produces the sound of Om, listening to which salvation, <em>mukti</em>, 
is achieved by the true devotee. The sound of the same conch shell gives out an unbearable 
sound in respect of enemies. He is entered here without a lotus in hand. That means there 
is no need for a creation afresh. The other items he is handling are enough to deal with Ravana. 
If the Lotus is not handled that hand is taken as a blessing hand, <em>abhaya hasta</em>. 
And now he is giving that <em>a + bhaya</em> no fear, an assurance, to all gods.</p>

<p class="comment">
The expression that Vishnu has come on his eagle-vehicle has a cross-reference to the previous 
chapter&#39;s <em>garuDa yajna vedi</em> , Eagle-shaped Altar of Fire that is laid by priests 
of Dasharatha. It will be laid so with assumption that Garuda, also called <em>suparNa</em>, 
the Divine Eagle will fly in to transport oblations. The Vedic ritual is also called <em>su 
parNa</em>, the golden winged, or great winged vehicle to conduct oblations. And the eagle-vehicle 
of Vishnu is the quickest carrier of oblations to the deities specified in Vedic hymn. Here 
this Garuda has already carried the oblations offered by King Dasharatha to the chanting of 
Vedic hymns by Sage Rishyasringa to Vishnu. So Vishnu is now coming mounted on the same meritorious 
carrier, namely Garuda. Secondly the simile of Sun&#39;s coming mounted on a black cloud has some 
thing to do with yajna. A silver cloud is no value in giving rains. The rain has got an inseparable 
combination with Vedic ritual. Since the ritual of Dasharatha is going to fructify the rainfall 
is due on earth. Hence, the sun on collecting all the merits called the rituals of Dasharatha, 
in the form waters is coming riding on a black cloud to shower rains. Hence Vishnu and Sun 
both are ready now shower their graces. Vishnu will shower grace by eradicating the evil called 
Ravana, and the sun by showering the gratuitous and cooling rains.</p>

whose resplendence equals that of the sages, and oh, Vishnu, through the wives of such a king 
Dasharatha, who are in similitude with the <em>hrii</em>, the virtue, <em>shrii</em>, the 
affluence, and <em>kiirti</em>, the glory, you have a fourfold transformation and take birth 
as their son. [1-15-19, 20, 21a]</p>

<p class="comment">
These three <em>hrii, shrii, kiirti</em> are the daughters of Daksha Prajapati in their earlier 
births. The <em>hrii</em> is <em>hR^illekha</em> , virtuous disposition - which Queen Kausalya 
has, and who begot Rama. The <em>shrii</em> is <em>shriikaara</em> , the affluence of everything, 
which Queen Sumitra has, by which alone she magnificently and unhesitatingly advises her son 
Lakshmana to go along with Rama to woods. And the third, <em>kiirti</em>, the glory, and the 
glory of Kaika is well known. The position of this epic minus Kaika can be imagined, thereby 
her glory, may it be negative, that may be imagined.</p>

There is a great lot of discussion whether Vishnu made himself fourfold as Rama, Lakshmana, 
Bharata an Shatrughna, or he himself incarnated along with his main ingredients like conch 
shell, disc, mace as those three brothers. This verse says that he &#39;made himself, or agreed 
to make himself as fourfold.&#39; Even then, there are discussions that Rama is a &#39;full incarnation&#39;
<em>puurNa avataara</em> as the Supreme is indivisible - on one account. And his brothers 
cannot be reckoned as his incarnation  as they become parts of the whole but not the &#39;whole&#39; 
itself he did not divide himself  on the other account. And the tradition believes that Vishnu 
did not divide himself but incarnated in one piece, where his brothers are his paraphernalia. 
There is no unanimity on this, as yet.</p>
