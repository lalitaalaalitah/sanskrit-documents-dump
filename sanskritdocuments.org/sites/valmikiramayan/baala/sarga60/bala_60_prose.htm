<p class="txt">
Vishvamitra effectuates Trishanku&#39;s travel to heaven, but Indra throws him down 
as Trishanku has not acquired any merit to reach heaven. Vishvamitra enraged at 
this starts to replicate universe with constellation of stars and galaxies, and 
he proceeds to clone even gods. On seeing this chaotic situation, Indra with gods 
yield to the pertinence of Vishvamitra and allow that which Vishvamitra replicated 
to survive and also allow Trishanku to inhibit that pseudo Creation, but with an 
upside down posture.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;The great-resplendent Vishvamitra on knowing through his ascetic power about the 
ruination of the sons of Vashishta, along with Mahodaya, proclaimed this amidst 
the observance of sages.&quot; Sage Shataananda continued his narration of Trishanku&#39;s 
legend.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;This legatee of Ikshvaku dynasty is well-know as Trishanku, a righteous and benevolent 
one. He came under my shelter as he wishes to win over the heaven of gods with his 
own mortal body.&#39; So Vishvamitra started to speak to sages. You all scholars have 
to conduct Vedic-ritual along with in such a way as to how Trishnaku reaches the 
heaven of gods.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra advised the conductors of the ritual.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On listening the words of Vishvamitra all those great-sages have come together 
and quickly discussed among themselves about what is agreeable to righteousness, 
as they are the knowers of scruples of conducting Vedic-rituals, but such a ritual 
is desultory.&nbsp; &#39;Whatever Vishvamitra says let it be translated entirely and 
exhaustively into deeds called ritual. This Vishvamitra is the legatee of Sage Kushi, 
and indeed he is a saint similar to Ritual-fire besides being an extremely furious 
person. Otherwise this awesome sage gives curse, rancorously. &#39;As such, let the 
Vedic-ritual be conducted intending and enabling Trishanku, the legatee of Ikshvaku, 
to go to heaven by the ritualist prowess of Vishvamitra, therefor you conduct yourselves 
and you all preside over it.&#39; Thus, the officiators conceded among themselves.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Concluding thus those great-sages undertook concerned works of that Vedic-ritual 
and the great-resplendent Vishvamitra himself became its principal officiator. Those 
hymnodists who are the experts in hymnodies have scripturally carried out all ceremonies 
in a methodical way with inviolable hymnal methods, and as per Kalpa treatise, that 
lays down the rules for conducting such rituals.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;After a long time that highly ascetical Vishvamitra welcomed all the gods to receive 
their allotted oblations in that ritual. Then all of the gods who are invited to 
partake of the oblation have not come forward to receive their allotments, and then 
the great-saint Vishvamitra, obsessive with fury, furiously lifted up a wooden-oblational-scoop, 
and said this to Trishanku.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, ruler of people, now you shall see the potency of my ascesis which I personally 
achieved. Such as I am I shall lead you forth to haven with your own body just by 
my personal capability. Oh, king of people, now you will go to heaven with your 
own mortal body, which is otherwise unattainable. May it be a little, but there 
is some fruit of my ascesis, isn&#39;t it! Oh, king, you will journey to heaven with 
your own body owing to that prowess of my ascesis.&#39; Vishvamitra said so to Trishanku.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Once the sage Vishvamitra said those words, oh, Rama of Kakutstha, that king Trishanku 
soared to heaven with his mortal body, before the very eyes of other sages.&quot; Sage 
Shataananda continued. On seeing Trishanku&#39;s entry into the realm of heaven, Indra, 
the subjugator of demon Paaka, spoke this sentence together with all the multitudes 
of gods.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, Trishanku, you have not yet made heaven as your haunt, hence retrace your 
steps. As you are thrashed by the damning of your mentor Vashishta, you inane human, 
again fall down on earth, but with your head inversed. When Mahendra said so, Trishanku 
loudly exclaiming at the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra saying, &#39;save me, save 
me,&#39; and fell down from heaven. On hearing the exclamatory sentence of Trishanku 
who is shouting it loudly, Vishvamitra assumed an abnormal anger and also said, 
&#39;wait... wait...&#39;
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Like the other Creator that resplendent Vishvamitra, himself staying among sages, 
has replicated Southerly Ursa Major in southerly direction. And still remaining 
amidst of sages that highly reputed sage Vishvamitra further started to replicate 
the stereotyped stocks of stars sequentially, resorting to the southern hemisphere, 
as he is convulsed in anger at Indra.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Ursa Major is a prominent constellation in the northern sky, containing seven bright 
stars in a pattern variously called the Plough, the Big Dipper, or Charles&#39;s Wain. 
Also called Great Bear. In Latin it is, Ursa= greater (she-) bear. The Indian name 
to this is: <em>sapta R^ishi maNDala </em>Hence Vishvamitra adopted the opposite 
direction, namely southern direction, for his Creation, which shall be in direct 
opposition to the natural creation adopted by Almighty. From this point onwards, 
anything artificially or synthetically created, cloned, or replicated from natural 
item acquired the name of <em>vishvaamitra SR^iSTi </em>&#39;Vishvamitra&#39;s cloning,&#39; 
including the present day hybrids. Whether this Ursa Major like constellation is 
still available in southern hemisphere - is a point left to astronomers, or stargazers.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On replicating the stereotyped stocks of other galaxies and stars, and while fury 
continued to blemish him Vishvamitra said, &#39;I will now clone an alternative Indra, 
or let that realm created by me remain without any Indra,&#39; and when he is about 
to proceed to clone even gods in his wrath, the gods are startled. The gods are 
highly startled at Vishvamitra&#39;s creation, and they along with demons and with observances 
of hermits addressed the great-souled Vishvamitra with placatory words.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh great-fortunate Vishvamitra, this king Trishnaku is damned by his mentor, 
hence oh, ascetically wealthy sage, he is not at all eligible to go to heaven with 
his mortal body.&#39; So said gods to Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On hearing that sentence of those gods, the eminent saint Kaushika spoke this highly 
laudable sentence to all of the gods. &#39;Let safety betide you all. I have promised 
to this king Trishanku that he will ascend to heaven with his mortal body, and I 
am not interested to make it untrue.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Let there be eternal heaven to Trishanku with his mortal body. Next, as along 
as the worlds remain, let all of these stars and galaxies I have created also remain 
eternally in their places as my creation. It will be apt of you all gods to accede 
to this.&#39; So said Vishvamitra to gods.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When all the gods are addressed thus they replied the eminent saint Vishvamitra 
saying, &#39;so be it! Safe you be! Let all the created objects prevail in their respective 
places. Those amazing and numerous stars you have created will remain in firmament, 
but outside the path of stelliform of Cosmic Person. Trishanku will also remain 
in the circle of stars you created, but upside-down, for Indra&#39;s indict cannot be 
annulled, and he will be gleaming like a star and similar to any celestial. According 
to their wont to circumambulate someone who has gone to heavenly worlds, all the 
stars will suppliantly circumambulate this best king Trishanku, who has achieved 
his ends and who has become an acclaimed one with your tour de force.&#39; So said gods 
to Vishvamitra in deterring his further cloning of a simulative Universe.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Even the benign-souled Vishvamitra, when reverenced by all gods, that great- resplendent 
sage without stirring himself from among the sages said to all gods, &#39;Agreed!&#39;
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, best one among men Rama, later at the end of that ritual great-souled gods 
and ascetically wealthy sages went away as they have come. Thus Sage Shataananda 
continued the narration of the legend.&nbsp;

Trishanku - and his universe
</p>

<p class="comment">
Trishanku is the son of one Suuryaaruna and his original name is Satyavrat and this name Trishanku is 
his pseudonym. He got this because three sins are attached to him <font color="#B3003A">tri shanka-s</font> 
as said in another work Harivamsha. There it is said: <em>pituH shaapa aadi doShena | guru dogdhre vadhena 
ca | a-prokShito prayogaat ca | trividhaa tat vyatikramaH | evam triiNi asya shankuuni |</em> One by 
his father&#39;s damnation - when he misbehaved in his kingdom, his father being a righteous king exiles 
him to a wretched place. When his father was exiling him, Trishanku took umbrage at Vashishta, because 
Vashishta did not come to his rescue. The second blemish is due to the killing Vashishta&#39;s milch cow, 
knowingly. Trishanku kills that cow, when he did not get any food for the day to feed the son of Vishvamitra. 
At that time, he had to protect the wife and three sons of Vishvamitra, as Vishvamitra has gone away 
to a distant place for his ascesis, leaving his kingdom and family. Then Trishanku comes to the rescue 
of hs family. With that gratitude, now Vishvamitra tries to requite this king in sending him to heaven. 
The third damnation is for his usage of unsanctified meat of his kill. Thus, Trishanku is the one who 
carries &#39;three social blemishes&#39; on his head, and added to these is the curse of Vashishta, in making 
him as a profaner.</p>

<p class="comment">
Further, a god or teacher cannot be dragged to one&#39;s side or his wishful thinking, but they are to be 
attained or appeased with constant faith and servitude. <em>guroH aliika nirbandho na kartavyaH kadaacana 
| anumaanya prasaaH ca guru kruddho yudhiShTara | shiShyo gurau narashreShTa pratikuulam na sa~ncaret 
| viShNu puraaNa</em> And if god created the cosmos, a man trying to duplicating it, is as good as going 
against that writ of that god. Vishvamitra no doubt built many space stations and started cloning gods, 
leave alone earthly species, but he is forestalled, because he wanted to break the system from within, 
in which he is and by which he mastered all this expertise. It is as good as cutting the branch of a 
tree on which he is sitting. Absolute insolence is absolutely condemnable. Hence, Trishanku is still 
dangling upside down in his so-called heaven.</p>
