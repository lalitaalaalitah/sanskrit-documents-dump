<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties
<br>Sarga 61in Prose</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			The Legend of Shunashepa is commenced and Sage Shataananda continues 
			this as a part of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend. When Rama&#39;s grandparent 
			Ambariisha undertook a ritual, Indra impounds that ritual&#39;s horse. 
			Then Ambariisha had to fetch a human-animal in lieu of that lost 
			horse. When none is available one named Shunashepa, son of Sage 
			Riciika, and a nephew of Vishvamitra, offers himself with a barter 
			of riches to his parents.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, manly-tiger Rama, on giving farewell to those sages who came at his 
invitation and who have started to go back after the ritual of Trishanku is 
over, then that great-resplendent Vishvamitra spoke to all of the sages who are 
forest dwellers that remained with him.&quot; Thus Shatananda continued to narrate 
the legend of Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;While depending on this southern quarter this gross hindrance has cropped up 
for my ascesis in the shape of Trishanku&#39;s ascent to heaven, hence we will go to 
another direction, and there we continue ascesis. Oh, great-souled sages, we can 
conveniently undertake our ascesis in the vast of westerly direction where holy 
lakesides are there. That would be an august ascetical forest, isn&#39;t it.&#39; Thus 
Vishvamitra said to fellow sages in his camp.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On saying thus that most brilliant and great saint Vishvamitra performed an 
unhindered and rigorous ascesis subsisting only on fruits and tubers after 
reaching the lakeside of holy lakes. In the meanwhile the great king of Ayodhya, 
renowned as Ambariisha, embarked on to perform a Vedic-ritual. But Indra 
impounded the animal of the principal of that ritual, namely king Ambariisha, 
and when that animal is really vanished, the officiant Brahman of the ritual 
spoke this to that king. &#39;Oh, king, the animal you have fetched for the ritual 
has gone astray owing to your incautiousness. Oh, king, unguarded items of the 
ritual will themselves become destructive blemishes for that king who is 
performing the ritual. Oh, the best man among men, you have to make great amends 
for the loss of animal as that animal alone which was intended but now missing 
shall be used in ritual. Or, a man may be fetched as ritual-animal, and only 
after that the deeds of the ritual can be continued.&#39; Thus, the priests of the 
ritual said to king Ambariisha.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On hearing the words of his teacher, oh, the best one among men, Rama, he that 
highly rule-obedient king tried for a human-ritual-animal for a barter of 
thousands of cows. While that king is searching those and those provinces, 
villages, forests, townships, and even the pious hermitages, oh, dear Rama, the 
legatee of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, that king has indeed seen Sage Riciika, who is well 
settled on Mt. Bhrigutunga along with his sons and wife. On reverencing and on 
obtaining the grace of ascetically brilliant great Sage Riciika, and even on 
asking him about his wellbeing in every aspect, that kingly sage Ambariisha, who 
is with great resplendence and whose brilliance is illimitable, said this word 
to that sage.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, godlike sage, if you bargain your son with a hundred thousand cows for 
the purpose of a ritual-animal, oh, the successor Sage Bhrigu, I deem my ends 
are achieved. All the provinces are went over but unobtainable is that animal of 
the ritual, hence it will be apt of you to give me one son from among your sons, 
for a value.&#39; Thus, king Ambariisha bargained with the sage.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When that great-resplendent Sage Riciika is addressed thus, he said this word, 
&#39;oh, best of men, I cannot possibly sell my eldest son, in anyway.&#39; On hearing 
the words of Sage Riciika the mother of those great-souled sons spoke this word 
to the tigerly-man Ambariisha.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;The most reverential sage and the one from Bhaargava dynasty, my husband, said 
that the eldest son is un-sellable. Thereof oh, lord, you must know that my 
youngest son, namely Shunaka, is a cherished one for me. Therefore oh, king, I 
will not give my youngest son to you, either.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Generally eldest sons are fathers&#39; favourites, oh, best king among men, and 
mothers&#39; favourites are the youngest, isn&#39;t it! Therefor, I have to tend my 
youngest son.&#39; Thus, wife Sage Ruciika said to Ambariisha.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The wife of the Sage Ruciika is Satyavathi, the sister of Vishvamitra whose legend 
was narrated by Vishvamitra in Bala Ch. 34. This longing for youngest sons by a 
mother is reflected in Maha Bharata, where Kunti pleads for leaving Sahadeva, the 
youngest Pandava, from going to forest exile, along with her in the city. In <em>
sabhaa parva</em> she says: <em>sabhaa parvaaNi sahadevam prati kuntii vaakyam - sahadeva nivartasva nanu tvam 
asi me priyaH | shariiraat api maadreya maamatyakShiiH kuputravat | - aashrama vaase 
dharma putram prati kuntii vaakyam - sahadeva maaraaja maa pramaadam kR^ithaa | 
- dk</em> Kunti, the mother of Pandava-s says: &#39;oh, Sahadeva, you refrain 
from going on exile as you are a dear son of mine, though Maadri gave you a bodily 
birth, you are my favourite...&#39; Also, in the period of forest exile she says to 
Yudhishtar: &#39;oh, king, let no danger occur to Sahadeva... as he is my cherished 
son...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, when that sage&#39;s sentence is so, and his wife&#39;s sentence is also in 
that way only, their intermediate son, namely Shunashepa, personally spoke this 
sentence. Father said that the eldest son is un-sellable, mother also said the 
same about youngest one. Then I deem that the intermediary son is sellable. 
Hence, oh, prince, you may lead me forth.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, dextrous Rama, when that advocate of Veda-s, namely Shunashepa finished his 
speech, then the king gave gold, silver, and gemstones, each in ten million 
heaps, and even a hundred thousand cows, and oh, Rama, the legatee of Ragu, that 
king Ambariisha went away highly gladdened to take Shunashepa with him.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;That great resplendent and highly renowned king Ambariisha on his part 
proceeded hastily after ascending Shunashepa onto the chariot that hastily.&quot; 
Thus Sage Shataananda continued his narration.
