  <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p class="txt">
 Dasharatha arrives at Mithila and Janaka receives him reverentially, as he
          belongs to a crowning dynasty, called Ikshvaku-s. Then, after the usual exchange of royal
          pleasantries and protocol, all of them stay in Mithila comfortably.<br></p>

 <em>
 The fourfold army is generally taken as horses, elephants, chariots, and
  foot soldiers for the word <em>caturanga balam</em> , while some say such an army is moved only
  when a massive combat is necessary, but not when going to marriages. Thus some say though army is
  moved, it is as much as required. But this word also qualifies as <em>caturanga balam= dhana,
  kanaka, vastu, vaahana sampatti</em>, the quadruple opulence, namely 'riches, gold, equipage, and
  vehicles...' where opulence will be the only show in Indian marriages, either of poor or rich. R.
  C. Dutt comes near to this when telling in his poetic version: 'Ride in front with royal riches,
  gold and gems in bright array /</em></p>

 These formalities are still prevalent in marriage functions, in one way or the
  other, in India, esp. rural India. The bridegroom's party will be received at the outskirts of
  the bride's place, esp. if it were to be a village, then a small function / ceremony will be held
  laudatory to the bridegroom, and then they are invited into that place of bride like, 'meet a
  party halfway...' type protocol. This is other than <em>baraat</em> 'matrimonial
  pageantry...'</p>

  <p class="comment">
 Though Rama alone broke the bow of Shiva, both Rama and Lakshmana are said to
  have done it. This is a common unified laudation used for both of them, in view of their
  insuperable brotherhood, and such a sort of commingling both, for one person's action, can be
  heard often. For e.g., when Lakshmana misshapes Shuurpanakha, Rama is said to have done, and even
  both are said to have done that act.</p>

 There is controversy about the marriage of Seetha with Rama, insofar as its
  categorisation. Whether it is one of the eight kinds or not, is a debated point. The eight kinds
  of marriages are <em>braahma, daiva, praajaapatya, aarSa, asura, gandharva, raakshasa,
  paishaaca</em> and this topic can be discussed at a later time.</p>

 Usually the bridegroom's party will be stiff-necked at least till the marriage

 Epithets in Ramayana</p>
 

  <p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left">
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3" class="comment">'The epithets in
  Ramayana will be extremely boring and tediously repeated statements...' this is when we see at
  them in an overall superficial and lexical view. But, to the grammarians, prosodists,
  aestheticians, and the like, they are a head-breaking headache. A lot of verbal warfare is
  concurrently going on, perhaps even now, as to which belongs to which expression. To cite an
  example, here the verse 1-69-18 uses just <font color="#B3003A">raaghavau</font> 'a pair of
  Raghava-s...' for Rama and Lakshmana, and it is no uncommon term to them. But, here this word
  suddenly assumes a different dimension and aestheticians say that word means 'the pair of
  brothers who are the decorations, embellishments, and the like, of Raghu's dynasty....' because
  they dared the bow of Shiva to the extent of its breakage, and by their bold feat they are
  victorious medallists. While the ancestors in Raghu-s dynasty are pro-gods in seeking Ganga to
  come to earth etc., this boy Rama has gone against that God, in breaking Shiva's bow. Gita Press'
  English version puts this as 'the ornaments of Raghu's race...' and R. C. Dutt's poetic version
  has 'Honoured by the saintly Janak, greeted by his children bold / where the 'boldness' is as
  explained above. And this 'ornaments' or 'bold boys' or 'medallists' cannot be found in the
  verse, lexically.</font></p>

  <p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left">
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="3" class="comment">There are many
  who are baffled and bored at these boring and baffling overused epithets and there are
  enumerations also, as to how many are increased in Aranya Kanda compared to Ayodhya Kanda etc. In
  Aranya, for e.g., Seetha is variously called as Janaki, alias Vaidehi, alias Mithila... etc., and
  this chapter can throw some light, or make a difference between an alias and an epithet, on those
  that available in Aranya, as those epithets in Aranya bear a link with these few chapters. Even
  then, it will be inconclusive, as nowhere listed are these epithets or their allusions in their
  true colour. It is unclear for non-Sanskrit readers, even to vernacular Indians, to know as to
  how many epithets are truly and correctly translatable, without the assistance of ancient
  commentaries. Even in those commentaries, there are many epithets that are left out, as those
  commentators were more bothered to their own tenets like 'Rama is god... Rama is human... Rama is
  the dharma... Rama is Shiva...' etc., than these epithets. And we are presenting as far as we
  could muster up information about them. Hence, before the total extinction of Sanskrit
  grammarians and aestheticians, it is necessary to decode these epithets in Ramayana, thus we
  humbly feel.</font></p>
