<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Bala Kanda in Prose Sarga 8</h3>

<p class="tat">Dasharatha decides to perform an elaborate Vedic ritual, called Aswametha yajna, 
Horse Ritual, to beget children. He being a considerate king in taking conscience of the courtiers, 
he discusses this aspect with the Vedic scholars and ministers of his court, beforehand.<br>

<p class="verloc">.</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">To him, to such an effectual and virtuously great-souled King Dasharatha, , a 
dynasty-enriching son is not begotten though his heart is burning to beget children. To that 
anguished great-soul, a thought occurred this way, &quot;To beget sons, why should not I perform Horse 
ritual...and thus appease the gods in order to beget worthy sons...&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">That intellectual and a conscientious king having resolved with all of his sagacious 
ministers that such a Vedic ritual is performable, then addressed best ne among ministers, namely 
Sumantra, ‘ fetch all my teachers and clerics, quickly...’ </p>

<p class="tat">Then Sumantra gone quickly, for he in quickness is a dauntless one, and fetched all 
of the clerics like Suyajna, Vaama Deva, Jaabala, Kshyapa, and even Sage Vashishta, and also those 
other eminent Brahman that are Vedic scholars. Then on adoring them virtuous King Dasharatha spoke 
this impressible sentence that included justification and meaning. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;My mind is tumultuous without quietude for I have no sons... for that reason, I wish 
perform Aswametha, Vedic Horse Ritual... this is my thinking... therefore, I contemplate to perform 
that ritual as enshrined in the scriptures and as a rite-oriented one as well... let this 
contemplation of mine be well thought of... and as to how my desire to beget sons will be 
fulfilled...&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">Then the Brahman scholars along with Sage Vashishta and all other important 
personalities in their turn have blessed and honoured him, saying that &quot;splendid is this idea...&quot; 
thus, for that which is voiced by the king. All of them becoming happy have also said to King 
Dasharatha, &quot;let the paraphernalia be provided, and your ritual-horse be released... </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh, king, by all means you will beget sons as you desired, since you, to whom an 
upright thinking has suggested itself... let the ritual ground be arranged on the northern banks of 
River Sarayu...” So said the scholars. </p>

<p class="tat">Then King Dasharatha is gladdened on hearing the sayings of those Brahmans. And with 
happiness lurching on his eyes the king spoke to the ministers, &quot;As advised by my Vedic teachers let 
the paraphernalia be procured... On the northern banks of River Sarayu the ritual ground be 
arranged... and the Ritual-Horse be released monitored by capable warriors, along with the religious 
teachers...” So said the king. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Let peace invocations be prevailing and prospering, as ordained in the scriptures 
and tradition...if it is possible for the correct performance to obtain results of this ritual, and 
if it is possible to conduct this ritual without any difficult faults during its performance, then 
all the kings on earth would have performed it... Scholarly Brahma-demons will be hunting for the 
faults alone in the course of this ritual... should the procedure of this ritual be depraved of its 
set rules, the performer gets ruined... Therefore, you all shall see as to how this ritual of mine 
be conducted and concluded procedurally, and all of you are evidently experts in conducting such 
rituals... isn’t it! </p>

<p class="comment">Vedic Brahmans are to be very cautious and vigilant while performing the ritual 
in the order of ritual acts, faultless rendering of the Vedic hymns and other observant items of the 
Vedic canon. Should they by overconfidence or by negligence commit any mistake or fault, they take 
rebirth as Brahma-demons. After taking rebirth as such demons they, with their inherent jealousy and 
ire will always be hunting for such mistakes in other&#39;s ritual performances. If they cannot find 
one, they cause certain hindrances in that performance, so that the performer may commit mistakes 
and get ruined in the present life span and then take rebirth as Brahma-demon. Hence, every 
Vedic-ritual performer shall be vigilant.</p>

<p class="tat">On listening the words of the king all the ministers adored and assured him saying, 
‘It will be conducted faultlessly as has been conducted earlier...” On hearing those words of that 
best king, and what that is spoken earlier, then the virtue knowing Brahman scholars hailing that 
best king took leave of him and wentaway as they have come. Then on sending off those Brahman 
scholars, the king spoke this way to the ministers... “As advised by the Vedic scholars this ritual 
shall be conducted, procedurally...&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">Tha tigerly-king and highly intellectual Dasharatha, on saying thus to his ministers 
who are still in his audience, sent away those ministers also, and he entered his palace. And on 
approaching his wives, that best king&#39;s heartily dear ones, he said to them, “I am performing a 
Vedic ritual for the reason of begetting sons, and you all shall enter a vow...” </p>

<p class="tat">On hearing those words of the king, the lustrous countenances of the queens have 
become more gleaming, like the blooming lotuses after the clearance of dew-fall.</p>
