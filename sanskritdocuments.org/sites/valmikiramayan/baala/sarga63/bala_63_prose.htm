<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties
iSarga 63 n Prose </h3>

			<p class="txt">
			On Vishvamitra&#39;s performing severe ascesis Brahma accords the sageship 
			of &#39;Great-sage&#39; to him, whereas Vishvamitra&#39;s ambition is to acquire 
			the sageship of a &#39;Brahma-sage&#39; Absolute-sageship. In the meanwhile, 
			the celestial wench Menaka arrives at that place and Vishvamitra is 
			enticed by her beauty and spends some years with her. Later, on realising 
			the he should have won over lust, he further undertakes severe ascesis, 
			by which gods are perturbed.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When thousand years are completed in ascesis and when that great saint Vishvamitra 
took a bath of solemnity, all the gods have come forward wishing to accord the fruit 
of that ascesis to Vishvamitra.&quot; Thus Sage Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. 
The very highly resplendent Brahma spoke to him with highly palatable words, &#39;you 
have now become a kingly sage by virtue of auspicious deeds you have personally 
undertaken, let safeness betide you.&#39;
</p>

<p class="comment">
Vividly: &#39;so far, you are a king and by your auspicious deeds now you have become 
a &#39;kingly sage&#39; <em>raajaSi </em>and to attain a still higher <em>brahmarSi </em>
&#39;Absolute sageship&#39; you are not yet merited... as the Absolute sageship will be 
endowed to those who are above the negative traits of humans, like greed, anger, 
lust, jealousy etc.&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On speaking to Vishvamitra in that way Brahma returned to heaven, and that highly 
vigorous Vishvamitra again performed a great ascesis.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>vi </em>in the name of Vishvamitra is taken as the third syllable in 
Gayatri Hymn.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then at a long lost time Menaka, the prominent apsara, celestial wench, has arrived 
and started to swim for sport in that holy lake. That great resplendent sage Vishvamitra 
has seen Menaka who is incomparable in her mien and comparable to an electric-flash 
in a black-cloud, while she is swimming in the holy lake. On seeing her the sage 
having gone under the sway o Love-god said this to her, &#39;oh, apsara, you are welcome, 
I invite you to bide in my hermitage. Oblige me who am bewitched by Love-god for 
you. You be safe.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When he said thus to her, oh, Raghava, then she made a stopover there and ten years 
rolled by comfortably, and oh, gentle Rama, because of her staying Vishvamitra is 
indeed faced with a great hindrance in his ascesis. Then after the lapse of that 
ten year period Vishvamitra became doleful with distress and he is enwrapped in 
humiliation, as it were, and, oh, Rama, Raghu&#39;s legatee, then a resentful thought 
occurred to him.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;All this is the mischief of gods to defraud me of the great merit of my ascesis. 
Ten years have rolled by as if they are just a day and a night. Furthermore, I who 
am under the influence of lust and lure had to encounter this hindrance in my ascesis.&#39; 
Oh, Rama, that best saint suspired heavily when he became emotional with reparation. 
But on seeing the scared celestial wench Menaka, who is shivering and waiting with 
suppliantly adjoined palms, he sent her away with pleasant words, and he that Vishvamitra 
indeed went to the northern Himalayan mountain. He that highly celebrated sage who 
made a resolve to attain a sang-froid temperament and to vanquish lust, performed 
an unsurpassable ascesis on reaching the riverbank of River Kaushiki. Oh, Rama, 
while he reverently performed an unspeakable ascesis for a thousand years on the 
northern mountain, namely Himalayas, then fear occurred to gods.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;All gods coming together with assemblages of sages have approached Brahma and conveyed 
that, &#39;this Vishvamitra, the son of Kushika, may duly be given the epithet of &#39;Maharshi, 
Exalted Sage.&#39; On listening the advice of gods, Brahma, the Grandparent of all the 
worlds, spoke these pleasant words to the ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra. &#39;Oh, 
exalted sage, I welcome you my dear, as I am gladdened by your stern ascesis, oh, 
Kaushika, I bestow upon you the sublimity and supremacy among sages.&#39;
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;And on hearing the words of Brahma he that ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra became 
obeisant and replied the Grandparent adjoining his palms suppliantly.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;If your Godhead had said that I am a Brahma-sage, a sageship acquired personally 
by my pious deeds, rather than an exalted sage, then I would have become one who 
is really self-conquered.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra said to Brahma. Brahma then said to 
him, &#39;your senses remain unconquered as such, oh, tigerly sage, make an effort for 
it.&#39; Saying so Brahma went heavenward. While the gods who came here along with Brahma 
have returned, that great sage Vishvamitra undertook another round of ascesis by 
standing in levitation, upraising his arms, and subsisting on air alone.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;In summer he became the Five-Fire Ascetic, in rainy season open sky is his rooftop, 
and in winter water is his reclining bed even by day or by night, and thus that 
ascetically wealthy Vishvamitra indeed undertook a severe ascesis in this way, for 
another thousand years.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Five fires are four Fires in four directions and the fifth one is the scorching 
sun, overhead. An ascetic staying among these five fires will become an ascetic 
fire. The first word in first foot <em>dharme</em>, will also used as <em>gharme</em>, 
as above, in some mms.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;While that great saint is undertaking fervent ascesis it has become a very high 
burning problem to gods and even to Indra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then Indra along with all the assemblages of the Air-gods spoke to Rambha, the 
celestial wench, words that are advantageous to himself, but disadvantageous to 
the son of sage Kushi, namely Vishvamitra.&quot; Thus Sage Shataananda continued his 
narration.
