<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
On enquiring details about those dangerous demons that are ravaging sage&#39;s ritual, King Dasharatha 
refuses to send young Rama along with Sage Vishvamitra on many an account, and thus confronts 
the Sage&#39;s wrath.</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing what is spoken by Vishvamitra the tigerly-king Dasharatha became insensate for 
a time, and on redeeming senses he said this. [1-20-1]</p>

uuna ShoDasha varSho me raamo raajiiva lochanaH |<br>
na yuddha yogyataam asya pashyaami saha raaxasaiH || 1-20-2</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>2. raajiiva lochanaH</em> = lotus, eyed one; <em>me raamaH</em> = my, Rama; <em>uuna SoDasha 
varSaH</em> = is less than, sixteen, years [of age]; <em>asya raakshasaiH saha</em> = his, 
with, demons; <em>yuddha yogyataam</em> = warring, aptitude; <em>na pasyaami</em> = not, I 
see.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;&quot;Less than sixteen years of age is my lotus-eyed Rama, and I see no warring aptitude to him 
with the demons. [1-20-2]</p>

<p class="comment">
This particular statement <em>uuna SoDasha varshaH</em> less than sixteen years, has evoked 
a spate of commentaries in deciding the age of Rama at this juncture of going along with Sage 
Viswamitra, i.e., at the time of his marrying Seeta and at the time of his exile to forests 
etc. His age is said to be twelve years as of now. And this is confirmed by Mareecha while 
advising Ravana, that &#39;as a boy of twelve Rama, killed my mother and brother, and hit me out&#39; 
as at 3-38-6, <em>uuna dvaadasha varSaH</em> Or, <em>baalo dvaadasha varSo ayam</em> as per 
other versions of the same verse.</p>

<p class="comment">
Ramayana has some bearing on the number twelve. The Books or Kaanda-s are 6, half of twelve. 
The total verses are 24 thousand, two folds of twelve thousand. Rama is born in twelfth month. 
Vishvamitra&#39;s arrival, or better said as <em>Seetha kalyaNa</em> , Seetha&#39;s marriage with 
Rama, is in the twelfth year. His stay in Ayodhya before crown prince ceremony and exile is 
for twelve years. The years of Rama&#39;s exile are twelve, plus two years stay in Panchavati, 
of the total fourteen years of exile. In Uttara Ramayana Seetha&#39;s exile in the hermitage of 
Valmiki is for twelve years. So on...</p>

<p class="comment">
Some others said that because Rama has not yet attained all the sixteen phases like full moon, 
he is not a full-fledged person, <em>chaaru SoDasha kalaa sahitaH</em> Again in saying:
<em>raajiiva lochana</em> lotus-eyed one - petals of lotuses close down by night, so Rama&#39;s 
eyelids too close by night for a boyish sleep. Then how can such a boy war with night-active 
demons? In answer to this Sage Vishvamitra uses the same wording in previous chapter at 1-19-18,
<em>dasha raatram; raamam raajiiva locanam</em> where the wording <em>raajiiva locana</em> 
is used by Vishvamitra in the sense that the petals of a lotus spread out on the first rays 
of sun. So also the very opening of the lotus-petal eyelids of Rama will eradicate the nightly 
menace of demons with his Omniscient Sun-Moon-Fire eyes, <em>suurya chandra agni lochana</em> 
, that can see even in night.</p>

<p class="comment">
A Kshatriya of sixteen years age is unfit to war with any one, as he is still a childhood
<em>baala aashoDashaat varSaa</em> . But Rama is under sixteen, and he is being requisitioned 
for war. Can he combat even if he is under aged? Yes, he can, says Govindaraja as per the
<em>nyaya</em> /syndrome, <em>tejasaam hi na vayaH samiikshyate</em> &#39;dextrous person&#39;s age 
is not to be reckoned&#39; As such, though Rama appears to be under aged he can do wonders in 
eliminating the vice. This is again rounded off with Vishvamitra&#39;s wording in last chapter:
<em>aham vedmi mahaa aatmaanam raamam raajiiva locanam</em>.</p>
