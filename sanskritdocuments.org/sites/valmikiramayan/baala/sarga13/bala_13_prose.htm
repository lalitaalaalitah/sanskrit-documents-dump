<h3>Book I : Bala 
Kanda - The Youthful Majesties<br>Sarga 13 in Prose </h3>

<p class="txt">
King Dasharatha requests Sage Vashishta, the Royal Priest to commence works for the Vedic ritual. Sage 
Vashishta instructs all the concerned about the discipline to be observed in executing the works. Sage 
Vashishta also instructs the minister Sumantra to invite various kings of other countries, and those 
kings will be received with great hospitality. King Dasharatha along with his wives takes ritual vow 
and enters ritual hall.</p>

<p class="tat">
On completion of one full year another springtime arrived, and then Dasharatha a determined one to beget 
progeny by performing Horse Ritual entered the ritual hall.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The performer of such Vedic rituals has to perform preliminary rituals for a period of one year in order 
to attain eligibility to perform the final one. Here Dasharatha is said to have completed such preludes 
as he entering into the Vedic ritual hall in the springtime of the succeeding year to the one referred 
in last chapter.</p>

<p class="tat">
Greeting and even adoring the Sage Vashishta customarily Dasharatha said these very humble words to 
him.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Let my ritual be performed scripturally, oh eminent Brahman, let it be conducted in such a way that 
no obstacle occurs even in its ancillary functions. You being my very reverent royal priest are friendly 
and kind-hearted to me, and you alone shall shoulder the burden of the commenced ritual in all good 
faith and credence.&quot;
</p>

<p class="tat">
Then that reverent Brahman Vashishta said to king, &quot;Whatever that is requested or decided by you, I 
will see that all of them are materialised accordingly.&quot;
</p>

<p class="tat">
Then Sage Vashishta then summoned and spoke to elderly Brahman scholars, and elderly architects who 
are all proficient and elderly experts in conducting the construction of the ritual hall etc. Then summoned 
are the construction supervisors, brick-makers, carpenters, earth-diggers, accountants, and sculptors. 
So also the actors and dancers are summoned. Thus flawless scholars in scriptures and those men who 
are well read in Veda-s, are called and he addressed them saying, &quot;Performance of the ritual be organised 
by the order of the king. Bricks in many thousands be brought quickly and royal palaces as temporary 
guesthouses be built for the kingly guests, with very many facilities included in them.
</p>

<p class="comment">
A detailed description of the components of Vedic ritual hall is given at the endnote of next chapter, 
wherein King Dasharatha enters. Vedic ritual cannot be performed in ordinary households or in small 
temples. A very large place is selected, as per architectural science, and at its centre a <em>homa 
kund </em>, an altar of fire will be constructed. This area will not have any roofing so as to let the 
vapours of oblations of ghee, sandalwood paste and others offered into the fire of altar, get into the 
atmosphere and thereby to Heavens. Around this altar of fire, huge sheds will be constructed to accommodate 
thousands of participants and onlookers. Apart from this, mammoth kitchens and dining halls are to be 
constructed as all of the thousands of participants, who are to be fed as long as ritual is conducted. 
Some of the many tradesmen are listed in a bird&#39;s eye view as above.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Like that, for accommodating Brahmans hundreds of sanctified houses be built, well endowed and well 
established with very many eatables, foods, and potables. So also, accommodation is to be given for 
city dwellers too, in very spacious housing, and severally for the kings arriving from distant places.&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;For horses stables, reposing stalls for elephants, like that great billets for soldiers may be built 
for those foreign-country dwellers arriving in here on their horses and elephants along with their soldiers. 
These lodgings are to be arranged with many foods and utilities for the people of this city and for 
others coming from distant countries, and a very grand food be given in all of them.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Food is to be given dutifully treating all of them well but not just illusively, and the people of 
all the castes shall be well honoured as they would get their due respect, and no disrespect be shown, 
even when overcome by passion or anger at anyone. Exceptionally respectable are those men and architects 
that are preoccupied in the works of the ritual as they deserve, and those men involved in these works 
shall be well-treated with funds and food.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Thus, as to how all this be well organised without least negligence, thus you all shall administer 
in all your cooperation and good spirit.&quot; Thus Sage Vashishta spoke to the organisers.&quot;
</p>

<p class="tat">
Then all of them collectively replied to Sage Vashishta &quot;As desired, all the well ordered works will 
not be neglected in the least, and they will be done as ordered, and not the least of them will be slighted.&quot; 
So said the artisans to Sage Vashishta.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then on calling for Sumantra, Sage Vashishta said these words to him, &quot;Let all those kings of the earth 
that are righteous be invited, and let all the people from all the kingdoms, say Brahmans, Kshatriya-s, 
Vyasya-s, Shudra-s be invited in scores duly honouring them.&quot; So said Vashishta to Sumantra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;You personally invite Janaka the king of Mithila, a valiant one and an advocate of truth, honouring 
his well and duly bearing in mind that he is a long-time associate of our King Dasharatha, hence I am 
telling you in the first instance. Thus that King of Kaashi who is always a friendly, affectionate and 
a cordial one, indeed he shall be invited by you personally. Likewise, King of Kekaya, an elderly, very 
virtuous, and also the father-in-law of our Lion-King Dasharatha, you personally invite him along with 
his sons.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Romapada, the lord of Anga kingdom and the user of great bow, let that illustrious one be invited well 
honoured, for he is the friend of our lion-king Dasharatha. Like that King of Kosala namely Bhanumanta, 
and the King of Magadha, a brave one and a profound one in all scriptural knowledge, let them be honoured 
well and be invited.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;And Praaptijna, the king of Magadha, the kind-hearted and best one among kings, be well honoured and 
invited. Further, taking the orders of King Dasharatha and motivated by those orders, the kings of Sindhu, 
Sauviira and Sauraastra kingdoms may also be invited.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;All of the kings of southern kingdoms be invited, and should there be any other friends and other friendly 
kings on the surface of the earth, they too shall be invited as early as possible with all their followers, 
relatives through highly illustrious envoys, of course with the orders of our king.&quot; Thus Sage Vashishta 
said to minister Sumantra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing that word of Vashishta, Sumantra expeditiously ordered devout envoys to invite all those 
kings to their kingdom. That virtuous Sumantra became brisk upon sage&#39;s words and personally journeyed 
to fetch all the rulers on the earth.
</p>

<p class="tat">
All those artisans engaged in ritual works have reported Vashishta, the details of all those ritual 
works that are accomplished. Then, that satisfied saint and eminent Brahman Vashishta, spoke this way 
to all of them, &quot;nothing is to be endowed to anyone either with disrespect or deceptively, the deeds 
done with disrespect will kill the donor and there is no doubt about it.&quot;
</p>

<p class="tat">
Then in some days and nights many kings have arrived taking precious gems with them as gifts for Dasharatha. 
Then the well pleased Sage Vashishta said this to King Dasharatha &quot;the kings from distant kingdoms have 
arrived at your behest, oh, tigerly-man, and thse best kings are well honoured by me also as per their 
status.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;All the ritual works are also completed by the well coalescent men, thus you may start towards the 
ritual place that is nearby, to perform your ritual.&quot; Said Sage Vashishta to King Dasharatha. All the 
desirable paraphernalia is arranged and made available everywhere, and it is apt of you see ritual hall 
that is as though built by your mere wish.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Thus, on a good day while the ruling star of the day is favourable, King Dasharatha came forth towards 
the ritual hall according to the advice of both the sages Vashishta and Rishyasringa.
</p>

<p class="comment">
In undertaking of auspicious works, Hindus watch out for date, day, and the star of the day, called<em> 
tithi, vaara, nakshatra </em>in accordance with astrological import. In addition to these three are 
two more <em>yoga </em>and <em>karaNa </em>, which when added together this becomes <em>panchaanga</em>, 
five-aspects of time, which are essential to verify before conducting any auspicious work.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then Sage Vashishta and other eminent Brahmans keeping the Sage Rishyasringa ahead of them entered the 
ritual hall, to commence the ritual works thus. When all have entered the ritual hall as per canons 
and custom, that glorious king Dasharatha along with his wives undertook vow of ritual.
