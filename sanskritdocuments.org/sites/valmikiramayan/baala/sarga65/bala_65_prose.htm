			Vishvamitra becomes Brahma-sage after a prolonged ascesis that made 
			all the worlds to startle. All gods request Brahma to accord the 
			supreme Brahma-sageship on Vishvamitra as he is cleansed of all 
			mortal impurities, and Brahma accords that highest order on him. 
			Thus Sage Shataananda concludes his narration about the legend of 
			Vishvamitra.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;That great-saint Vishvamitra then leaving off the snowbound Himalayas on north, 
oh, Rama, he reached eastern quarter and undertook rigorous ascesis.&quot; Thus Sage 
Shataananda continued the legend of Vishvamitra. Committing himself to a vow of 
muteness, oh, Rama, he performed an unexcelled and unmatched ascesis which is 
highly impracticable for others to perform. Even on completing a thousand years, 
even when that great-saint became woodenly, even many barriers are at full 
blast, oh, Rama, fury has not entered his heart of hearts, for he stood fast in 
an unmitigated ascesis on making a firm determination.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On one day when those thousand years of ascesis with the rigorous pledge of 
Vishvamitra are being completed, and when he started to eat his meal, oh, Rama, 
best of Raghu&#39;s dynasty, Indra arrived there disguising himself as a Brahman and 
requested for the readily available meal.
</p>

<p class="comment">
This meal is prepared by Vishvamitra alone after a thousand years and such self-cooking 
of food by the ascetics is called, <em>vaishva devam</em>, since it is a sacred 
preparation <em>anena vaishvadeva ante samaagato atithiH svayam upoShyaa api sviiya anna pradaanena 
sambhojya iti suucitam - dk</em></p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then that godly Vishvamitra willingly gave away all the readied meal to that 
Brahman, and as no meal is leftover by Brahman-Indra, that great-ascetic 
Vishvamitra starved himself. Vishvamitra did not speak a little to the Brahman 
in dissent as he is abided by his pledge of muteness, and he again remained in 
muteness and breath-control. Like that, he indeed carried on his ascesis. That 
eminent saint remained without respiration for another thousand years, and then 
fumes have started to emit from the head of sage who is controlling his breath, 
by which fumes the triad of worlds looked as if it is searing, and this startled 
all the worlds. Then the gods, sages, gandharva-s, serpents, reptiles, demons 
are puzzled at the ascesis of Vishvamitra, and as their own resplendence is 
dulled by the ascesis of Vishvamitra, thereby they are marred by this blemish of 
lowered resplendence, then all of them addressed the Grandparent, Brahma.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Even if that great-saint Vishvamitra is angered and allured in order to foil 
his ascetical ascendancy, by all of us and by all means oh, god, he is 
transcending these lures, angers, and passions by his ascesis. Now, even an 
imperceptible imperfection does not really appear in him, but if his heartfelt 
desire is not meted out, he will devastate the triad of worlds with his ascetic 
power. All the directions are all tumultuous, all the oceans are tempestuous, 
and all the mountains are eruptive, and nothing is bright. The earth is highly 
tremulous, air is gusting turbulently, oh, Brahma, people tend to become 
non-theistic and we do not know what to do.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;All the beings in the triad of the worlds are very highly perturbed at their 
senses and they are as though stupefied, and when juxtaposed the sun is 
lustreless before the resplendence of that great sage. Oh, God, great saint 
Vishvamitra turned out to be the embodiment of Fire-god, and before that 
great-resplendent and most reverential sage makes up his mind for total 
destruction of all worlds he is to be placated.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;As to how the End-Time Fire entirely blazed away the triad of worlds 
previously, now this sage may do likewise, hence whatever is his predilection 
that may be given to him, even if he wants to become the potentate on the realm 
of gods.&#39; Thus, all gods appealed to Brahma&nbsp; Then all the assemblages of 
gods keeping the Grandparent Brahma in their forefront appeared before that 
great souled Vishvamitra and said this harmonious word.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot; &#39;Oh, Brahma-sage, you are welcome. We are much contented with your ascesis. 
Oh, Kaushika, you have achieved Bahaman-hood by your rigorous ascesis. Along 
with the assemblages of Marut-Wind-gods, I bestow upon you a long life. Let 
blissfulness betide you. You be safe. Oh, gentle sage, you may take leave as you 
please.&#39; Thus, Brahma said to Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On hearing the word of Grandparent Brahma and the other residents of heaven, 
and on paying good devoirs to all of them that great saint cheerfully said. If 
Brahman-hood and eternality have befallen on me, let the quintessence of AUM and 
vaSat syllables, and even all Veda-s patronise me. Oh, gods, he who is the 
outstanding one among the geniuses of kingcraft, and among the scholars of 
Veda-s as well, even that Vashishta, the brainchild of Brahma, shall acknowledge 
me in this way as Brahma-sage. Oh, the best gods, you may take leave if you can 
effectuate this ultimate yearning of mine.&#39; Thus Vishvamitra requested the gods.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Then the best one among meditators Vashishta has come over there when the gods 
besought him to come, and he made friendship with Vishvamitra. He also said in 
this way to Vishvamitra, &#39;you are a Brahma-sage. No doubt, you are a Brahma-sage 
and everything will accrue to you in accordance with the sublimity of this 
sageship,&#39; and when Vashishta said so to Vishvamitra, all the gods have gone 
away as they have come.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On getting his Brahman-hood even the virtue-souled Vishvamitra started to 
reverence the supreme among meditators and his counterpart Brahma-sage, namely 
Vashishta. When his aim is effectuated Vishvamitra ambled all over the earth 
abiding in ascesis, and oh, Rama, this great souled sage Vishvamitra achieved 
Brahman-hood in this way. Oh, Rama, he is the best saint, he is the embodiment 
of ascesis, he is always obliged with righteousness, and he is the stronghold 
for fortitude.&quot;
</p>

<p class="tat">
On narrating the legend of Vishvamitra in this way that best Brahman and 
great-resplendent Sage Shataananda took respite. And on listening the narration 
of Sage Shataananda said in the presence of Rama and Lakshmana, king Janaka said 
this sentence to Kushika&#39;s son, Vishvamitra, with suppliantly adjoined palms.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, eminent sage Vishvamitra, you happened to be here at this Vedic-ritual 
which is conducted by me, oh, Kaushika, that too, along with Rama and Lakshmana, 
the legatees of Kakutstha, thereby I am fortunate, I am much obliged. Oh, 
Brahman, I stand consecrated just by your graceful glance, and oh, great saint, 
I reckon that I have achieved many boons just glancing at you. Oh, 
great-resplendent Brahman, myself and the noble souled Rama have heard about 
your great ascesis when Sage Shataananda extolled it comprehensively.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;The congregationalists available in this Vedic-ritual congregation have also 
heard about your numerous endowments. Inestimable is your ascesis, infinite is 
your power, and oh, son of Kushika, your talents are everlastingly invaluable. 
Oh, lord, there is no contentment to me while listening to your wondrous 
narratives, but oh nobleman, time for vespertine ritual is fast approaching as 
sun&#39;s sphere is dangling westward. Oh, great-resplendent sage, it will be apt of 
you to see me tomorrow. Oh, best meditator, it will be apt of you to permit me 
to leave for now.&quot; Thus Janaka sought leave from Vishvamitra.
</p>

<p class="tat">
When he is spoken in that way, the best saint Vishvamitra is pleased at heart, 
and praising Janaka, who too is pleased to meet the sage, immediately bid 
farewell to the best one among men, namely Janaka. This way on saying to the 
best saint, the king of Mithila and the legatee of Videha lineage, immediately 
performed circumambulations along with his teachers and relatives to Vishvamitra 
in veneration.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Even that virtue souled Vishvamitra started towards his own camp along with Rama 
and Lakshmana, while being venerated by great sages who are available in the 
ritual-hall.
