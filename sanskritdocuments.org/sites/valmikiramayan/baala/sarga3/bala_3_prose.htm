<h3><b>Book I : 
Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties<br>Sarga 3 in Prose </b></h3>


<p class="txt">
The scheming of the composition of epic Ramayana is described here. Whole of the epic is rendered in 
its quintessence, as to how Sage Valmiki scheduled the narration of important milestones of the epic.</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing the essence of Ramayana from Sage Narada, which is abound with probity and prosperity, and 
a propitious one too, that virtue-souled Valmiki started searching for further known details in the 
legend of that dexterous Rama. Valmiki sitting on a sacred grass mat, whose apices are towards east, 
touched waters, and made his palms adjoined in reverence, and then by his yogic insight started to search 
comprehensively, for the narrative course of Ramayana.</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: Touching/sipping waters <em>aachamana, pariSechana </em>, before undertaking any auspicious 
work, including daily meal, is customary, because water cleanses the internal system, both mind and 
body.</p>

<p class="tat">
Of Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha, also of King Dasharatha and his wives, and what bechanced on Rama when 
he was in kingdom Ayodhya; Valmiki veritably discerned all that. Their smiles, their conversations, 
their deeds and the succession of events as well, all of them the sage saw wholly and clearly by the 
yogic power conferred by Brahma...</p>

<p class="tat">
Then, that which bechanced on truth-abiding Rama, while he is trekking in forests, with a lady being 
the third partner, where Lakshmana is the lone male aide, Valmiki visualized all that.</p>

<p class="tat">
Then that virtue-souled sage saw what all that has happened earlier, by his yogic exaltation, as though 
it is a citric fruit in his own palm.</p>

<p class="tat">
Discerning all of Ramayana in its actuality by his yogic prowess that highly intellectual Valmiki pioneered 
to author all of the legend of Rama, for Rama is a delighter of all in all worlds, and whose legend 
is abounding with the real functional qualities of earthly pleasures and prosperities, and which clearly 
elaborates the meaning of probity and its operative qualities, and thus this legend is like an ocean 
replete with such gems called thoughts, and an ear-pleasing legend, as well.</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: The pleasures and gains of the humans are <em>puruSaartha</em>-s, in its axiological meaning. 
Hindus have four such <em>puruSaartha </em>-s [namely human values,] <em>dharma </em>probity <em>artha
</em>prosperity, <em>kaama </em>pleasures, and finally <em>moksha </em>, blessedness. Of these four 
only the first three, <em>dharma, artha, kaama </em>are usually referred, and they are called <em>tri-varga
</em>. The final one <em>moksha </em>is not often quoted. Dhrama is the driving force. <em>chodanaa 
lakshaNaartho dharmaH </em>- Jaimini. Hence dharma is the prescribed conduct, either by scriptures or 
by the society, and it does not entail any merit or demerit, but just an obligatory conduct or duty 
or, say &#39;categorical imperative&#39; of Kant. And the other two, <em>artha, kaama </em>, are the means of 
dharma, and all leading to moksha. These two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are structured on 
these <em>puruSaartha </em>-s alone. Thus though Ramayana is abounding with the accounts of richness 
and glory of all kinds of wealth, which is secondary to human values, its main import is the virtuosity 
of human living. The ocean, though abounding with other less valuable items like conch shells, mother-of-pearl 
shells etc., its gems beneath all these peripherals are of high value. Thus this is an ear pleasing 
by its musical melody and heart pleasing by its meaningful wording. Further, it is pleasant for its 
import is in accordance with all the scriptures.</p>

<p class="tat">
That godly saint Valmiki composed the legend of Rama, the legatee of Raghu, exactly as the divine-soul 
Narada narrated it earlier. The birth of Rama as an incarnation of Vishnu, his very great valour, his 
gracefulness to all, his universal cordiality, perseverance, courteousness, and his truthful conduct, 
Valmiki described them all.</p>

<p class="tat">
Narrated are very many other amusing stories, Rama&#39;s breaking the great bow; his marriage with Janaki 
after with the help of Sage Vishvamitra. Dispute of Rama and Parashurama; the matchless merits of Rama, 
the son of Dasharatha; and the preparations for anointing of Rama as crown prince; Queen Kaikeyi&#39;s vicious 
intentions, are descrbed.</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama is <em>shrii raama </em>one who delights in <em>shrii </em>, where <em>shrii </em>is Goddess Lakshmi. 
Where as Parashurama delights in his axe <em>parashu </em>axe; and Balarama, the brother of Krishna 
delights in his own<em> bala </em>might.</p>

<p class="tat">
Disruption in royal unction of Raghava; his exile to forests; King Dasharatha&#39;s grief and bewailing, 
and thus his departing to other world; grief of the subjects of that kingdom; Rama&#39;s leaving them off; 
his conversing with tribal chief Guha; returning the charioteer Sumantra to kingdom from forests, leaving 
the trio at the banks of river Ganga, all these elements are well- described.</p>

on hearing the demise of his father; Bhararata&#39;s enthroning shoe-sandals of Rama; his living in a village 
Nandigrama; Rama&#39;s going to Dandaka forests; killing the demon named Viradha; Rama&#39;s visit to Sage Sarabhanga 
and Suteekshna; their visiting hermitic lady Anasuuya, and her smooth speaking with Seetha and also 
her giving a body cream to Seetha... by applying which cream Seetha will not wither away in the rough 
weather of woods, and these details are incorporated with great care.</p>

<p class="tat">

of Surpanakha, the demoness with Rama, and Lakshmana&#39;s defacing her, likewise.</p>

the wife of Vali and empress of that kingdom, and as consented Rama&#39;s stopover during the days of rain, 
are narrated.</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: This <em>raatri </em>usually means night. But it includes day also. When saying <em>triraatra, 
dasha raatra</em>, in conducting rituals it includes daytime also. On the whole it is total rainy season 
that is admirably narrated in Kishkindha Kanda.</p>

<p class="tat">
The wrath of Raghava, the lion, at the delay caused by Sugreeva, and Sugreeva&#39;s foregathering of all 
troops, and sending them to all quarters, and Sugreeva&#39;s description of earth&#39;s topography to monkey-troops.</p>

coming up from under waters to give rest to Hanuma, and Hanuma&#39;s seeing that mountain are depicted.</p>

<p class="tat">

which captures its prey by the shadow, and Hanuma&#39;s killing that Simhika, and his seeing the mountain

the coronation festival of Rama; disbandment of all military troops of monkeys; Rama&#39;s ruling his kingdom 
to the delight of his subjects, and the desolation of Vaidehi too, are described by Valmiki.</p>

<p class="tat">
The godly sage Valmiki composed the futuristic legend of Rama while Rama is on the surface of earth, 
and whatever that is there minutely, that is composed in all its minuteness, in the coming chapters 
of this epic.</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: In this verse, some take the word <em>uttare </em>as Uttara Ramayana, the events occurring 
after his crowning, Seetha&#39;s departure to forest, birth of Lava and Kusha, the sons of Rama and a battle 
between father and sons etc., are ascribed to Valmiki. But to some commentators, as per the format of 
this chapter, which surveys what Valmiki has scheduled to write, it is unacceptable since the word
<em>uttare </em>occurs for only one occasion, hence cannot mean next canto. Thus, they say, Uttara Ramayana 
cannot be ascribed to Valmiki. Hence the word <em>uttare </em>here is taken to mean henceforth, hereinafter 
of the epic.</p>

<h4>Thus, this is the 3rd chapter in Bala Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of India.
