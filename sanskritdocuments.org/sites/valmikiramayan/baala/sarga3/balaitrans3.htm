auspicious work, including daily meal, is customary, because water cleanses the internal system,

and prosperities, and which clearly elaborates the meaning of probity and its operative qualities, 
and thus this legend is like an ocean replete with such gems called thoughts, and an ear-pleasing 
legend, as well. [1-3-7, 8]</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: The pleasures and gains of the humans are <em>puruSaartha</em> -s, in its axiological 
meaning. Hindus have four such <em>puruSaartha</em> -s [namely human values,] <em>dharma</em> 
probity <em>artha</em> prosperity, <em>kaama</em> pleasures, and finally <em>moksha</em> , 
blessedness. Of these four only the first three, <em>dharma, artha, kaama</em> are usually 
referred, and they are called <em>tri-varga</em> . The final one <em>moksha</em> is not often 
quoted. Dhrama is the driving force. <em>chodanaa lakshaNaartho dharmaH</em> - Jaimini. Hence 
dharma is the prescribed conduct, either by scriptures or by the society, and it does not 
entail any merit or demerit, but just an obligatory conduct or duty or, say &#39;categorical imperative&#39; 
of Kant. And the other two, <em>artha, kaama</em> , are the means of dharma, and all leading 
to moksha. These two great epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are structured on these <em>puruSaartha</em> 
-s alone. Thus though Ramayana is abounding with the accounts of richness and glory of all 
kinds of wealth, which is secondary to human values, its main import is the virtuosity of 
human living. The ocean, though abounding with other less valuable items like conch shells, 
mother-of-pearl shells etc., its gems beneath all these peripherals are of high value. Thus 
this is an ear pleasing by its musical melody and heart pleasing by its meaningful wording. 
Further, it is pleasant for its import is in accordance with all the scriptures.</p>

Comment: In this verse, some take the word <em>uttare</em> as Uttara Ramayana, the events 
occurring after his crowning, Seetha&#39;s departure to forest, birth of Lava and Kusha, the sons 
of Rama and a battle between father and sons etc., are ascribed to Valmiki. But to some commentators, 
as per the format of this chapter, which surveys what Valmiki has scheduled to write, it is 
unacceptable since the word <em>uttare</em> occurs for only one occasion, hence cannot mean 
next canto. Thus, they say, Uttara Ramayana cannot be ascribed to Valmiki. Hence the word
<em>uttare</em> here is taken to mean henceforth, hereinafter of the epic.</p>
