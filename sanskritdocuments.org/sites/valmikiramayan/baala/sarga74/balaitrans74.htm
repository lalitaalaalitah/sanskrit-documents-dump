			Parashu Rama confronts the wedding party that is returning to Ayodhya from Mithila. On his very entry, the atmosphere 
			becomes pell-mell and a whirlwind ensues. Expecting some problem from this Parashu Rama, the sages like Vashishta 
			and others starts to receive him in a peaceable manner. Not caring anyone around Parashu Rama starts a dialogue 
			with Dasharatha Rama.</p>

<p class="comment">
It is customary to follow the wedding party up to the outskirts of village or town. In the meantime, there will be two or 
three hugs of mother and the bride, shedding two or three litres of tears, while the father of the bride secretly wipes 
his own moist eyes, and the like. Because, this despatch of the bride is considered as another life to her, for she cannot 
come to her father&#39;s house as and when she wants. Even if she comes, she has&nbsp; to return to 
her husband&#39;s place at some point 
of time, because from now onward &#39;that&#39; house has become &#39;her&#39; house. In this particular case of Seetha, she does not come 
to Mithila after this episode and even when Rama abandons her she goes into the womb of her mother, Mother Earth, but not 
to Mithila. So let us leave Janaka and his queen as they have the satisfaction in marrying their daughter, whose marriage 
itself is problematical so far, and when that has happened, now some sort of dissatisfaction has cropped up, in leaving 
her off with some forest ranger, called Rama.</p>

on earth, prior to Dasharatha Rama. The word <font color="#B3003A">parashu</font> &#39;an axe...&#39; is prefixed to this Rama because 
he wields a merciless axe. His father was sage Jamadagni and mother Renuka. This Jamadagni is the son of Sage Riciika, a 
Brahman, and he married Satyavati, the sister of Vishvamitra, a Kshatriya. On certain occasion Jamadagni doubting his wife 
Renuka&#39;s infidelity orders this Parashu Rama to behead her, which he promptly does, but Bhaargava Rama requests his father 
to bring her back to life. Sage Jamadagni agrees and brings her back to life. This is a kind of entrance test to Parashu 
Rama, and if he can ruthlessly kill his own mother he does not hesitate to kill any, in future.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3" class="comment">During their time, the kings were cruel and homicide was rampant to achieve the desires 
of the throne, however ruthless it might be. On another occasion when the sons of one Kaartviiryaarjuna sacrifice Sage Jamadagni 
as a sacrificial human, this Parashu Rama is frenziedly infuriated and starts eliminating all of the enthroned Kshatriya 
bloodlines on earth. That way he roves over the earth for thirty seven times eliminating Kshatriya-s. He even cuts off the 
foetuses in wombs of their queens, in order to stop the menacing progeny and offers the blood of the foetus as oblation. 
And that blood became five streams called <font color="#B3003A">shamanta pancaka</font>. Bhaargava or Parashu Rama practises 
insurmountable ascesis and appeases God Shiva, and thus acquires divine weaponry. He is indomitable in archery and nothing 
is unknown to him in the art of archery. Yet, he resorts to an axe to behead cruel kings, physically and personally, without 
depending up on a distant shooting arrow. He is <font color="#B3003A">ciranjiivi</font> &#39;long living being...&#39; Later when 
peace is established on earth, this Parashu Rama retires to penance but re-entered here to have a glimpse of Dasharatha 
Rama. And the purpose and import of his entry at this place, is recorded in later chapters.</font></p>
