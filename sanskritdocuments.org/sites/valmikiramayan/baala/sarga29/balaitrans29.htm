<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful Majesties</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 29<br>Verses converted to UTF-8 - Sep 2009</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama and Lakshmana inquisitively enquired into the Siddha aashrama, Accomplished 
Hermitage in the earlier chapter for which Sage Vishvamitra informs about the heritage 
of that hermitage for it once belonged to Vishnu in Vaamna incarnation. Vishvamitra 
narrates about it and how Vaamna, a dwarfish ascetic boy eradicated evil on earth. 
It is a suggestion to Rama from Sage Vishvamitra to do likewise in this incarnation 
of Rama also.</p>

<p class="comment">
This is firstly the hermitage of Vishnu before taking up Vaamna incarnation. Later 
the incarnate Vaamna also practised asceticism here. Thus, this hermitage belongs 
to both Vishnu and Vaamna, and on such an analogy this even belongs to Rama at the 
present time, so says Vishvamitra at 24th verse below.</p>

that hermitage is there, he has become renowned in all the three worlds for his 
magnanimity. [1-29-4b, 5]</p>

<p class="comment">
Bali is generally addressed Bali Chakravatri, Bali, The Emperor, for his grand benevolence. 
He is the grand son of Prahlaada, who in turn is the son of greatest demon king, 
HiraNyakashapa, who was eliminated by Vishnu, in His Nara-simha, Man-Lion incarnation.</p>

the boon giver and the eliminator of demon Madhu, namely Vishnu.&quot; Thus Vishvamitra 
is narrating to Rama. [1-29-10, 11]</p>

<p class="comment">
The ascetic practises conducted along with wife are said to yield best results, 
in the case of a desired object of that couple&#39;s interest. Therefore, Dasharatha 
also conducted the ritual to beget progeny along with his wives. Here Sage Kaashyapa 
conducted his austerities along with wife Aditi.</p>

hence oh god, arise from here to become my son.&#39; So said sage Kaashyapa to Vishnu. 
[1-29-18]</p>

<p class="comment">
The wording <em>siddhe karmaNi</em> is interpreted in two ways. One in respect of 
Vishnu who is practising asceticism there, as His austerities are accomplished here 
in accepting request of gods as well as that of Sage Kaashyapa. The other, in respect 
of Kaashyapa who is seeking the boon, and if Vishnu accords the boon to incarnate 
Himself as Vaamna in the womb of Aditi, the austerities of Kaashyapa are also accomplished. 
Since the deeds of Supreme God are not accomplished with mere austerities, but by 
eliminating the evil, the concept of <em>siddhe karmaNi</em> is appropriate in respect 
of Sage Kaashyapa. In any way, this hermitage is an Accomplished one for gods, for 
sages, and for Supreme Divinities, in taking a foothold to eliminate the evil on 
earth.</p>

&quot;That dwarf ascetic boy Vaamana begged and received a space that can be covered 
in three strides, but strode all the three worlds in those three steps for the purpose 
of saving worlds, as he is interested in the welfare of all the worlds. Vishnu gave 
the earth back to Indra restraining Emperor Bali with his vitality. Thus that great 
resplendent Vishnu made the three worlds to come under the control of Indra again. 
[1-29-20, 21]</p>

<p class="comment">
The myth is that Vaamna, the dwarfish ascetic boy, approaches Emperor Bali and begs 
of him for a space enough to place his three dwarfish foot-steps. While all around 
that ritual hall of Bali laugh at this boy&#39;s request, Bali comes to know who this 
dwarfish boy is. Though known to be Vishnu in this incarnation, without deviating 
from his vow of according charities in &#39;as is where is condition&#39;, Bali accords 
that much space to the boy. Then Vaamna places one dwarfish foot on this globe and 
the entire globe is covered with it. Vaamna then asks Bali where to put the second 
foot. Bali shows heavenward, which heavenly worlds are conquered by Bali and are 
under his control at that time. Vaamna places his second dwarfish foot on all the 
heavenly worlds covering all of them. Then again, Vaamna asks Bali as to where the 
third foot-space is. Bali shows his head to place the third foot. Vaamna places 
his foot on this third foot-space, i.e., on Bali&#39;s head and starts to trample him 
to <em>paataala loka</em>, nether worlds. At the time of donating the charity, while 
Bali is pouring water oblation into the hands of Vaamna, Sage Shukrachaarya, the 
demon&#39;s high priest, knowing this dwarf boy to be Vishnu, enters the nozzle of the 
water pot so that the donation water may not fall into the hands of the boy, thus 
to fail the donation. Knowing that the sage is in the nozzle of the water-pot, Vaamna 
pierces the nozzle with a straw of darbha, sacred grass-blade, thus piercing one 
eye of Sage Shukrachaarya. From then on, this sage has become one-eyed sage, symbolically 
meaning that he eyes on one side only, namely on the side of demon&#39;s welfare. Vaamna 
places his third step on the head of Emperor Bali and subjugates him to netherworlds, 
freeing the other worlds from his rule. However, Vishnu blesses Bali to be deathless, 
though subdued into netherworlds, and to become Indra in the coming manvantara-s, 
eras. Then on Vishnu is eulogised as Trivikrama, <em>tri vi krama</em> three, verily, 
paced - surpassing, one who surpasses all the three worlds in three strides.</p>
