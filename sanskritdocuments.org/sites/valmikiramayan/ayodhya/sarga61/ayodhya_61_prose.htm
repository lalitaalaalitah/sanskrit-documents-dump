<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 61</h3>
<p class="tat">Kausalya, while weeping, rebukes Dasaratha for his evil act of sending Rama to
exile. She explains various difficulties being faced by Rama, Lakshmana and Seetha in their
forest-life. She says that even if Rama returns to Ayodhya in the fifteenth year, he may not accept
the kingdom since enjoyed by Bharata.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat"> When Rama, who is excellent in virtue and outstanding
among those causing delight, having left for the forest, Kausalya who was feeling pained, spoke,
weeping to her husband as follows:  "Despite the fame in the three worlds of your great glory that
Dasaratha is compassionate, bountiful and kind in his words, how your two sons along with Seetha
who grew comfortably can bear suffering in the forest when faced with hardships, O the best among
the foremost of men! That Seetha, who</span> is a young lady in the
prime of her youth and very delicate, can really tolerate heat and cold? How the large-eyed Seetha
can eat a food prepared with wild rice, she</span> having eaten here a
good food containing soups and snacks? How that irreproachable Seetha can hear the horrid sounds of
cruel animals and lions, after hearing the auspicious sounds of singing and music here? Where Rama
the mighty hero, resplendent as Mahendra's standard and the mighty armed is sleeping indeed with
his arm as a pillow? When can I see the face of Rama with the colour of a lotus, framed with
marvelous locks of lotus-perfume, with eyes resembling lotus-petals and excellent? There is
no</span> doubt that my heart is fully made of the solid-interior of a
diamond, for which reason this heart is not shattered into a thousand pieces, even in my not seeing
of that Rama. It was not a kindly act by you that you banished my kith and kin, who were worthy of
comforts to wander around in the forest in such a miserable condition. Even if Rama comes back in
the fifteenth year, it cannot be inferred that Bharata will abandon the kingdom and the treasury.
There are those who in a ceremony in hour of dead relatives, first feed their relatives and
thereafter, to fulfill their duty, remember to invite the illustrious Twice-born. The virtuous and
the learned Brahmins</span>, who are like unto gods, do not accept
afterwards even food as delicious as ambrosia. The best of Brahmins in their wisdom, will not
accept what remains of the food of which other Brahmins have partaken, regarding it as a bull shorn
of its horns. O, king! Why not the eldest and the best brother refuse to accept the kingdom enjoyed
by the younger brother? A tiger does not wish to share</span> a
part</span>of</span> food eaten by another
animal. In the same manner, Rama the tiger among men may not accept that which has been enjoyed by
another. Oblations, clarified butter, leavings of an offering, sacred grass and sacrificial posts
made of trunk of Khadira tree, once used, are not put to use again in a sacrifice. Thus, Rama
cannot accept the kingdom taken away by other, as those not accepting an ambrosia whose essence has
been taken away or as in a sacrifice, stalks of Soma plant (from which a beverage called Soma is
prepared) are lost. Rama will not go through such a type of dishonour, as a strong tiger does not
endure even touching of its tail. Even if all the worlds combine together in a great battle, they
cannot stir up fear in him. The virtuous minded Rama will provide</span>
righteousness to the people with unrighteousness. Rama with great prowess and with his mighty arms
can surely burn up all beings and even the ocean itself by his golden arrows; like at the time of
destruction of the world. That excellent man with such a lion's strength and with eyes like those
of a bull was ruined indeed by his own father, like killing its child-fish by an adult fish. A son,
who is devoted to righteousness, has been sent to exile by you. Is it a right thing for you, as
seen by scriptures or is it an eternal conduct as practiced by the Twice born? O, king! A husband
is a chief refuge for a woman. Her second refuge is a son. The third refuge is her near-relative.
There is no fourth one here. Among those three refuges, you do not indeed exist. Rama on his part
took refuge in a forest and I do not wish to go there. Thus, I have been ruined in all ways, by
you. This kingdom along with neighboring states has</span> been ruined
by you. You yourself along with ministers have been ruined. I along with my son am ruined. Citizens
too are ruined. Your son Bharata and your wife Kaikeyi only are delighted."</p>
<p class="tat"> Hearing the aforesaid voice of Kausalya, consisting of her cruel words, the king
also being distressed became disillusioned. Thereafter, the king then looking back on his own evil
act, was entangled in grief.</p>
