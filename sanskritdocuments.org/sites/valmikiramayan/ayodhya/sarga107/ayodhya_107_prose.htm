<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 107</h3>


<p class="txt">Rama reveals to Bharata that Kaikey's marriage, stating that Dasaratha would confer
the kingdom as a marriage-dowry. Rama also adds that Kaikeyi also received the promise of two boons
from Dasaratha as a token of his pleasure and gratitude for the help Kaikeyi rendered during the
conflict long ago between gods and demons. Rama further informs Bharata that according to that
promise, Kaikeyi asked for the two boons, one for Bharata's throne and another for his own exile to
the forest. Rama requests Bharata to make Dasaratha's promises true and asks him to return to
Ayodhya and assume its ruler ship.</p>

<p class="tat">Thereafter, the illustrious Rama, highly respected among his fraternity, (as
follows) to Bharata who was speaking as aforesaid among his relatives. "These words, which you have
spoken are worthy of you, the son of Dasaratha the excellent king, born through Kaikeyi. O, My
brother! Long ago, when our father married your mother, he promised your maternal grandfather that
he would confer his kingdom as an exceptional marriage-dowry. Thereafter, in a conflict between
Gods and demons, your mother received the promise of two boons from the efficient lord of the
earth, King Dasaratha, as a token of his joy and gratitude."</p>
<p class="tat">"O, Tiger among men! Your illustrious mother of beautiful complexion consequently
demanded these two boons from that chief of men, for you the throne and for me the exile to the
forest. O, excellent among men! I too, have been enjoined by our aforesaid father to live here in
the forest for fourteen years, in accord with granting of boon."</p>
<p class="tat">"I as such, without any rival, have come to this lonely forest accompanied by
Lakshmana and Seetha in order to carry out the promise given by our father. You too ought,
likewise, to make our father, as a person having given a true promise, O Indra (the Lord of
Celestials) among kings, by getting yourself anointed to the crown without any delay.</p>
<p class="tat">"O, Bharata! For my sake relieve the mighty king from his vow and make both our
mother and father happy. "My dear brother! Formerly, an illustrious king named Gaya, while
performing a sacrifice in a place called Gaya in honour of his ancestors, chanted the following
verse: "Since a son delivers his father from a place of torment (hell) called 'Put', he is named as
'Putra'- 'he who delivers his ancestors from all dangers' To have many virtuous and learned sons is
to be desired, since one, atleast among them, who is intimately connected will come to Gaya to
perform a sacrifice."</p>
<p class="tat">"O, prince! This is the conviction of all the royal sages. O, the efficient and the
excellent of men! Therefore, save our father from hell. O, the valiant Bharata! Go to Ayodhya along
with Shatrughna and all the Brahmanas and give joy to the people there."</p>
<p class="tat">"O, King! I too, without delay, will proceed to Dandaka forest along with Seetha and
Lakshmana. O, Bharata! You become the Lord of men. I will become the emperor of the wild beasts of
the forest! Return now to the excellent city of Ayodhya full of joy and I also full of joy will
enter Dankada Forest!"</p>
<p class="tat">"O, Bharata! Let the (royal) white umbrella provide a cool shadow for your head,
repulsing the rays of sunlight. I will take shelter comfortably under the abundant shadow of these
forest-trees. O, Bharata! The wise Shatrughna is helpful to you. Lakshmana is known to be an
outstanding friend for me. We, the four excellent sons, will ultimately make the king true to his
promise. Do not get disappointed."</p>
