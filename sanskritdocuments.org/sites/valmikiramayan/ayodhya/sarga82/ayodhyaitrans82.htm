<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Vasishta requests Bharata to get himself anointed as a king. Bharata refuses to rob the throne from Rama. Who is really elighible for
it as the eldest son of the family. He resolves to bring back Rama from the forest and orders Sumantra to arrange for vehicles and men for the
journey. Thereupon, warriors merchants Shudras and Bhrahmanas harnessed their chariots and got ready for the journey to the forest along with
Bharata.</p>
