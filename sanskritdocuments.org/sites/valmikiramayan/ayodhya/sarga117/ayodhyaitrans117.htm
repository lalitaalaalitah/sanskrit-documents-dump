<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Rama, after due reflection, decides to leave Chitrakuta mountain because of many handicaps. Setting out his journey from Chitrakuta
mountain, he reaches the hermitage of Sage Atri and offers his salutation to him. Introducing his wife Anansuya as a great female ascetic to Rama,
Atri urges Rama to send his concert Seetha to Anasuya. Anasuya receives Seetha, who greeted her and gives her instructions on the role and
responsibilities of a devoted wife.</p>

<p class="comment">*We read in Puranas how sage Mandavya once pronounced a curse against a hermitess, Sandili by name, who was a friend of Anasuya
that she would be widowed one morning within the next ten days. The hermitess in her turn pronounced a counter-curse saying that there would be no
dawn any more. Alarmed at this, gods approached Anasuya, who by virtue of her asceticism converted the period of ten nights into one and in this way
averted the death of the hermittess, husband and accomplished the purpose of gods.</p>
