<h3 >Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 40</h3>
<p class="tat">The departure of Rama from Ayodhya for his exile is depicted. When they are
charioted through the streets of Ayodhya the citizenry wails and weeps for Rama's disposition. In
his unsurpassable affection towards Rama, King Dasharatha follows the chariot like a commoner, but
fails to go further and falls down.</p>
<p class="verloc"></p>
<p class="tat">Then, Rama Seetha and Lakshmana, who felt miserable, bowed down by touching the feet
of the king and went round him clockwise with joined palms. After taking leave of Dasaratha, Rama
who knew what is right and stood confounded by sorrow, bowed along with Seetha to Kausalya.
Immediately following his brother, Lakshmana too bowed to Kausalya, then clasped the feet of his
mother Sumitra. Smelling (as a token of affection) the head of Lakshmana mighty armed, who was
saluting her, his mother Sumitra who wished well of him, spoke weeping, to that son of her ( as
follows): "Highly fond of your kinsman Rama, you have been permitted (by me) to dwell in the
forest(with your eldest half-brother). Do not neglect your half-brother). Do not neglect your
half-brother Rama, who is going to the forest, my son! Whether in adversity or in riches, he alone
is refugee to you. It should become the code of conduct in the world, that younger brother should
be subject to the control of his elder brother. It is indeed a practice right from ancient times in
your race, to make gifts, to dedicate oneself to performance of sacrificial rites and to forsake
one's body to fight battles." Thus speaking to Lakshmana, who was in readiness to leave the forest
and who loved Rama dearly, Sumitra repeatedly said to him, "fare forth, fare forth! Know Rama to be
Dasaratha. Look upon Seetha the daughter of Janaka as myself. Consider the forest as Ayodhya and
depart happily, my son!" Then, Sumantra the humble man, who was aware of humility, joined his palms
and spoke these words to Rama even as Matali(charioteer of Indra) would to Indra (the ruler of
gods). "Mount the chariot, Oh the highly illustrious prince! May all be well with you! I shall take
you speedily, wherever you direct me to go. You have to reside in the forest for fourteen years.
Those years, as directed by the queen, are to be considered having commenced." Having adorned
herself, Seetha with her comely buttocks, mounted with a delighted mind, that chariot which was
shining like the sun. Thereafter, Rama and Lakshmana the brothers quickly mounted that chariot,
which was resplendent like fire and decked with gold. For Seetha who was accompanying with her
husband, Dasaratha gave away garments and jewellery, taking into consideration the period for which
she had to stay in the forest.</p>
<p class="tat">Even so for the two brothers, keeping the sets of weapon, an armor of hard make with
leather-cover in the midst of the chariot, Sumantra saw the three of whom Seetha constituted the
third mounted and quickly drove the horses which were highly admired, with their swiftness
resembling the velocity of wind. Rama after departing to the great forest for a long term,
unconsciousness prevailed in the city. There was faintness in the strength of people. The city( of
Ayodhya) is filled with flurry, with its elephants intoxicated in rut and highly excited and
resonant with tinkling of ornaments of horses. That city, including the youngsters and the old,
stricken with extreme agony, ran towards Rama alone, in the same way as the one afflicted with heat
of the sun rushes towards water. Having down towards sides and back of the chariot with their faces
turned towards Rama and with their faces filled with tears, all those people said with loud voices
to Sumantra thus: "Hold in the reins of the horses and go slowly and slowly, Oh charioteer! We
would behold the face of Rama, which would be henceforth difficult to behold for us. The heart of
Rama's mother(Kausalya) is surely and undoubtedly made of iron, since it does not get broken when
Rama resembling an offspring of gods is going to the forest. Seetha(the princess of Videha kingdom)
has done what ought to be done, by going along with him like a shadow, delighted in virtue as she
was and does not leave her husband in the same way as Mount Meru does not leave the effulgence of
sun. Oh, Lakshmana! You are attending ever to your brother who speaks affectionately and is equal
to the god. Ah, you are the accomplished of purpose! It is an immense fulfillment for you, it is a
tremendous good fortune for you, nay, it is even a means to heaven that you are following this
Rama".</p>
<p class="tat">Saying so, those people were not able to restrain their tears that come and followed
that Rama, their beloved delight of the Ikshvakus. Then, the king with the distressed mind, saying
that he would behold his beloved saw, came out of his palace surrounded by women who were too
dejected. In front of him was heard a huge noise of crying women, echoing like trumpeting of female
elephants when a lordly elephant has been pinioned. At that time, the father of Rama as is well
known as a glorious king Dasaratha(a scion of Kakutstha) looked shrunk, like the full moon
overshadowed by an eclipse. That glorious son of Dasaratha(Rama) of inconceivable courage, directed
the charioteer in the words "Let the chariot be driven fast." Rama commanded that charioteer with
the words "Move on!" The people said to him "stop!" Urged on the passage, the charioteer could not
do both. The dust raised on the road due to moving out of mighty armed Rama, was suppressed by the
falling tears of the citizens. With full of wailing tears, the citizens of after making loud cries
became unconscious with deep agony, at the time of departure of Rama. Tears born of anguish flowed
from the eyes of women like(drops of) water falling from lotuses by the commotion of fish. Seeing
the city with singleness of mind, the glorious monarch Dasaratha fell down with agony, like a tree
slain at its root. Thereafter, seeing the king becoming feeble and much distressed, the outcry of
the people rose from the rear of Rama. Some people crying "Oh, Rama!" and some other crying "Oh,
Rama's mother!", made the entire women in the gymnasium to weep. Looking back, Rama saw the king
sorrowful and perplexed in mind, as well as his mother following (him) on the road. Rama, bound by
the chord of righteousness, could not gaze openly at his parents, as a foal caught in a snare would
not properly look at its dam. Seeing them coming by foot, though worthy of a chariot, habituated to
comfort and unworthy of suffering, Rama commanded the charioteer with words: "Drive fast!"</p>
<p class="tat">Rama the tiger among men, feeling pained, as an elephant being pricked by a good,
indeed was not able to bear that plight of his father and his mother.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama's mother (Kausalya) ran towards her son, as a cow fond of her calf and whose
calf is tied (in a stall), runs home for her calf. Rama again and again saw that Kausalya, his
mother who was crying thus, running after that chariot as though dancing, shouting "Oh, Rama,  
Rama!" "Oh, Seetha!" and "Oh, Lakshmana!" trickling tears descending from her eyes for the sake of
Rama Lakshmana and Seetha. Dasaratha exclaimed saying "Stop!" while Rama called out "Go on,
proceed!" (In that way) Sumantra's mind became confused, as in between two (opposing) whirl pools.
Rama said to him: "You can say to the king that you did not hear (his call), even when scolded
(later). seeing their grief for a long time is quite unbearable." The charioteer, doing as per
Rama's words, took leave of those citizens and drive the horses more speedily even while they are
going. The king's people returned after (mentally) going round Rama. Their minds did not return.
Their impulse of tears also did not get reduced. The ministers spoke to king Dasaratha as follows:
"We should not follow to a long distance him whom we wish to see come back."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing their words, which were befitting with all virtues, the king Dasaratha felt
miserable, stopped short, gazing along with his wife, at his son Rama, with his whole body
perspiring and wearing a dejected look.</p>
