<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</b> <b>Sarga 42</h3>

<p class="txt">The dust raised by Rama's chariot having disappeared for a while, Dasaratha feels
dejected and fell insensible on ground. When Kaikeyi comes forward to support him he scolds and
asks her not to touch him. Kausalya then lifts him up and persuades him to return to their house.
His personal attendants take him to Kausalya's apartments and seeing him plunged in grief, Kausalya
seats herself beside him and began to lament in various ways.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - - -  </p>

<p class="tat">As long as the dust raised by the wheels of Rama's chariot could be seen, so
long did the king not withdraw his gaze from it. As long as the king was seeing his beloved son who
was exceedingly virtuous, so long did the dust in the earth appear to be rising for the purpose of
seeing his son. When the dust raised by Rama's chariot was no longer visible, the unfortunate king
afflicted by dejection, fell insensible on ground. When Dasaratha fell down, Kausalya his wife took
her place on his right side to lift him up and Kaikeyi of charming limbs took her place on his left
side. The king endowed with wisdom virtue and discretion seeing Kaikeyi beside him, said to her in
great agitation as follows: "Oh, wicked Kaikeyi! Do not touch my limbs. I do not wish to see you
.You are no longer my wife nor a relative. I am not of those who are dependent on you nor are they
anything to me. I discord you, by whom righteousness has been discarded and who are solely
interested in avariciousness. All that contract which I entered into by taking your hand and
circumbulating the sacred fire, I now renounce in this world and the next.  If Bharata feels
cheerful for having got this kingdom which is imperishable, let the obsequial rites performed to me
after my death do not reach me."</p>
<p class="tat">Meanwhile Kausalya the queen overwhelmed with grief, lifted up the king who
was covered with dust and returned to her house. The virtuous monarch, thinking deeply of his son
Rama, was so desolated as one who has slain a brahmin intentionally or as touching the fire by
hand. Turning again and again towards the track of the chariot, the countenance of the king in
grief lost its radiance like sun losing its radiance when swallowed by Rahu*.</p>
<p><span class="comment">*-Rahu- the inauspicious planet sent to swallow the sun at the time of
eclipse.</p>
<p class="tat">Afflicted by grief, thinking of his beloved son he lamented. Knowing that his son
reached the end of the city, he said as follows: "The marks of hooves of excellent horses which
carried away my child are seen on the way. But he the great souled one is not being seen. He who
slept on comfort on coverings sprinkled with the essence of sandalwood and refreshed by fans waved
over by him by the most deserving women, Rama the best of all my sons, will from now on , has to
take refuge at the foot of a tree somewhere, lying down on its trunk or rest on a stone. From today
the inhabitants of the forest will behold that long armed lord of the world, Rama, rising from the
ground and wandering around like an orphan. The daughter of Janaka, who was always accustomed to
comforts, will wander exhausted in the forest through the thorny undergrowth. Seetha who was not
earlier accustomed to woodlands, from now on will live in terror, hearing the roaring sound of wild
beasts, which was thundering . Oh, Kaikeyi! Let your desire be fulfilled! Dwell in the kingdom as a
widow. I do not indeed wish to survive without Rama the tiger among men. Thus lamenting, the king
surrounded by his people, entered Ayodhya the best of cities like entering a disastrous house by
one who has taken the funeral bath. Seeing the entire city with its road-junctions and mansions
deserted, its shops and temples closed, with its people exhausted with fatigue and plunged in
affliction; its highways not very crowded, the king entered his palace wailing and thinking of Rama
alone as the sun enters a cloud. Bereft of Rama Seetha and Lakshmana, the palace looked like a big
pool rendered unperturbed due to emptying of snakes in it by Garuda*"</p>
<p class="comment">*Garuda was a mythical bird (chief of feathered race, enemy of the serpent
race)</p>
<p class="tat">The lamenting monarch spoke in trembling accents and in soft, pitiful, indistinct
and not clearly intelligible words (as follows): "Take me quickly to the apartment of Kausalya the
mother of Rama. Nowhere else my heart will find solace." The attendants took the king who was
speaking as aforesaid, to Kausalya's house and there he was gently laid (on a coach). Having
entered Kausalya's apartment and even though laid on a coach, his heart became agitated. Bereft of
his two sons and his daughter-in-law also having deserted, the king saw that house devoid of charm
as a sky without a moon. Looking at that palace and lifting up his arm, the powerful monarch cried
in a loud voice, " Oh, Rama! You have left us both, your mother and I. Alas! Those jewels among men
who will survive the term of fourteen years, seeing Rama come back and embrace him, will be happy
indeed."</p>
<p class="tat">Thereupon, the night having fallen, the night resembling the hour of death to him,
Dasaratha spoke these words to Kausalya when the midnight struck : "Oh, Kausalya! My sight has
extinguished along with Rama and not returned. Even now, I am not able to see you properly. Touch
me with your hand." Perceiving that monarch on the coach absorbed in the thought of Rama alone,
Kausalya appeared very sad and sitting beside him, began to sigh and lament with a distressed
look.</p>
