<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 36</h3>


<p class="txt">In this chapter Dasaratha instructs Sumantra to take a detachment of the army
alongwith Rama to which Kaikeyi objects and insists on his being sent into exile without any
resources on the analogy of Asamanja, son of king's forefather.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - - -  </p>
<br>
<p class="tat">Then, Dasaratha the scion of Ikshvaku dynasty, squeezed by his own promise in the
matter of sending Rama to exile, Sighed heavily with tears and spoke the following words again and
again to Sumantra. "Oh, Sumantra! Let a military body consisting of (all) the four limbs of the
arms, filled with the best of its kind, be arranged immediately. Let courtesans well versed in
speaking and merchants with great riches having exposure for extension of sales bestow elegance to
the forces of the Prince. Appoint in this contingent those too, by giving abundant money to them
who were dependent on Rama and on whom he took delight in gallantry. Let important weapons, chiefs
of police and vehicles, hunters knowing the secrets of forest accompany Rama(scion of Kakutsa).
Killing deer and elephants, drinking forest-honey, seeing various rivers, he would not remember of
sovereignty. Let the granary and the treasury belonging to me be sent to Rama residing in the
uninhabited forest. He can spend his exile happily, by performing sacrificial rite in holy places
and disbursing appropriate gifts, along with sages living in the forest . The mighty armed Bharata
will rule Ayodhya. Let the glorious Rama be sent along with all objects of enjoyment"</p>
<p class="tat">While Dasaratha was speaking thus, fear drew near Kaikeyi. Her mouth too also got
parched. her voice also got choked. Feeling depressed and apprehensive, with her mouth getting
parched and her face turned towards the king, Kaikeyi spoke as follows: "Bharata will not accept
the kingdom, which will become uninhabited, hollow and which will be absolutely unenjoyable like
wine, quaffed of its spirituous part, Oh noble soul!" While Kaikeyi who has cast off her shame was
thus uttering the most cruel words, King Dasaratha spoke these words to that lady with large
eyes:"Having charged me with a burden, Oh hostile woman, why do you prick me while I am carrying
it? Why did you not check before(while asking the boons by putting a condition that Rama should not
be allowed to take anything with him) the deed(of sending troupes etc with Rama) in the beginning
itself, Oh the vulgar woman!"</p>
<p class="tat">Doubly enraged in hearing this angry question of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi the beautiful
woman replied to the king as follows: "In your dynasty itself, sagara cast away his eldest son
called Asamanja Rama too is entitled to go like wise (without anything to bank upon)" Spoken to as
above, king Dasaratha uttered only a word "Shame!". The entire people there were ashamed. But
Kaikeyi did not perceive it.</p>
<p class="tat">There, the aged and the upright chief minister siddhartha by name who was highly
esteemed by the king, spoke to Kaikeyi these words: "Asamanja the evil-minded, catching hold of
children playing in the street and throwing them in the waters of saryu river, took delight in it.
By watching him, all the citizens were angry and spoke to the king, "choose either to keep yourself
Asamanja alone or to preserve us, Oh the promoter of the state!" Thereupon the king said to them,
"For what reason is this fear?" Duly asked by the king, those people also replied these words: "He
obtains incomparable delight by throwing, through stupidity, our playing children in sarayu river
in a whirled state of mind." Hearing the words of those people, that king abandoned the son
repugnant to his subjects, in a bid to do good to them. Arranging immediately to place him along
with his wife together with the paraphernalia (like utensils, implements etc) in a vehicle, the
king instructed his persons thus: "He should be exiled for life." Roaming in all directions as
though he has done sinful deeds, he ransacked mountain passes, by taking a basket and a shovel. The
highly righteous King Sagara abandoned Asamanja for perpetration sinful deeds as above. But, what
sin Rama has done, for which he was debarred in this way? We do not indeed perceive any fault in
Rama. It is as difficult to find a taint in him as in a new moon. Or if you see any fault in Rama,
Oh Kaikeyi you tell about it now correctly. Then, Rama will be exiled. As it is contradictory to
righteousness to abandon one who is guilty and who is devoted to a good path, it would consume the
splendour of even Indra (the ruler of gods). Hence, there is no need of impeding the royal fortune
of Rama. Oh, lady with a charming face! Even blame from the public should be taken care of by
you."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing the words of Siddhartha, King Dasaratha spoke to Kaikeyi in the most
tiresome tone, with a voice choked with deep anguish, as follows: "Oh, the sinful being! Do you not
agree with these words of Siddhartha? By resorting to the path of the deplorable, you with a bad
behaviour, are not alive to my interests or to your own. Your action is deprived of a righteous
path. I am accompanying Rama now, by abandoning my kingdom, happiness and wealth. You enjoy the
kingdom for a long time, happily together with Bharata the King."</p>
