<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 15</h3>

<p class="tat">In this chapter, Sumantra enters the royal court and observes all the arrangements made 
for the coronation of Sri Rama. Ordered by Dasaratha to fetch Sri Rama, he enters the mighty building 
of Sri Rama.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - </p>

<p class="tat">Those brahmans skilled in Vedas stayed there all the night and arrived at a nearby place 
along with the royal priest, Vashishta. Ministers, army chiefs, prominent leaders of the city assembled 
there, welcoming the cause of Rama&#39;s coronation. The best of brahmanas were prepared to do Rama&#39;s coronation 
in day-time after the sun rises clearly at the arrival of Pushya star and on arrival of Rama&#39;s auspicious 
birth time of Cancer Golden water-pots, well-decorated throne and chariot covered well by shining tiger-skin 
were impressive. Water was brought from auspicious conjunction of rivers ganga and Yamuna, from other 
rivers, lakes, wells, ponds, from streams flowing eastwards, from streams which joined together and 
from oceans in all sides. Gold and silver pots filled with best water together with popped grain and 
covered by milky sapped leaves, lotuses and water-lilies were shining there. Honey, curd, clarified 
butter popped grain, sacred grass, flowers and milk were kept ready. Harlots adorned with all types 
of ornaments were also glimmering there. An excellent fly-flopper which was like spread-out rays of 
moon, made of gold, adorned with diamonds was kept ready for Rama. A white umbrella like circular moon, 
which was kept in advance for the occasion of coronation was also kept ready. A white bull, a white 
horse and a mighty and beautiful elephant fit to be mounted by kings were readily waiting. Eight auspicious 
virgins adorned with all types of ornaments, various types of musical instruments, panegyrists and others 
were also waiting. The people who gathered there after getting the things required as per orders of 
king for coronation ceremony to be held in a kingdom of Ikshhvaaku dynasty, could not sight the king 
and discussed among themselves about how to inform the king regarding their arrival. &quot; The king is not 
being seen. The sun has risen. Everything is ready for the coronation of Rama, the wise .&quot; Sumantra, 
who received good respect from Dasaratha, heard them thus speaking and addressed those kings, who came 
from different countries : &quot;.I am going to Rama now quickly as per king&#39;s directions. But, you are all 
worthy of worship by Dasaratha and by Rama in particular. I shall ask as your word about the well-being 
of king who is now awake and also about the reason of his not coming here.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">That Sumantra, knower of many ancient anecdotes , spoke thus, approached entrance of 
royal palace and entered the inner quarters which is always kept closed. He entered the inner quarters 
and praised the king&#39;s dynasty. He approached the royal bedroom and stood there at a distance.</p>

<p class="tat">He entered the bedroom, approached nearer to the curtain there and praised Dasaratha&#39;s 
qualities with blessings.: &quot;Oh, king Dasaratha! Let sun and the moon, guardians of the world like Shiva 
and Kubera, Varuna, Agni and Indra grant victory to you! Oh, the best of kings! The venerable night 
has gone. The auspicious day has come. Wake up and do whatever needs to be done thereafter. Oh, king 
Dasaratha ! Brahmanas, chiefs of armed forces and traders are waiting to see you. Please wake up.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Then, Dasaratha woke up and spoke these words to Sumantra, who was eulogising him, who 
was skilled in giving advice and who was his charioteer. &quot;Why have you not followed my orders even though 
you were asked by her to bring Rama.&quot; King Dasaratha ordered that charioteer there again thus - &quot; I 
am not sleeping. Bring Rama here soon&quot;.</p>

<p class="tat">He listened to king&#39;s words, bowed his head in salutation to him, thought for goodness 
of king, and came out of the king&#39;s palace.</p>

<p class="tat">That Sumantra with placid mind, went happily seeing the royal roads adorned with flags 
and banners. Sumantra heard the words pertaining to Rama and Rama&#39;s coronation spoken together by joyful 
people there. Then, Sumantra saw Rama&#39;s palace which was lovely, shining like top of a mountain and 
radiant like Indra&#39;s palace.</p>

<p class="tat">Rama&#39;s palace was beautiful with large doors and adorned with hundreds of raised quadrangular 
seats. There were festooned decorations over doorways with gems and corals. It was adorned with various 
precious stones and the best of garlands. Pearls were scattered all over abundantly. It was decorated 
with sandal and aloe woods, spreading out beautiful smells like the peak of a Darddura Mountain. Cranes 
and peacocks were singing sweetly. Figures of wolves and other art forms were sculptured here and there. 
It was attracting the eyes and minds of creatures by its brilliance. It was shining like a constellation 
of moon and the sun. It was full of various kinds of birds. It was as high as Meru mountain. Sumantra 
saw such a palace of Rama. People who came from different rural parts to see Rama&#39;s coronation were 
waiting with different gifts in their hands. That house decorated with various diamonds, was looking 
high like a great cloud. Hunch backed servants and servants of kirata tribe were moving all over the 
house.</p>

<p class="tat">That Sumantra with chariot fastened with horses and having a top, approached towards 
Rama&#39;s palace, irradiating the overcrowded main road and gladdening the hearts of all citizens. That 
palace of the great souled Rama was like Indra&#39;s palace with great wealth. It was filled with various 
deers and peacocks. After approaching that palace, he became quite thrilled. The inner apartments of 
Rama&#39;s palace were well decorated, high as Kailasa mountain and like abodes of deities. Sumantra entered 
there, passed over many of Rama&#39;s friends who were well wishers and approached Rama&#39;s inner apartment.</p>

<p class="tat">There, Sumantra heard delightful people talking about Rama&#39;s coronation and the rites 
to be performed for the sake of Rama&#39;s prosperity.</p>

<p class="tat">Sumantra saw the beautiful palace of Rama which was as high as top of the Meru mountain, 
shining with radiance. The mansion was filled with birds and antelopes. It was like Indra&#39;s mansion. 
He saw crores and millions of rural folk and other people with folded hands approaching the area leaving 
their respective vehicles. There he saw a beautiful elephant called Satrunjaya with highly elevated 
body and as Rama&#39;s royal conveyance. It was like a great cloud and a mountain. It was in a rut, uncontrollable 
by goad and capable of conquering the enemy.</p>

<p class="tat">The ministers in chief who were beloved to the king, were well-adorned and came there 
on horse-carriages and elephants. Sumantra passed over the people gathered there on all sides and entered 
the rich inner apartment.</p>

<p class="tat">Then, that Sumantra entered Rama&#39;s palace, which was like top of a mountain, like an 
unmoving cloud, which contained mansions resembling excellent aerial cars--even as a crocodile entering 
the ocean containing a number of precious stones. Nobody obstructed him.</p>
