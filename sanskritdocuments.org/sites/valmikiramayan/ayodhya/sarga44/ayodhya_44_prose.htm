<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 44</h3>

<p class="txt">Establishing the greatness of Rama, Sumitra of gracious speech, assuages Kausalya's
grief.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - - -  </p>

<p class="tat">Sumitra, who was devoted to righteousness spoke the following words, which were
virtuous, to the celebrated Kausalya, the foremost among women, who had been wailing as aforesaid 
"That son of yours, Oh the venerable one, is endowed with excellent virtues and is the foremost
among men. What is the use in your lamenting in this way or in weeping piteously? Your son is
having mighty strength. He proved his high- soled father perfectly truthful by renouncing his
throne. He stood firmly in righteousness, which is always practiced perfectly by disciples and
which gives fruits even after death. That Rama, the most excellent man, never deserves to be
lamented. Lakshmana, the faultless man and the compassionate man towards all beings, always renders
the best form of service to Rama. His conduct is beneficial to the high-soled Rama. Sita, who was
habituated to comforts, even after knowing the pain whatsoever, is accompanying your virtuous-
soled son. What has not been secured by your capable son, who is rich in virtue and is engrossed in
the vow of truthfulness, and the banner of whose fame flutters though out the world?  Having known
the purity and magnanimity of Rama , the sun assuredly will not be able to torment Rama's body with
his rays. Auspicious and delightful breeze of moderate heat and cold, blowing from woods at all
times , will render service to Rama. Gently touching with its cool rays when he is reposing at
night and embracing him like a father, the moon will refresh Rama. Formerly, when Rama killed
Subahu the son of Sambarasura the chief of demons, Brahma being delighted , gave celestial weapons
to Rama, the man with great splendor. Rama the hero and the tiger among men, relying on the
strength of his own arms, will dwell fearlessly in the forest as if in his own palace. How can
earth cannot be under the command of Rama, to whose aim of arrows, the enemies fall an easy prey?
The splendor endowed with Rama, the valor that is in him and the beneficent strength that resides
in him lead one to believe that when he completes the term of his exile in the forest, he will
speedily regain his kingdom. Rama is the illuminator of even the sun, fire of fire, the ruler of
rules, the splendor of splendor, the foremost glory of glory, the forbearance of forbearance, the
god of gods and the foremost being of all the beings. Indeed, what handicaps are there for him in
the forest or in Ayodhya? Rama the best among men will be installed on the throne soon along with
the Mother Earth (the consort of lord Vishnu), Sita the princess of Videha kingdom and Lakshmi (
the goddess of fortune another consort of Vishnu) Seeing Rama departing, all the people in Ayodhya
smitten as they were with upsurge of grief shed tears born of agony. The goddess of fortune as Sita
followed the invincible hero even as he departed for the forest, clad in a garment of the sacred
Kusa grass. Indeed, what can be difficult for him to obtain? What can be difficult to obtain for,
to whose front indeed walks Lakshmana himself the best among the holders of bow wielding arrows,
sword and missiles? Oh, Kausalya! I tell you the truth : you can see Rama coming back, on having
completed the term of his exile in the forest . Abandon grief and infatuation. You will be able to
see your son, like the rising moon, saluting respectfully your feet, by bowing his head. Seeing
Rama shining with great splendor appearing before you again, having been coroneted, you will be
shedding soon tears of joy from your eyes. Do not have uneasiness or grief. Rama has no ill luck.
You will be able to see soon your son along with Sita, accompanied by Lakshmana. While people are
to be consoled by you at this moment, why are you fostering grief in your heart? You, whose son is
Rama, ought not to grieve, for none is established in right path in the world than Rama. Seeing
your son saluting with his friends, you will at once begin to shed tears, like a line of clouds in
a rainy season. Your son the bestower of boons, will soon return to Ayodhya, and touch your feet
with his gentle but muscular hands. When your son the hero along with his friends salute you
respectfully in adoration, you will sprinkle tears of joy in the same way as a line of clouds pour
rain on the mountain."</p>
<p class="tat">Sumitra the queen, skilled in her employment of words, who is faultless and
charming, thus consoled Rama's mother with various words and finally stopped speaking. Hearing
those words of Sumitra the mother of Lakshmana, the agony of Kausalya Rama's mother and the wife of
Dasaratha quickly disappeared in the same way as an autumnal cloud with a little water in it
disappears quickly.</p>

the work of a sage and the oldest epic.</h4>
