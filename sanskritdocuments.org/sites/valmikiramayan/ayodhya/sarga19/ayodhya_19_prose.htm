<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 19</h3>
<p class="tat"> Rama on hearing the harsh and cruel words of Kaikeyi remains unruffled. He asks
Kaikeyi sorrowfuly about the reason the king did not speak to him directly about the matter. He
then immediately decides to leave for forest after duly saluting the king and Kaikeyi. On the way
to forest he desires to visit his mother and Sita and inform them of his decision.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - - </p>
<p class="tat">Rama the annihilator of enemies heard those harsh and deadly words but was
unruffled. He spoke these words to Kaikeyi:  "Let it be, as you said it. I shall fulfil the king's
promise, go to the forest from here to reside there, wearing braided hair and covered with a hide.
But I want to know why the king, the inviolable and the subduer of enemies, is not greeting me
today as before. Oh, queen! you need not be indignant. I am telling before you that I shall go to
the forest, wearing rags and braided hair. Become delighted  as well. How can I not do faithfully
an action dear to my father, as commanded by him as well-wisher, venerable man, as person with
right conduct and as king. My heart is burning indeed with one sorrowful feeling that king himself
has not directly informed me about Bharata's coronation. Without being asked, I myself would have
gladly offered even Sita with kingdom, even my life, loved ones and wealth. Being directed by king,
who is my father himself, how much more should I tell that I can give everything to Bharata, duly
obeying father's promise to fulfil your beloved desire. That is why, you console him. Why indeed
the king is thus slowly shedding tears, with eyes gazed upon the floor? Let messengers go now
itself on fleet horses to bring Bharata from maternal uncle's house as per orders of the king.
Immedi glad that he would certainly go and urged him to make haste at once.ately, I shall go to
live in forest of Dandaka for fourteen years, without reflecting on whether my father's words are
right or wrong."                                                                                   
                                                                    </p>
<p class="tat">Hearing Rama's words, Kaikeyi felt happy the reply received from Rama. Confident of
Rama's departure to the forest, he urged him as follows: "Let it be so. Messengers can go on horses
having rapid speed, to bring back Bharata from his maternal uncle's house. But I think it is not
quite appropriate for you who are enthusiastic to go to forest, to delay further. It is nothing but
shyness that the king is not able to speak to you. Oh Rama, the best of men! Do not worry about it.
Oh, Rama! Your father will neither take his bath nor eat a meal until you leave the city for the
forest immediately.</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing these words, the king saying "what a pity! How much misery!" was overwhelmed
with sorrow, fainted and fell in that couch adorned with gold. Rama lifted up the king and soon got
hurried up to leave for the forest  that which he was again instigated by Kaikeyi as a horse was
hit by a whip.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama after hearing that vulgar woman's words, which were harsh and poignant, was
unruffled and spoke these words to Kaikeyi:  "Oh queen! I am not concerned with wealth. However, I
am eager to receive the world hospitably. Know me as equal to a sage, abiding in righteousness
alone. If I have to do whatever action is dearer to my revered father, that action is just done in
all respects even by renouncing life. There is not indeed anything of greater performance of duty
than doing service to father or than doing what he commands. Even if our reverent father does not
tell me, I shall reside in the forest, devoid of people, now for fourteen years as per your word.
In the matter of coronation of Bharata, you told Dasaratha and not to me, even though you had every
authority to tell me directly. By this, it is known that you have not seen any merit in me. It is
certain! Today itself, I shall go to the forest of Dandaka after bidding farewell to my mother and
also after consoling Sita. While ruling the kingdom, see that Bharata serves our father well. It is
indeed an age-old practice."</p>
<p class="tat">Dasaratha after hearing Rama's words was hurt very much with grief, was unable to
talk and wept loudly.</p>
<p class="tat">That Rama, with great brilliance, came out, after duly offering obeisance to the
feet of his father who was fainted and also to the feet of that vulgar Kaikeyi. Rama made
circumambulatory salutation to his father as well as Kaikeyiand coming out of that palace, saw his
friends(standing at the gate).</p>
<p class="tat">Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, felt very angry with his eyes filled with tears and
accompanied behind Rama. Rama moved clockwise around the auspicious materials collected for the
propound coronation and having fixed his attention respectfully on them, moved away slowly.</p>
<p class="tat">As Rama was a pleasing personality, he was loved by all the people. The loss of
kingdom could not diminish such a great splendour of  Rama as a night cannot diminish the splendour
of the moon. In that Rama, who was leaving the kingdom after having decided to go to the forest,
there was no perturbation of mind in him like in an ascetic who is beyond worldly pain and
pleasure. Rama, the man of great courage, refused fans and umbrella, sent away his friends, chariot
and citizens, kept back sorrow in his mind, subdued his senses and entered his mother's house to
inform the unpleasant news.</p>
<p class="tat">The people adjacent to Rama could not visualise any change in the face of Rama who
was dignified and truthful in his words. Rama did not lose his natural joy, as an autumnal moon
with lofty rays does not lose its natural splendour. Rama with his courageous spirit and of great
fame, paying his respects to the people with his sweet words, went nearer to his mother.Lakshmana,
who got virtues equal to Rama, who was having great heroic valour and who was the brother, kept the
grief within himself and went along with Rama.</p>
<p class="tat">When Rama entered, Kausalya's palace was filled with great joy. At that time, Rama
did not show any displeasure for the mishap occurred in reality. He behaved like that because he
had doubted about the possible shock to his friends and even of fear to their life, if he showed
any perturabation.</p>
