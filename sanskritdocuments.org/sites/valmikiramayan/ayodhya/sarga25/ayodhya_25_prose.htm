<p class="tat">Kausalya, the magnanimous mother putting away her grief, sipped water from the palm
of the hand, became purified and performed rites conducive to the welfare of Rama. She said: "Oh,
Rama! Your departure cannot be restrained. Depart now, return soon. Abide in the footsteps of the
virtuous. Oh, Rama! Let that righteousness, which you are fostering with courage and discipline,
protect you. Oh, son! May those too to whom you will be bowing in salutation at cross-roads and in
temples, those along with great saints protect you in the forest. All the arms given by the wise
sage Viswamitra to you, will ever protect you who are ever illumined by your excellences. Oh, son
with magnificent arms! Protected by your service to father and service to mother as well as  to
truthfulness, you will be long-lived. Oh, Rama, the best among men! May the wooden sticks used for
feeding the sacred fire, blades of the sacred Kusa grass and rings of Kusa grass (worn on the
fourth finger on sacrificial occasions), sacrificial altars , temples and various sites selected by
Brahmanas for worship of gods, mountains, trees, bushes, large and deep pools of water, birds,
snakes and lions protect you. May the saadhyas and viswadevas (two different kinds of gods) and
wind-gods along with eminent sages ensure your happiness. May the cosmic person and the creator
bring happiness to you. May the Pusha, Bhaga and Aryama (three of the twelve sons of Aditi) and the
guardians of the spheres with Indra as their head do good to you. May the six seasons, all the
fortnights and months, years, nights, days and hours always do good to you. May Veda, the Smriti
texts taken as one body, the resolution and the piety protect you, my son! May lord Skanda (the
younger son of Lord Siva) and the moon god along with the sage Brihaspati (the preceptor of gods),
the well known seven sages as well as Sage Narada guard you on all sides. May the four quarters
along with the glorious guardians of the four quarters which are eulogised by me may protect you
always on all sides in that forest. Let all mountains , oceans, king of oceans, Varuna, heaven and
earth, the intermediate space between them , rivers , astrological mansions including gods
presiding over them, day and night, the morning and evening twilights may protect you while you
reside in the forest . The six holy seasons, months, years and the measures of time known as Kala
(equilent to one minute) and Kastha (1/30th of Kala or two seconds) bestow you happiness. Let the
heavenly deities and the demons too ever grant happiness on you while you traverse through the
large forest, in the guise of a hermit and full of wisdom  Oh, son! Let there not be fear for you
of demons the terrible ones performing cruel deeds, of devilish beings called Pisachas and of all
carnivorous animals. In that impenetrable forest occupied by you, let there be no monkeys,
scorpions, gad fies, mosquitoes, snakes or other insects . Oh, son! Let the great elephants, lions,
tigers, bears, terrible he-buffaloes with horns not to be hostile to you. Oh, son! Let the other
ferocious man-eaters belonging to animal-species, being worshipped by me here, not hurt you .Oh,
Rama, my son! May your path-ways be propitious ! Let your valour be powerful! Go well with all
accomplishments!. Let there be security to you against those dwelling in the atmosphere and on the
earth as well as against all the celestials as also your enemies. Oh, Rama! May Venus and the moon
as also the sun and Kubera (the god of wealth) and Yama (the god of death) who are being worshipped
by me, protect you, while you reside in the forest of Dandaka Oh, Rama! May sacred hymns coming
forth from fire, air, vapour and from the mouth of singer of sacred hymns protect you at the time
of taking bath. Let Siva, the lord of all spheres, Brahma, the lord of creation, Vishnu, the
nourisher of beings, the sages and the rest of the celestials may protect you dwelling in the
forest."</p>
<p class="tat">Uttering thus, the illustrious Kausalya having large eyes, worshipped troops of
divinities with garlands and sandal paste with befitting hymns of praise. Duly procuring fire, she
caused oblation to be poured into it, as per the direction of a high souled brahmana for the
purpose of Rama's well- being . Kausalya, the excellent woman procured clarified butter , white
garlands, ceremonial sticks and white mustard seeds.That preceptor performed ceremony for peace as
per the statute as well as without error and carried out propitiatory oblation externally with the
remaining sacrificial food left after the main offering .She then got brahmanas to pronounce
blessings with honey, curd , unbroken grains of rice and clarified butter by the repetition of
certain hymns and to utter prayers for the well - being of Rama in the forest.</p>
<p class="tat">The illustrious Kausalya gave the desired fee to that chief of brahmanas and spoke
as follows to Rama:- "Which felicity occurred in Devendra the thousand- eyed, adored by all
celestials when a demon called Vritta was destroyed, let that felicity occur to you. Which blessing
was invoked by Vinata to Garuda who was setting off to bring nectar in the past, may that blessing
occur to you. Which blessing was bestowed on Devendra, the wielder of the thunderbolt , killing the
demons at the time of producing nectar, let that blessing come to you. Oh, Rama! Which good fortune
occurred to Vishnu who was immensely glorious while making his three strides (in order to measure
the three worlds), let that good fortune come to you Oh, Rama, the mighty armed! May the seasons ,
oceans , Dvipas (principal division of earth girdled by oceans ), vedas, various spheres and
quarters confer blessings with good luck to you."</p>
<p class="tat">Saying so, Kausalya, the large eyed proud woman placed some unbroken rice grains on
her son's head, smeared varieties of sandal pastes over his body, fastened about his wrist by way
of an amulet, a herb called Visalyakarani (so called because it helps in painlessly extracting an
arrow stuck into one's body ) which is efficacious and auspicious and muttered sacred hymns in
order to enhance its virtue.Though filled with grief inside, she appeared to be over-joyed outside
and with faltering words, spoke thus with only mouth and not with her heart.</p>
<p class="tat">The illusrious Kausalya embraced Rama, smelling his head by bending it and spoke
these words "Rama, my son! Go with ease with accomplishment of purpose, as you are. Oh, son! With
all your purposes fulfilled and with good health, I shall see you returning to Ayodhya happily and
taking over the reins of the kingdom All my thoughts of grief having been expulsed and my face
shining with joy, I shall behold you returning from the forest like the full moon rising from the
horizon Oh, Rama! I shall behold you returning here from your sojourn in the forest, having
fulfilled your father's word and installed on the splendid throne. Having come here from your
sojourn in the forest, you will be familiar with auspicious things and will ever be augmenting the
desires of my daughter-in-law and of me. Depart now, Oh, Rama ! Worshipped by me, let the hosts of
gods headed by Siva, the Supreme Being, the great sages, spirits, the chief of evil spirits, the
celestial serpents and the (four)quarters wish well of you, who is setting forth to forest, "</p>
<p class="tat">Having so said and having completed the rite of invoking blessings befittingly,
Kausalya whose eyes were overflowing with tears, further went clockwise around Rama and having
pressed close to him, embraced again and again.</p>
<p class="tat">Having been done circumambulation (as a mark of protection) thus by the pious woman
Kausalya, that highly illustrious Rama pressing his mother's feet (as a token of reverence) again
and again, shining as he was by his own splendour, proceeded to Sita's apartments.</p>
