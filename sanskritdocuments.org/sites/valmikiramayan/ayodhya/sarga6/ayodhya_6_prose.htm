<h3><title>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose </h3>
<h3>Sarga 6</h3>


<p class="txt">In this chapter Valmiki narrates various rituals undertaken by Rama the crown
prince, along with his wife Seetha, on the eve of his anointment ceremony. The festivities in
Ayodhya, the happiness of the people with King Dasaratha's decision to anoint Rama are also
described here. Also, people from different directions arrive in Ayodhya to be there on the grand
occasion.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">After Vasistha left, Rama took bath and meditated on Lord Narayana with undistracted
mind along with his wide-eyed wife, Seetha. Taking the vessel with clarified butter on his head as
per scriptures, he offered to Lord Vishnu the clarified butter, by dropping it into the blazing
fire.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama ate the remainder of clarified butter after finishing the sacrifice, which he
performed for his own good, silently meditated on Lord Narayana with controlled mind and slept
along with Seetha on a properly laid bed of Kusa grass in a splendid temple of Lord Vishnu. *</p>
<p class="comment">* The learned commentators point out that the deity referred to here is no other
than Lord Ranganatha, who had been worshipped by a long line of rulers of Ayodhya as their chosen
deity in a separate shrine built within the precincts of the royal palace. We are told at length in
the Patala Khanda of Padma Purana how Rama so kindly handed over the image to Vibhishana; through
whom it reached Srirangam (near Tiruchirapally) in South India; where it exists even to this day
and is held in the highest reverence by the Vaishnavas and other devotees all over India.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama woke up three hours before dawn and caused to complete the entire decoration of
the house. Listening to the pleasing verses of professional reciters, he worshipped the early
sunrise and meditated on Gayatri* with an undistracted mind.</p>
<p class="comment">* Gayatri is an ancient meter of twenty-four syllables as a triplet of eight
syllables each (Rigveda iii-62-10: - tat savitur varenyam bhargo devasya dhimahi dhiyo yo nah
prachodayat) addressed to Savitri or the Sun as generator. Gayatri personified is considered as the
mother of the first three classes viz. priestly class, warrior - class and the trader-class in
their capacity of twice born.</p>
<p class="tat">He praised Lord Vishnu by bowing his head before Him. By wearing pure silk clothes,
he got valedictory text recited by Brahmans. Their deep and sweet chorus of the valedictory, united
with the accompanying musical instruments, then filled the city of Ayodhya.</p>
<p class="tat">All the people residing in Ayodhya were delighted when they heard that Rama and
Seetha had observed fast for the ensuing anointment ceremony. All the citizens decorated the town
for coronation function of Rama, soon before sunrise. Banners and colorful flags were hoisted on
temples, which looked brilliantly like the silver lining of cloud, at road junctions, in streets,
on big trees situated in temple compounds, from watching towers at city gates, on shops of wealthy
merchants, on buildings of rich family persons, on all assembly halls and all visible trees.</p>
<p class="tat">From different sides, actors were showing their talents, dancers were performing
dance. Singers were singing and sweet voices were heard, pleasing the minds and ears. With Rama's
anointment ceremony approaching, people were engaged in mutual conversations in their houses and at
road junctions, about the ceremony.</p>
<p class="tat">Even children playing together before gateways of houses were telling each other,
narratives of Rama's anointment ceremony. The citizens made king's road splendid, by sprinkling
flowers on it and by making it good smelling with burning of incense and perfumes, on the occasion
of Rama's anointment ceremony.</p>
<p class="tat">On a doubt of approach of night on completion of the ceremony, they arranged lamps
in the shape of trees to illuminate all the streets. All the citizens residing in Ayodhya, having
thus decorated the city desiring Rama's coronation, gathered together in groups at road junctions
and in assembly halls, mutually talking about this matter there and praising king Dasaratha.</p>
<p class="tat">"O! This king Dasaratha, who delights Ikshvaaku dynasty, having known himself that
he became aged, is going to anoint Rama for the kingdom. What a great man he is! Rama; who has seen
the totality of the world is going to become our protector for long. We have all been blessed by
king Dasaratha. Rama is modest, knowledgeable and righteous. He is as compassionate to us as to his
brothers. Let the faultless and righteous king Dasaratha live long! Due to his blessings, we are
going to see Rama as being anointed for the kingdom."</p>
<p class="tat">The villagers, who came from different directions after hearing the news of
coronation ceremony of Rama, listened to the narration of the citizens of Ayodhya. The city of
Ayodhya was filled with villagers who came from different directions to see the anointment ceremony
of Rama. The noise in the city was heard by the groups of those people, while moving here and
there, as the roaring of an impetuous ocean on full moon days.</p>
<p class="tat">That city of Ayodhya equal to the residence of the celestial god Indra, disturbed
with the sound being made all over by the villagers who came with the desire to see the ceremony,
shone like a roaring ocean filled with sea animals.</p>
