<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 81</h3>


<p class="txt">When Bharata hear the sound of couches and drums early in the morning, he gets more
depressed. He orders for stopping of those sounds and starts lamenting. Then, Vasishta the
family-priest enters the assembly-hall and sends messengers, asking them to call Bharata urging him
to be present in the court, and in response to his call, Bharata with Shatrughna, the ministers and
others enter the assembly.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">Then, bards and pangegyrists, who knew the importance of tidings, eulogized Bharata
with auspicious hymns of praise on the night preceding Naandimukha.</p>
<p class="comment">Naandimukha: The name of a ceremony in honour and for the benefit of dead
relatives observed on a festive occasion to secure their blessings.</p>
<p class="tat">A drum from the sound of which nigh-hours are identified, struck with a golden
stick, gave its sound. Couches and loud-sounding instruments in hundreds producing various types of
noises were blown. That mammoth sound of the musical instruments, as if filling up the whole sky,
created further distress and grief to Bharata who was already tormented with grief.</p>
<p class="tat">Then, the awakened Bharata proclaiming that "I am not the king", caused to stop that
sound and spoke the following words to shatrughna: "Behold, O, Shatrughna! How much harm was done
to the world by Kaikeyi! The king Dasartha left us, leaving all sorrows to me. This prosperous
kingdom of Ayodhya, a foundation of law and religion of that high-souled Dasaratha the righteous
king is now like boat without a rudder moving hitter and thither in water. Even that Rama, who was
a great protector has been sent to the forest by this very mother of mine, abandoning her
righteousness."</p>
<p class="tat">Seeing Bharata who lost his consciousness by lamenting in that way, all the women
then miserably cried in one voice. While Bharata was lamenting thus, the great illustrious Vasishta
who knew the rules relating to kings, entered the assembly-hall of Dasaratha the Lord of Ikshvaku
dynasty. The pious minded Vasishta along with his attendants entered that lovely assembly-hall,
made of gold and studded with gems and jewels, resembling Sudharma the celestial assembly-hall.</p>
<p class="tat"> Vasista, who knew all the scriptures, then sat in a presidential chair made of gold
and wrapped with a comfortable cushion. He ordered the messengers as follows: "Quickly bring
Brahmanas (a class of people having divine knowledge), Kshatriyas (people belonging to
warrior-class), Vaisyas (agriculturists and traders), ministers and troop commanders coolly. There
is an urgent duty indeed for us to be done. Bring Shatrughna with his royal attendants, the
illustrious Bharata, Yudhaajit (Bharata's maternal uncle) Sumantra the charioteer and those people
who are royal well-wishers there."</p>
<p class="tat">There was a huge hallooing sound generated while the people invited were coming on
chariots, horses and elephants. People of high position like ministers and other welcomed the
approaching Bharata in every way as they had welcomed Dasaratha and as Indra was welcomed by
celestials. That royal assembly, made splendid by Bharata the son of Dasartha, radiated as before
as with the presence of Dasaratha, like a lake of tranquil waters sown with pearls shells and sand
and filled with great fish and serpents.</p>
