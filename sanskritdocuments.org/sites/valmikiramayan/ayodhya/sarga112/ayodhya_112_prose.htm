<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 112</h3>


<p class="txt">On hearing the debate between Rama and Bharata, all the sages there were astonished.
The sages request Bharata to accept Rama's words. Bharata explains to Rama that he is unable to
rule the vast kingdom alone to the satisfaction of its subjects. Bharata further adds that Rama has
the necessary competence to save the world and makes a fervent appeal to Rama to return to Ayodhya.
However, Rama replies that Bharata is quite capable of ruling the kingdom and advises Bharata to
take counsel from his wise ministers before administering the kingdom. Rama reaffirms Bharata that
he will never be false to his father's vow. Finally, Bharata agrees to Rama's proposition, but
requests Rama to offer his sandals to be carried by him to Ayodhya so that the people there would
get gain and security. Rama agrees to it and offers his sandals to Bharata, who takes a vow before
Rama to enter fire in case he did not return immediately after the expiry of his term of exile.
After embracing Bharata and Shatrughna, Rama bids farewell to all with due respect in accord with
the rank of each and enters his hermitage.</p>

<p class="tat">Witnessing that thrilling converse between those two brothers with incomparable
dignity, the great sages gathered there were astonished. The assemblies of ascetics, great saints
present there and the distinguished sages who stood invisible in space, applauded both Rama and
Bharata, the magnanimous brothers, saying (as follows):</p>
<p class="tat">"That Dasaratha, who begot these two sons, who know righteousness and whose strength
is justice, was fortunate. By hearing the debate between these two princes, we are indeed
delighted."</p>
<p class="tat"> Thereafter, that assembly of sages, who wished to see a quick destruction of
Ravana, came together and spoke the following words to Bharata, the excellent king.</p>
<p class="tat">"O Bharata born in a noble race, highly intelligent, having a superior conduct and a
great repute! If you have regard for your father, Rama's words are to be accepted. We wish to see
Rama absolved of all obligations forever to his father. Dasaratha, having honoured his pledge to
Kaikeyi, indeed went to heaven."</p>
<p class="tat">Having uttered that much, all the celestial musicians and the great sages then went
to their respective abodes. Hearing those auspicious words, the good-looking Rama looked radiant
and worshipped those sages with a joyful countenance.</p>
<p class="tat">Bharata, on his part, with trembled limbs, joined his palms in salutation and again
spoke the following words to Rama in a strangled voice: "O, Rama! Keep in view the continuance of
our royal statue and the statute of the race. You ought to yield to the entreaties of mine and
those of your mother. I am not able to rule this vast empire alone to the satisfaction of the
beloved inhabitants of town and country!"</p>
<p class="tat">"Our kith and king, soldiers, companions and allies are waiting for you indeed, as
farmers wait for the rainy clouds. O, the sagacious Rama! Return to the kingdom and keep it in
order. You have the competence to save the world! </p>
<p class="tat">That Bharata, who was kind-spoken, thus made a fervent appeal to Rama and fell at
his feet.</p>
<p class="tat">Placing on his lap, that Bharata of dark hue, with eyes resembling lotus-petals and
having a voice like that of a swan in rut, Rama spoke the following words to him:</p>
<p class="tat">"O, my dear brother! You are very much competent to rule the earth, by the intellect
you obtained both inherently and by training. Take counsel with your ministers, companions and
intelligent counsellors and get all activities done, even if they are gigantic. Light may go off
from the moon; Himalayan mountain may shake off its snows; the sea may transgress its shores, but I
will never be false to my father's vow! My dear brother! Your mother acted thus, for your sake, out
of her affection or ambition. It should not be carried out in your mind. You ought to obey her as
your mother."</p>
<p class="tat"> Bharata replied (as follows) to Rama, who was speaking as aforesaid and who was
equal to sun by his splendour or to the moon in its first quarter.</p>
<p class="tat">"O, noble brother! Pray mount with your feet on the wooden sandals adorned with
gold! Surely, these will bestow, gain and security to all the people!" Rama, the tiger among men,
possessing exceptional glory, placing his feet on the sandals and leaving them, gave them to the
magnanimous Bharata.</p>
<p class="tat">Bowing before the sandals, Bharata spoke the following words to Rama: "O, Rama the
hero and the tormentator of enemies! For fourteen years, I shall wear matted locks and robes of
bark, live on fruits and roots O Rama, and live outside the city, offering the ruling of the
kingdom to your sandals. O, Rama! If I do not see you the following day when the fourteenth year
has fully ended, I shall enter the fire once for all."</p>
<p class="tat">"So be it" promised Rama, embraced that Bharata with affection, took Shatrughna also
in his arms and spoke to Bharata as follows:</p>
<p class="tat">"O Bharata! Protect your mother, Kaikeyi. Do not get angry with her. You are taken
vow thus by me and by Seetha." speaking thus, Rama with his eyes filled with tears, bade farewell
to his brother. The valiant Bharata, who knew righteousness worshipped those sandals which were
well-decorated made a circumambulation to Rama and kept the sandals on the head of an excellent
elephant.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama, the augmentator of Raghu dynasty, being firm as a Himalayan rock in abiding in
his own righteousness, greeted those men, in accord with their rank, the host of his preceptors,
ministers, subjects and his brothers and bade farewell to all of them. His mothers, their voices
choked with tears due to sorrow, were unable to bid farewell verbally to Rama. However, Rama
himself offered his salutations to all his mothers and entered his hermitage, weeping.</p>
