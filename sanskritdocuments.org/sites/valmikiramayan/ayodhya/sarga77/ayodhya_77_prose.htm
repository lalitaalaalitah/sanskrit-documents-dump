<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 77</h3>


<p class="txt">On the twelfth day of the death of Dasaratha, Bharata gives various presents to
Brahmans. On the thirteenth day when Bharata and Shatrughna go to the cremation ground to collect
the bones both of them are overwhelmed with grief and fall down on the ground. Vasista, the family
priest and Sumantra raise them up and pacifying urge both of them to complete the remaining rites
to be performed on the thirteenth day.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">After having passed the tenth day of the death of Dasaratha, Bharata having himself
purified, performed Shraddha* rites on the arrival of the twelfth day.</p>
<p class="comment">* Shraddha rites are in the honor and for the benefit of dead relatives observed
with great strictness at various fixed periods and on the occasion of rejoicing as well as mourning
by the surviving relatives. These are performed by the daily offering of water and on the stated
occasion by the offering of Pindas or balls of rice and meal to three paternal forefathers i.e.
Father, grandfather, and great grandfather. It is an act of reverential homage to a deceased person
performed by relatives, most desirably by a son of the deceased. On the occasion of Shraddha rites,
Bharata gave precious stones, money, a lot of cooked rice, very valuable clothes and various other
kinds of presents to Brahmans. In that ceremony performed in honor of the dead king, Bharata the
son of Dasaratha gave multitudes of white goats, hundreds of cows, servants and servant maids,
vehicles and very big houses to Brahmans.</p>
<p class="tat">Then, at the time of dawn on the thirteenth day, the mighty armed Bharata who came
for clearing up bones and ashes, wept in grief, his throat being choked of sound (because of
crying) and spoke in great distress the following words, having reached the foot of his father's
funeral pile (to collect the bones and ashes for their immersion in Sarayu River). "O, father! My
brother Rama to whose care I was entrusted by you, having gone on exile to the forest, I now become
abandoned wholly alone, by you. Where have you gone, leaving Kausalya the mother whose son Rama,
her support, has been sent away from home to the forest?"</p>
<p class="tat"> Seeing that spot of collection (of bones), which became reddish brown in colour
because of ashes, with bones consumed by fire and his father's body having extinguished, Bharata
was depressed and began to cry loudly. Miserable as he was to see the spot, Bharata fell weeping on
the ground, as a flag staff fastened by any mechanical contrivance would drop down while being
raised in honor of Indra the god of celestials. All his ministers hastily approached Bharata who
was virtuous in conduct, as sages once rushed to the fallen Yayati at the time of his death. Seeing
Bharata, Shatrughna was also overwhelmed with grief and while recollecting the king, fell
unconscious on the ground.</p>
<p class="tat">Remembering the many gestures of his father resulting from his loving qualities made
from time to time, Shatrughna was lamenting (as follows) like one who has lost his wits, bewildered
as he was. "We are immersed in a violent and appalling ocean of sorrow invoked by Mandhara, in
which Kaikeyi in the form of a crocodile swam in its current the irrevocable boons granted to her
by my father. O, father! Where have you gone leaving the lamenting Bharata, your boy always being
caressed by you. You used to fulfill the wishes of all of us, in the matter of eatables, drinks,
clothes, and jewels. Who else will do it (now) for us. That earth which is deprived of you, the
high soled and righteous king, is not riven even when it is the time to be riven. The father having
obtained heaven and Rama having taken refuge in a forest, what is the significance of life for me?
I shall enter a fire. Bereft of my brother and father, I can not return to the deserted city of
Ayodhya, where Ikshvaku used to reign. I shall retire to a hermitage."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing the lamentation of both of them and beholding their plight, all their
companions were disturbed very much, once again. Both Shatrughna, and Bharata were wearied with
grief and began to roll on the ground, like two bulls whose horns have been broken.</p>
<p class="tat">Then, Vasista, a noble man, a learned man and the family priest of their father,
raised up that Bharata from the ground and spoke the following words:  "O, Lord Bharata! This is
the thirteenth day of the death of your father. Why are you hanging down here, when the ceremony of
collecting the bones is still unfinished? The three pairs of opposites (namely hunger and thirst,
joy and sorrow; birth and death) occur to all living beings without any distinction. They being
inevitable, you ought not to behave like this."</p>
<p class="tat">Even Sumantra, who knew the Truth, raising up Shatrughna and pacifying him, told him
about the origin and dissolution of all beings. The two illustrious tigers among men (Bharata and
Satrughna) who had got up, appeared like two banners severally raised in honor of Indra (the god of
celestials) soiled through rain and the sun. The ministers hurried up the princes, who were wiping
their tears and who were talking pitiably with their eyes reddened (due to excessive weeping) to
expedite the other rites pertaining to the thirteenth day.</p>
