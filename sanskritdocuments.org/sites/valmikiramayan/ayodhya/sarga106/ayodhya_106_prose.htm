<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 106</h3>


<p class="txt">Bharata requests Rama, giving various reasons, to accept the throne of Ayodhya. He
abuses his deceased father for having transgressed the righteousness merely for a fear of wrath
from Kaikeyi and requests Rama to reverse that transgression of righteousness. Bharata takes a vow
not to return to Ayodhya but to continue to stay in the forest in case Rama did not heed to his
request. Rama's mothers also join Bharata and urge Rama to grant his request, when they find Rama
lukewarm in the matter and insistent on implementing the words of his deceased father.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">When Rama thus kept silent after uttering those meaningful words as aforesaid, the
pious Bharata for his part addressed to virtuous Rama who was fond of people conformable to justice
at the banks of that River Mandakini.</p>
<p class="tat">"Who, in this world, is endowed with such qualities like you, O annihilator of
enemies! Neither does sorrow disturb you nor does joy enrapture you. You are highly honoured by
elders and you clarify your doubts from them. "By what should he be moved, who looks on life and
death, misfortune or prosperity with an equal eye? O, King! He who knows the totality of time as
you do, ought not to feel despondent even on meeting with adversity."</p>
<p class="tat">"O, the magnanimous Rama! you are equally strong as celestials. You are true to your
promise, all-knowing, all-viewing and endowed with understanding. Even the most fearful calamity
ought not to attack you, endowed as you are, with such attributes; and recognizing the birth and
end of all beings. The sinful deed, committed by my mean mother for my sake during my absence, was
not to my liking. (Hence) be gracious to me."</p>
<p class="tat">"I am bound by the chains of morality. For that reason, I do not kill with a severe
punishment, my mother who was of perverse conduct and worthy of retribution. How can I, born of
Dasaratha of noble birth and deeds and conversant of right and wrong, do the most wicked and
horrible act?"</p>
<p class="tat">"The King Dasaratha was my preceptor, had several sacrificial performances to his
credit was aged, was my father, equal to a deity and is now dead. Hence, I cannot reproach him in
an open assembly. O Rama the knower of piety! What man who knows the principles of righteousness,
would commit such an improper act, bereft of one's interest and duty, in order just to please a
woman?"</p>
<p class="tat">"There is an ancient saying that at the time of death, beings lose their judgment.
The king, acting as he did, has made this saying indeed true in the eyes of the world. This
transgression of righteousness was done by our father for fear of anger (of Kaikeyi) or through
infatuation and over-haste. You do keep in view a noble purpose and reverse that
transgression."</p>
<p class="tat">"A son who honours only a good deviation (from righteousness) of a father is
accepted as a real son in this world. He who acts otherwise than this would be facing a quite
reverse situation. You be that real son. Do not lend yourself to the infamous act, committed by our
father, which in this world, confident men freely condemn. "Save Kaikeyi and me, our father, our
friends, our relatives, all the urbanites and the villagers as well as the entire kingdom. Where is
the forest and where is the princely dignity? Where is the matted hair and where is the protection
of a kingdom? You ought not to do such a contradictory act."</p>
<p class="tat">"O, the highly enlightened hero! The first duty of a warrior is indeed to get
crowned, so that he may then protect his subjects. Which man of warrior-caste would set aside his
manifest duty and practise a virtue that gives doubtful result, which does not promise happiness,
which has a mental restraint and which is uncertain? If you desire to pursue a virtue alone;
although born of pain, then take pains while protecting the four castes as per tradition, by
recourse to righteousness."</p>
<p class="tat">"O, Rama the knower of righteousness! The knower of what is right indeed tell that
the life of a house-holder is the noblest of all the four* stages of life. How can you abandon it?"
</p>
<p class="comment">*Four Stages of life Brahmacherya (student-life); Garhasthya (life of a
house-holder); Vanaprastha (life of a hermit); Sannyaasa (Life of an ascetic).</p>
<p class="tat">"I am indeed junior to you in the point of learning, situation and by birth. How
should I rule the earth, while still you are living? I, a mere child, who am devoted of
intelligence and virtues besides placed in an inferior position, cannot even live without you."</p>
<p class="tat">"O, Rama the knower of righteousness! Rule this entire kingdom belonging to your
father, without distraction, without hindrance and as per the conduct prescribed for you along with
your relatives."</p>
<p class="tat">"Let all the king's ministers along with Vasishta and other priests well-versed in
sacred formulas, crown you, the knower of sacred texts, here itself. You, having been crowned thus,
may proceed to Ayodhya along with us to rule it, like Indra the Lord of celestials, having
conquered all the worlds with his might, proceeds to his kingdom along with celestials."</p>
<p class="tat">"You shall discharge the three obligations subdue all the enemies, gratify the
wishes of all your friends and you alone rule me in Ayodhya. </p>
<p class="comment">Three obligations to the Gods, the Ancestors and Brahmins.</p>
<p class="tat">"O, excellent among men! Wipe off my mother's curse today and protect our venerable
father from his sin. I request you by bowing my head before you. Show compassion on me and on all
our relatives as Lord Shiva ( the Supreme Deity) on all beings. Else if you disregard my entire
request and move again into the forest form here, I too will go along with you."</p>
<p class="tat">Even while being propitiated by Bharata as above, by bowing his head duly sinking in
his spirit, the illustrious Rama, the Lord of the earth was still abiding in the words of his
father and did not feel inclined to return to Ayodhya. Seeing that wonderful staunchness in Rama,
the people of Ayodhya felt sorrowful and at the same time, experienced joy. They became distressed
that he was not going to Ayodhya and felt rejoiced to see his firmness of resolve. The priests,
citizens and elders of that multitude as well as Queens, distracted and weeping bitterly, acclaimed
Bharata who was then speaking thus, duly prostrating himself before Rama and added their
supplications to Rama.</p>
