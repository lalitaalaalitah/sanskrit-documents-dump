<h3>Book II : Ayodhya Kanda - Book Of Ayodhya</h3>
<h3>Chapter[Sarga] 106<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Bharata requests Rama, giving various reasons, to accept the throne of Ayodhya. He abuses his deceased father for having transgressed
the righteousness merely for a fear of wrath from Kaikeyi and requests Rama to reverse that transgression of righteousness. Bharata takes a vow not
to return to Ayodhya but to continue to stay in the forest in case Rama did not heed to his request. Rama's mothers also join Bharata and urge Rama
to grant his request, when they find Rama lukewarm in the matter and insistent on implementing the words of his deceased father.</p>
