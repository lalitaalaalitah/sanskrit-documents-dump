<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 41</h3>

<p class="tat">The ladies of the royal gymnasium lament over the exile of Rama and others. The
citizens of Ayodhya also are reduced to a miserable plight. All Nature mourns at Rama's departure.

<p class="tat"><span class="tat">As Rama the tiger among men, having paid obeisance with joined
palms departed, a great cry of distress arose among women of inner apartments. "</span>Where is he
going, who was the path, who became the protector of the people, who are now defenseless weak and
unhappy? Where has he gone, who was not angry even when provoked, who resolved every
misunderstanding and who propitiated all those who were angry by sharing their suffering? That
illustrious and great-souled Rama, who treated us with the same reverence he paid to his own
mother, where has he gone? He the protector of the people and the whole world, driven to the forest
by the king, goaded on by Kaikeyi? Alas! In his folly, the king has banished the virtuous the
beloved and the strictly truthful Rama to the forest!" Thus did all the queens lament, like unto
cows deprived of their calves and in there affection cried out loudly. Hearing those terrible
crying sounds in the private apartments, the king profoundly afflicted by the departure of his son,
became increasingly depressed.</p>
<p class="tat">On the departure of Rama to the forest, the sacred fires were no longer performed,
no house holder prepared food, the people did not do their acts and even the sun went into eclipse.
Elephants threw out the morsels of food they had taken into their mouths. Cows did not give suck to
their calves. Mother did not rejoice, for having got a son born for the first time. Trisanku,
Lohintanga, Brihaspati as also Budha and all other planets assumed a menacing aspect and got stayed
with the moon. Stars ceased to twinkle. Planets were deprived of their splendour. The stars of
Visakha appeared in the heaven, veiled in the mist. The great ocean rose, as by a speed of a
long-lasting tempest. While Rama went to the forest, that city was shaken. All the cardinal points,
having been disturbed, were covered by darkness. Planets did not become visible, nor the stars nor
any other thing in heaven. All the people of the city suddenly became apathetic. No one was
interested in either food or in pastime. All the people of Ayodhya, afflicted by grief in
succession, heaved profound and burning sighs and bewailed about the departure of the Lord of the
earth. The people in the king's way were wearing distressed faces filled with tears. No one
appeared rejoicing. All were possessed by grief. The wind was not blowing coolly. The moon did not
appear beneficent. The sun did not give out warmth to the earth. The entire world was in disorder
Sons did not ask for their mothers and husbands did not ask for their wives. Brothers did not
enquire about their sisters. All gave up every thing and thought of  Rama alone. Then, all of
Rama's own friends were bewildered in mind and the weight of their agony overwhelmed them. They did
not leave their beds. Afflicted by fear and grief, the earth with its mountains, deprived of that
great souled Rama, suffered a terrible convulsion, as when it is abandoned by Indra the lord of
rain, and a great uproar reigned in the city which was filled with elephants, warriors and
horses.</p>

Valmiki, the work of a sage and the oldest epic.</h4>
