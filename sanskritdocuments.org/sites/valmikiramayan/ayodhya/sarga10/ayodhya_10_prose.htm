<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 10</h3>
<p class="txt">In this chapter, Kaikeyi enters the house of wrath. Dasaratha tries to pacify her
anger.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">Having been thus wrongly preached by that sinful Manthara. Kaikeyi lied down on the
floor as a Kinnara woman beaten by a poisoned arrow. The skillful Kaikeyi, after deciding in mind
what ought to be done told it all slowly to Manthara. Being stupefied by the words of Manthara,
that Kaikeyi became dejected, made firm resolve, with deep and warm sigh, like a maiden-serpent and
thought for that moment about the ways which can lead to her happiness. Manthara, who is Kaikeyi's
companion and who is desirous of getting benefit, heard of Kaikeyi's firm resolve and became very
much pleased as if she achieved success. Kaikeyi, being angry and well determined, lied down on the
floor with eye brows, knitted in her face. Thereafter, she threw away her colourful chaplets and
beautiful ornaments on to the floor.</p>
<p class="tat">Those chaplets and ornaments which were thrown away by her were making the earth
shine, as stars to the sky. Tying her single braid of hair tightly over her head and wearing soiled
clothes, that Kaikeyi lying down in the chamber of wrath was looking like a Kinnara woman lying
down dead. King Dasaratha ordered for various arrangements to be made for Rama's coronation, took
permission to leave from the elders who were present there and entered his palace. King Dasaratha,
who kept all activates under his control entered into the inner chambers to tell the good news of
Rama's coronation to Kaikeyi who was a worthy woman to be told the good news first (thinking that
she has not yet heard the news). That Dasaratha with vast glory entered Kaikeyi's chambers as moon
enters the sky with white clouds.</p>
<p class="tat">King Dasaratha entered his magnificent palace but could not find his beloved Kaikeyi
on her best couch there. Peacocks and parrots were being reared in that palace, sounds of birds
like curlews, and swans were heard around. The place was resonant with sounds of musical
instruments. Short and hunch-backed maid-servants were moving here and there. There were bowers
surrounded with creepers and lovely champaka and Ashoka trees. There were painted rooms. There were
altars built with ivory, silver and gold. There were trees yielding flowers and fruits in all
seasons and wells in the middle. There were beautiful seats constructed with ivory, silver and
gold. Various types of food, drinks and snacks were made available. That palace was looking like
heaven with beautifully adorned women. Being possessed of power of lust, that king who came with
object of sexual pleasure, was distressed in not finding his beloved wife and enquired the people
there. In former times, Kaikeyi did not keep away herself at that kind of hour, nor the king enter
her chambers at any time without her presence. After entering the house, king Dasaratha enquired
with the maid-servants there as before, without knowing about foolish Kaikeyi who desired to get
her selfish ends. Then, a female door-keeper fearfully folding her hands in supplication, said:
"Oh, king! The queen ran to her chamber of wrath with much anger". That Dasaratha having much
disturbed mind already for the absence of Kaikeyi there, became more dejected after hearing the
words of door-keeper. </p>
<p class="tat">King Dasaratha, after seeing Kaikeyi lying down on floor in the chamber of wrath,
became tormented with grief. That Dasaratha,saw his wife, who was sinless, a youthful woman dearer
than his life, lying down on the floor with an intent to do sin. At that time, she was looking like
a completely uprooted creeper, like a fallen angel, like a thrown down Kinnara woman, like an
expelled divine dancer Apsarasa, like a dropped off illusionism and like a female deer tied up in a
net. That Dasaratha touched Kaikeyi affectionately, as a great elephant in a forest touches a
female elephant which is wounded by poisoned arrow. That Dasaratha, possessed with infatuation and
having fearful mind, touched that lotus-eyed woman with his hands and spoke the following
words.</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh queen, of auspicious qualities! I do not know that you are angry with me. Who
has cursed or disrespected you? I am pained to see you resting in this way on a dirty floor .When I
am here to expend all good to you, why are you hurting my mind by lying down on the floor like the
one who is possessed of a devil. There are so many royal physicians who are skilled and famous .
They can make you healthy. Tell me your sickness To whom do you want a favour to be done? Who has
offended you? Tell me to whom I have to extend a favour now and to whom I have to do a great
offensive act .Oh, Kaikeyi! Do not weep and get your body dried up. If you tell, I shall kill a
person who is exempt from death or shall release a person who is worthy to be killed. I shall make
a poor man prosperous or a rich man, destitute. I and all my people are submissive to you. I do not
wish to foil even a little of your intention. Tell me that which is desired by your mind to be
achieved even at the cost of my life. You need not suspect me, as you very well know your authority
over me. I keep my oath on my righteousness that I shall certainly do whatever is liked by you. My
jurisdiction over this earth stretches out as much to the extent as to the extent a chariot-wheel
revolves. Eastern countries, Sindhu, Sauviira and Saurastra countries, as well as countries in the
south, Vanga, Anga, Magadha and Matsya countries, Kasi and Kausala countries are all full of
riches. In those countries, gold and grain, sheep and goats and all types of goods are produced.
Oh, Kaikeyi! which of the goods do you want to acquire? Oh, fearful one! why are you exerted like
this? Oh, beautiful lady! Get up, get up! Oh, Kaikeyi! Tell me the source of  your fear. I shall
remove that source as sun sets aside the mist." Consoled by hearing the words of Dasaratha, Kaikeyi
intending to put up that unkind proposal ( like Rama's exile ) was beginning to harass her husband
further, by her words. </p>
