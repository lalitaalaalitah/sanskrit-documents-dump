<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 48</h3>


<p class="txt">Informed by the citizens of Rama's departure for the forest, when they returned to
Ayodhya after being unable to find out the tracks of his chariot, the wives of the citizens
reproach Kaikeyi and break into lamentation.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">The lives of those citizens, who had returned dejected and cheerless in this way
after accompanying Rama were greatly hurt, having their eyes filled with tears afflicted with
grief, longing to give up their lives and appeared as though they were dead. Reaching each his own
house, all of them surrounded by their sons and wife, shed tears, their faces being covered by
them. None was either delightful or merry. Merchants no longer exhibited their wares, nor their
merchandise looked charming. Those in charge of home did not attend to cooking. None was delightful
for instance on finding out a lost fortune, or on getting riches in abundance. No mother did
rejoice even on obtaining a son born for the first time.</p>
<p class="tat">Oppressed with sorrow and weeping, women in every house heaped reproaches on their
husbands who came home, with words as sharp as pricks of the goad which attack an elephant. "What
purpose of theirs who do not see Rama, will be served by their dwellings, wife or wealth or sons or
pleasures even? Lakshmana alone is a good man in this world, who was accompanying Rama belonging to
Kakutstha dynasty, along with Sita ,duly rendering service to them in the forest. Fortunate too are
the rivers; lotus ponds and lakes for bathing in whose sacred waters Rama entered into. Forests
with beautiful row of trees, tracks of land abounding in water, rivers and mountains with alluring
peaks will bring splendor to Rama. Any mountain or forest which Rama will visit, will not fail to
respect him like a beloved guest who has arrived. Plants with many-colored flowers as their
chaplets, bearing copious clusters of blossoms full of bees exhibit themselves at Rama. Even in
unseasonable ness, mountains in compassion will present principal flowers and fruits to Rama, on
his arrival. Mountains will show various wonderful waterfalls again and again, duly streaming forth
uncontaminated waters. Trees on apex of mountains will enrapture Rama. Where there is Rama, there
is neither fear nor humiliation. That Rama the son of Dasaratha, the hero and the mighty armed will
come to our view not far from us. Let us run after him. The shelter of the feet of the lord and the
high-souled Rama is in itself a joy. Rama indeed is the protector of all of us, he the refuge and
our supreme asylum. We shall serve Seetha, while you attend on Rama." Thus, the citizen's wives,
afflicted with agony, spoke in so many words to their husbands.</p>
<p class="tat">"Rama will secure the needs and interests of yours in the forest, while Sita will do
the same thing with regard to us womenfolk. Who will be highly pleased with this residence in the
city, which is apprehensible, with anxious people in it and not being a pleasant spot with
unsettled minds? If it were to be the rule of Kaikeyi, it will not be in consonance with
righteousness, with no protector and indeed with no use for our lives, mush less for our sons and
riches. Whom else Kaikeyi will not abandon? That Kaikeyi, by whom her son and her husband were
forsaken for the sake of power and who brought disgrace to her family. We swear even by our sons
that while Kaikeyi is surviving and as long as we live, we will never inhabit this kingdom as
Kaikeyi's servants! Who can live happily on having obtained (as one's ruler) that impious woman of
wicked conduct, who banished the son of the king without any pity? The whole of this kingdom,
without any leader, having no support and visited by calamities, will meet with ruin because of
Kaikeyi's fault. For, Rama having gone into exile, the monarch will not survive and when Dasaratha
is dead, utter regrets will remain thereafter. It is certain! So, drink poison duly stirred up,
since your merits are exhausted and you are marked out by ill fortune. Otherwise, follow Rama to
forest or reach a place where even the name of Kaikeyi may not reach your ears. Rama has been sent
to exile along with Seetha and Lakshmana deceitfully. We have been handed over now to Bharata, like
the beasts in the hands of a slaughterer. Rama, whose face is like the full moon, of dark brown
complexion, whose collar-bone is invisible (because of its being covered with flesh), a conqueror
of foes, whose arms descend to his knees, whose eyes resemble lotuses, the elder brother of
Lakshmana, who takes initiative in speaking and expresses with sweetness, truthful of speech and
possessed of extra ordinary strength, is benevolent to all, delightfully charming as the moon, that
tiger among men, as mighty as an elephant in rut, that great car-warrior, will surely adorn the
woods, while roaming through them."</p>
<p class="tat">Those wives of citizens in the city of Ayodhya, lamenting as aforesaid, began
weeping, as though fear has cropped up for a forth-coming death. The sun sank below the horizon and
the night fell, while the women in the houses were weeping in that manner about Rama. The city of
Ayodhya, in which the kindling of fires had ceased and the chanting of Vedas and narration of
sacred stories died out, looked as though it was coated with darkness at that time. The city of
Ayodhya, in which the business of the trading class had come to a stand-still, in which joy had
been faded out, which had become (now) support less, looked dim as though stars had disappeared in
the sky. The women whose minds became sick on account of Rama, as one would feel on one's own son
or brother having been sent into exile, cried miserably expressing their grief in various ways. To
them, Rama was dearer than their very sons! That city of Ayodhya, in which singing, rejoicing,
dancing and instrumental music had been completely set at rest, when jpy had departed forever and
whose shops had been closed, looked at that time like a grat ocean whose waters had dried up.</p>
