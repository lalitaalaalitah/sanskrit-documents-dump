<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 39</h3>


<p class="tat">Sumantra arranges for a chariot for the travel of Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana
at the orders of Dasharatha. Kingly ornaments are obtained for Seetha. Rama seeks blessings from
his mother Kausalya and others too. Kausalya's parting advises to Seetha.</p>
<p class="verloc"></p>
<p class="tat">Hearing Rama's words and seeing him clad in a garb of hermit, king Dasaratha with
his wives fell unconscious. Consumed by grief, he could not look towards Rama. Troubled in mind as
he was, the king could not speak to Rama by seeing into his face. The mighty armed Dasaratha was
unconscious for some time, distressed and repented in various ways thinking of Rama alone. "I think
that previously many people were separated from their children by me or in any case many living
beings were killed. Hence, this (calamity) has befallen me. Life does not decamp from the body
surely without the arrival of time. Death does not claim me, even being tormented by Kaikeyi and
even though I behold my son, effluent as fire, standing before me clad in the robes of an ascetic
having cast off his fine garments. All these people are suffering on account of only Kaikeyi, who
sought refuge in chicanery, with an implicit intent of selfishness."</p>
<p class="tat">Having uttered these words and saying "Oh, Rama!" only once, he was not able to
speak any more, his organs of voice being choked by tears. Regaining consciousness after a moment,
the king, with his eyes filled with tears, spoke these words to Sumantra: "You come with a chariot,
fit for driving, yoked with excellent horses and take this highly distinguished prince beyond this
territory. Since a pious and a valiant son is being sent to exile by father and mother, I think
such is said to be the reward of virtues of the virtuous."</p>
<p class="tat">Sumantra obeying the words of the king, walked away quickly and arrived there fitted
with horses, a chariot duly decorated. The charioteer told the prince with joined palms about that
chariot decorated by gold, fitted with superb horses. The king, who knew what should be done at a
proper place and time and was clear by all means, quickly called an officer placed in charge of the
treasury and spoke in a decisive tone (as follows): "Quickly bring for Seetha, clothing of great
worth and ornaments of high quality, taking into consideration all these years (that Seetha has to
spend in exile)." After thus spoken by the king, the officer went to the treasury, brought all that
in a lot and gave to Seetha. Setting out as she was to the forest, Seetha of noble birth adorned
her beautiful limbs with those wonderful jewels.</p>
<p class="tat">Seetha, beautifully adorned as she was, illumined that palace, as the sky in a
morning is illuminated by a rising sun. Embracing in her arms that princess of Smithfield, who
never behaved in self-pity, and smelling her head(as a token of affection), her
mother-in-law(Kausalya) spoke as follows: "Dishonest women, even though adored all the time by
their husbands, cease to esteem their husband who has come to pass into evil days, throughout this
world. Having enjoyed happiness in the past, they become spoiled and even desert their husband, on
obtaining even the least misfortune, such is the nature of (bad) women. Young women, who are
evil-minded, are untruthful in their disposition, are affected by passion and their essence,
incomprehensible. They get aversion within a moment. Neither a noble descent, nor an
accomplishment, nor learning, nor a gift nor even entertainment can capture the heart of women.
They are unstable of their heart indeed! But, for women established in good conduct, truthfulness,
sacred learning and mental quietness, their husband alone is the most sacred entity, the best of
all. My son who is being sent to the forest should not be despised by you. Even if he is invested
with riches or without riches, let him be a deity to you."</p>
<p class="tat">Perceiving her words, endowed with essence of righteousness and joining her palms,
Seetha replied to her mother-in-law standing in front of her, as follows: "I shall do just all
that, as your venerable self instructs me. I know how I should behave towards my husband. I have
also heard about it earlier. Your venerable self is not worthy of equating me with evil women. I am
unable to deviate from virtue, even as a moon from the moonlight. Vina (Indian lute) does not
resonate without chords. Chariot does not move without wheels. Now can a wife bereft of her
husband, even if blessed with hundred children, will not lie happily in comfort. A father indeed
gives a limited extent, a mother in a limited measure and a son in moderation. Which woman, then,
would not adore her husband, the bestowed of un limitedness! Having heard about the special and
ordinary duties of a wife from the most excellent women, how can I, as such, despise my husband, Oh
venerable lady? Husband is indeed a deity to women."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing Seetha's words, which touched her heart, Kausalya of pure mind suddenly
started shedding tears born of agony and delight. Rama, the most virtuous man, joining his palms,
approached and spoke these words to his mother, who is highly respected among all his mothers: "Oh,
mother! You do not grieve. You look after my father. The end of exile will come rather soon.
Fourteen years will elapse, while you are asleep. you as such, will see me, duly arrived here in my
entire being, surrounded by my well-wishers."</p>
<p class="tat">Uttering the aforesaid words of such quality and appropriate meaning to his mother,
Rama thought once again and gazed at his three hundred and fifty step-mothers. Rama joined his
palms and saluted those step mothers also, who were too distressed in the same way and spoke these
words which were in consonance with the spirit of righteousness. "Please excuse me, if I have done
any mistake either because of our living together or due to ignorance on my part. I now take leave
of you all." All those women, whose mind was overpowered with grief, heard the aforesaid cool
submission of Rama, which was in consonance with righteousness. While Rama was speaking thus, an
outcry, resembling the wail of female cranes arose from those wives of Dasaratha. His palace, which
was earlier resounding with tom toms, large drums and Meghas( musical instruments which sound like
rumbling of clouds) was now filled with wails and cries and fallen on evil days.</p>
