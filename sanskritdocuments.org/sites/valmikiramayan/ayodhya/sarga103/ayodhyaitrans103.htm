<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Rama fainted away, after hearing the news of his father's death and is brought back to consciousness by Bharata and others who
sprinkle water on him. Rama laments in various ways. Bharata consoles him. Rama in turn consoles Seetha who is weeping. Rama painfully reaches the
River Mandakini, offers water and balls of food to the spirit of his departed father and returns to the hut. The crying sounds of those brothers
mourning for their dad father with Seetha created and echo in the mountain. Hearing their cry of distress, the troops approach Rama, who receives
them all with affection.</p>
