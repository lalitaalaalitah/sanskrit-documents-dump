<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">King Dasaratha continued to narrate to Kausalya how he went to the aged parents of the deceased sage and informed about the death of
their son and its cause, how he escorted them to their son to the river where he was lying dead, how embracing the boy they wept and offered
libations of water to his spirit, how invested with an ethereal body, the spirit ascended to heaven while consoling the aged couple and finally how,
having cursed the king that he too would die of agony caused by the separation from his son, the aged couple gave up their lives. Having thus
narrated the story of his getting the curse long back and loudly weeping, king Dasaratha dies of grief.</p>
