<h3> <h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 68</h3>


<p class="txt">With the concurrence of Markandeya and other sages, Vasistha instructs messengers to
call back Bharata and Satrughna from their maternal uncle's house. The messengers leave immediately
for the capital of Kekaya, riding their fast horses. They cross Ganga River at Hastinapura, then
Saranda River and reach Abhikala village. Then, they cross the holy river of Ikshumati and proceed
through Bahlika kingdom in Sudama mountain range to Vishnupada and finally reach the city of
Girivraja.</p>


<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">Hearing their words, Vasistha replied thus to that group of friends as well as
ministers and to all the Brahmans (assembled there): "Bharata, who was given kingdom (by Dasaratha)
is staying very happily in his maternal uncle's home, along with Satrughna. Hence messengers in
fast running horses are to be sent quickly to bring back those heroic brothers. What are we to
think of further in this matter?"</p>
<p class="tat">Then all of them uttered words agreeing to send the messengers quickly. Hearing
their words, Vasistha spoke as follows: "O, Siddhartha! O, Jay anta! O, Vijaya! O, Ashoka! O,
Nandana! Please come. I am telling you all. Hear that which is to be done: After starting quickly
from here by traveling in rapidly running horses, you reach the city of Rajagriha. After relieving
yourself of the grief, you have to tell Bharata these words as my orders: 'The royal priest and
other ministers are asking about your welfare. Come forth, by starting quickly. There is a very
urgent work with you.' After going there, do not tell him that Rama has gone to exile or that his
father is dead or about this calamity occurred to the descendents of Raghu dynasty. Go quickly,
taking silk clothes and excellent ornaments to the king and to Bharata."</p>
<p class="tat">The messengers, who are going to leave for the land of Kekayas, took sufficient
eatables required on their way and went to their respective houses, by riding on their admirable
horses. Having completed all the remaining preparations for the journey and having been permitted
by Vasistha, the messengers quickly proceeded (to the destination). Those messengers went on
touching Malini River, flowing between the passing Aparatala Mountain and the northern end of
Pralamba Mountain. Having crossed Ganga River at Hastinapura, they proceeded towards west and,
reaching Panchala kingdom through Kuru Jangala and observing well filled lakes and rivers with
clear water, the aforesaid messengers went briskly, due to the pressing nature of their mission.
They speedily moved on, crossing the beautiful Saradanda River, containing clear water frequented
by various kinds of birds. Reaching a holy coastal tree called Satyopayaachana (so called because
prayers made to it become fulfilled); which was worthy of salutation and going round it clockwise
(as a mark of respect) the messengers entered the city of Kulinga. From there having reached a
village named Abhikala, they crossed the holy Ikshumati River, which was flowing down from
Bodhibhavana Mountain. This region was associated with the father and grandfather of Dasaratha.</p>
<p class="tat">Seeing Brahmans skilled in Vedas who survived by only drinking water through hollows
of their palms, they proceeded through Bahlika kingdom towards a mountain called Sudama. Perceiving
a locality called Vishnu padam, Vipasa river, Salmali trees, rivers, ponds, tanks, pools and lakes,
as well as seeing many kinds of lions, tigers, antelopes and elephants, they proceeded by that
broad lofty high way desirous as they were to execute the command of their master. Those
messengers, though riding on tired horses on a long route, reached quickly and safely to the
excellent city of Girivraja. For the sake of fulfilling the beloved object of their master
(Vasistha), for the sake of preserving the royal family and for keeping up the prestige of the
sovereign race, those messengers quickly and respectfully reached that city in the night.</p>
