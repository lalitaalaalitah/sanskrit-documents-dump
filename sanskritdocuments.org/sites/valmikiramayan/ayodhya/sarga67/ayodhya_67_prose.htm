<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga </h3>

<p class="txt">That night in Ayodhya passed over with agony. At sunrise the Brahmins who enthrone a 
person as a king, assembled and requested Vasista the family priest of Ikshvakus to select a youth to 
be crowned as a king of Ayodhya. They enunciated the various evil consequences of allowing the country 
without a king and leaving it in anarchy.</p>

<p class="verloc">----</p>

<p class="tat">That night in Ayodhya, which was joyless in a weeping tone and thronged with people with 
tears in their throats, slowly passed over. At sunrise, when the night had passed over, the Brahmins 
who place a king on the throne, together gathered at the assembly.</p>

<p class="tat">Markandeya, Moudgalya, Vamadeva, Kasyapa,Katyayana, Goutama and the greatly famous Jabali-all 
these Brahmans together with the ministers turned towards the excellent royal priest Vasishta and one 
by one spoke as follows: &quot;King Dasaratha having obtained death due to grief born of separation from 
his sons (Rama and Lakshmana), the night which burdened like a hundred years, has passed over with great 
difficulty. The monarch has gone to heaven. Rama took retreat in a forest. The brilliant Lakshmana followed 
suit and went along with Rama. Both Bharata and Satrughna, the annihilator of enemies, are encamped 
in the beautiful house of their maternal uncle in the city of Rajagriha in the kingdom of Kekaya. Hence, 
let anyone here in Ikshvaku dynasty be made a king today itself lest our nation without a king should 
result in a collapse indeed. Lightning clouds in the sky with a great noise of thunder, will not yield 
rain on the land in a country without a king. Even a fist of seeds are not disbursed in a ruler-less 
land. In anarchy, even a son is not amenable to the control of a father nor a wife in the authority 
of her husband. In a ruler-less land, there is no wealth. Where there is no king, there is no (faithful) 
wife. Another very dangerous thing is there. In a ruler less territory, how can there be truth? In a 
ruler-less country, people do not cause to make a delightful assembly nor erect beautiful parks or temples. 
In a ruler-less territory, those who frequently perform sacrificial rites, those who have self-restraint, 
those who firmly adhere to a vow as well as Brahmins do not carry out Soma sacrifices. In a ruler-less 
land, Brahmans who obtained wealth and sacrificers in great sacrificial rites do not bestow proper gifts. 
In such territory, festivals and gatherings exalting the kingdom in which actors, and dancers exhibit 
their talents are not frequently arranged. Litigants do not get their disputes settled and persons who 
have a knack for narrating stories do not gratify story- lovers with their tales. Girls adorned in gold 
do not go together to parks to play there in the evening. In a lord less land, lustful men do not go 
out to woods with ladies in speedily moving vehicles.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;In a lord less land, rich people living on agriculture and cattle rearing do not sleep 
in their abodes well protected, with their doors open. In a land without emperor, sixty year old elephants 
with bells tied around their tusks, do not roam around on royal high ways. In a ruler less land, the 
noise of plucking the bow string with the palm, produced by archers continuously discharging arrows 
while practicing the use of their bows, is not heard. Where, traders who go to distant places, carrying 
with them several merchandises, cannot travel safely in their voyages. A monk who wanders alone, who 
has subdued his senses, who mediates himself on the soul and who takes up an abode wherever evening 
overtakes him, cannot roam around the city. Where gain and security are not duly established. In anarchy, 
army cannot conquer enemies in battle. In a ruler-less land, people beautifully adorned, cannot go fast 
cheerfully in excellent horses and chariots. Where persons skilled in sacred treatises cannot sit speaking 
together in forests and groves. In such land, floral garlands, sweet-meats and gifts for the sake of 
offering to the deities, are not arranged by the appointed persons. Royal princes smeared with paste 
of sandal and aloe-wood do not figure brilliantly like trees in a spring time. &quot;A ruler-less country 
is like the water less rivers, like the lawn less garden and like the cowherd less cows. A flag is an 
identity for a chariot. A smoke is an identity for a fire. King Dasaratha, like a flag, was an identity 
for us and he has left the world for a heavenly abode. In a ruler-less land, there is no one&#39;s own property 
for any one. Like fishes, persons always eat away each other. The atheists, who were separated from 
their right path and who had been tormented; with punishment earlier by the king, are now without fear 
and are able to exercise their old temperament (due to anarchy) As the eye sight is helpful regularly 
for a proper setting -in-motion of the body, so also a king is the cause of existence for truth and 
righteousness of a country. The king is truthfulness and righteousness personified in him. In a race, 
he belongs to a noble family. The king is a mother and a father. The king is a benefactor to people. 
Hence, Yama (the god of Death); Kubera (the god of riches), Indra (the ruler of celestials) and the 
very mighty Varuna (the Lord of Waters) are outstretched by the a high and eminent conduct. Alas! If 
a king is not there in the world, with his power of discrimination between good and evil, this world 
will be dark and nothing will be clearly perceived. Even when the emperor was alive, we all of us did 
not transgress your words, only any more than an ocean transgresses its coast. O, the excellent Brahmana! 
After renewing the circumstances here and seeing that the kingdom is becoming a jungle without a king, 
you yourself anoint a youth born in Ikshvaku race or anyone here as a king.&quot;</p>
