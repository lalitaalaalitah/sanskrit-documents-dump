<h3 >Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 38</h3>

<p class="txt">Dasharatha is enraged to see his precious daughter-in-law in rags and takes Kaikeyi
to task. Rama seeks blessings of his father for departure and requests him to keep his mother
Kausalya, who is aging, comfortable.  </p>
<p class="verloc">- - - -  </p>

<p class="tat">On seeing Seetha wearing bark of trees like a helpless woman, even though protected
by her husband all the people there loudly cried out: "Fie upon you, Dasaratha!" Pained by that
loud cry there, King Dasaratha lost interest in his life, religious merit and esteem. Dasaratha
with a warm sigh, spoke to his wife these words. "Oh, Kaikeyi! Seetha does not deserve to go with a
robe made of Kusa grass. My preceptor truly says that Seetha, who is delicate young and ever
habituated to comforts, is not fit for forest-life. Has this pitiable daughter of Janaka, the jewel
of kings, done any harm to any one that, having obtained a bark of tree she is standing like a
hermits dumbfounded in the midst of men? Seetha the daughter of Janaka need not wear these barks of
trees. No such pledge was given by me earlier. Hence, let this princess go to the forest happily
fully provided with all valuable possessions. A cruel pledge has been made on oath by me, who do
not deserve to survive. This (providing robes of hermits to Seetha) has been initiated by you by
sheer childishness. That will consume me, as by its own flower a bamboo. Even supposing a little
offence is done by Rama to you, what harm was displayed to you here by Seetha? Oh, mean woman! What
harm on earth can be done to you by Seetha, who has blooming eyes like those of a female deer, soft
in disposition, a practicer of penance? Sending Rama to exile thus indeed is enough for you. What
use is there for you in further doing these wretched, sinful acts too. Hearing the speech you gave
to Rama who came here for coronation, only that much was acceded by me, Oh queen! Transgressing all
that, you somehow or other wish to go to hell, by perceiving Seetha also clad in bark of
trees."</p>
<p class="tat">That high-souled king thus lamenting, did not see any ending to that sorrow.
Drenched as he was in excessive devotion to his son and having been hurt very much, he fell down on
the ground. Rama, who was setting out to the forest, spoke these words to his father, who was
speaking thus bowing down his head, sitting there. "Oh, virtuous king! This glorious Kausalya, my
mother is aged. She is not of base nature and will not accuse you. You are worthy of amply
respecting her, who is deprived of me, who is immersed in an ocean of sorrow and who has not see
such an affliction earlier. Having been honoured by you the venerable man, she the pitiable woman
will not get such a grief for her son, thinking of me alone and she will draw breath in you. You
must see that my mother, who has high affection towards her son, will not depart to the house of
Yama the God of Death, by abandoning her life being emaciated by grief after my departure for the
forest."</p>
