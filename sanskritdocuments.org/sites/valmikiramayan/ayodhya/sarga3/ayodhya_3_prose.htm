<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 3</h3>


<p class="txt">Dasaratha, glad after hearing the words of assembled people, requests Vasishta and
Vamadeva to start arrangements for the anointing ceremony of Rama. Vasishta and Vamadeva order the
officers present there to make all arrangements, describing them in detail. Dasaratha then orders
Sumantra to bring Rama to the assembly. After letting Rama know of his desire, Dasaratha then
advises Rama on how to rule the kingdom for the benefit of the people.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">King Dasaratha, accepted their salutations with folded hands resembling lotus buds
and spoke good and agreeable words to them as follows:- "Oh! I am very much pleased and
incomparable is my fortune in that you desire my beloved elder son to be anointed as prince. "</p>
<p class="tat">King Dasaratha, thus duly returning the honor done by them, spoke while they were
listening, to Vasishta, Vamadeva and other Brahmans as follows: "This is the glorious and
auspicious month of Chaitra, in which the forests bloom with flowers. Let all arrangements be made
for the coronation of Rama as prince." While these words of the king were being completed, there
was a great delightful uproar of the people.</p>
<p class="tat">When their applause gradually subsided, King Dasaratha spoke the following words to
the best of sages, Vasishta. "Oh Divine Vasishta! Be pleased to order now for the traditional
ceremonial that is to be done and various accessories needed for the anointing ceremony of Rama."
</p>
<p class="tat">Vasishta, the best of Brahmans, hearing the words of king Dasaratha, ordered the
officers who stood there with folded hands before the king, as follows: - "Gather the following in
the sacred fire house of the king at dawn: gold and the like, diamonds, things needed to perform
worship, various herbs, white floral garlands, corn, honey and clarified butter in separate
vessels, new clothes, chariot, all weapons, the four divisions of army, an elephant with auspicious
signs, white fan, flag staff, white umbrella, one hundred golden pots with brilliant shine, bull
with gilded horns and a complete tiger skin".</p>
<p class="tat">"If any other small things are required, arrange for all of them. Let the doorways
of the royal palace and those of the entire city be worshipped with sandalwood paste, floral
garlands and good smelling incense. Let fine rice of good quality with milk and yogurt, fully
sufficient for one hundred thousand Brahmans be arranged. Let that rice be given with due respect
to important Brahmans tomorrow at dawn; along with clarified butter, yogurt, corn, and lot of
gifts."</p>
<p class="tat">"There will be an invocation for the well being of all, tomorrow at sun rise. Let
brahmanas be invited and suitable seats be arranged for them. Let the flags be hung and the royal
highways be sprinkled with water. Let well dressed dancers and musicians wait in second enclosure
in the royal compound. As worshipping is to be done in temples and at road junctions, let some
deserving people gather there with rice, eatables, presents and garlands separately. Let all the
warriors enter the well developed front yard of the royal palace with long swords, armors and clean
clothing."</p>
<p class="tat">Those wise men Vasishta and Vamadeva attentively ordered for all those things to be
done there, informed that to king Dasaratha and performed the remaining things also. Pleased and
satisfied with the arrangements made Vasishta and Vamadeva approached king Dasaratha and told him
that all had been done according to his words. </p>
<p class="tat">Afterwards, Dasaratha spoke to Sumantra "Let Rama, who has a disciplined intellect,
be brought by you immediately."</p>
<p class="tat">As commanded by the king, Sumantra brought there, Rama, the best of charioteers, in
a chariot. Afterwards the kings belonging to east, west, north, south as well as those belonging to
Mlechha kingdom, Aryaa Vartha kingdom and those ruling in hill and forest areas sat there and
attended on King Dasaratha as celestials attended on Devendra.</p>
<p class="tat">The sage king Dasaratha, sitting in the midst of those kings like Devendra in the
middle of the celestials, saw from the palace itself, his son Rama arriving in a chariot. Rama was
as beautiful as the king of Gandharvas. His valiance was world famous. He had great strength and
walked like a vigorous elephant. He had long arms, and with his enchanting face, he looked like the
moon. He stole the eyes and minds of the people by his looks, generosity and virtues. King
Dasaratha was thus not satiated enough in seeing Rama, coming like a cloud that gladdens people by
relieving them from the scorching summer heat. Sumantra helped Rama to get down from the excellent
chariot and with folded hands followed behind Rama, who approached his father. Rama, the best among
men, ascended the steps of the palace, which resembled Mount Kailaasa, along with Sumantra, to see
the king Dasaratha.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama with folded hands approached his father, bowed down mentioning his own name and
offered salutations to his father's feet. King Dasaratha took into his embrace that beloved son who
was standing humbly beside him with folded hands.</p>
<p class="tat">King Dasaratha gave Rama a great throne, which was high, excellent and beautiful,
decorated with gold and diamonds. Rama, occupying that great throne, caused it to shine with his
own brightness, just as the spotless sun in the morning causes Meru mountain to shine with
brilliance. Rama by his brilliance made that assembly to shine, just as the moon shines the clear
autumnal sky, with the dimless stars and planets. King Dasaratha was as delighted in seeing his
beloved son, as one delights in seeing oneself adorned, in a mirror. King Dasaratha, the best among
those who have sons, smilingly conversed with his son, and addressed Rama as follows, as Kasyapa
does to (his eldest son) Devendra (the ruler of gods).</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh Rama! You are an exemplary son born to my exemplary elder wife. Being excellent
in virtues, you are beloved son to me. As you with your good qualities cherished these people, you
get the princely kingdom on the day of Pushyami star (when the moon appears in conjunction with the
constellation Pushya).. Oh, son! By nature, you are very humble and virtuous. Even then, because of
my friendship with you, I can tell you this for your benefit. Be even more humble and always keep
the senses under control. Leave the bad habits born out of desire and wrath. Through direct and
indirect means, keep ministers and others happy. Like the celestials becoming happy after obtaining
the nectar, friends of a king (ruler of earth) are delighted when he fills the granaries and
armories to the brim, making the common people delightful and happy. Hence, you too act like
this."</p>
<p class="tat">The well -wishers of Rama, after hearing those words, intending to do good to
Kausalya, immediately came to her and informed the matter to her. The best among women, Kausalya
gave away gold, cows and different types of diamonds to those who informed her good news. Rama,
after offering salutations to king Dasaratha, ascended the chariot and went to his splendid house
after being worshipped by the crowds on the way.</p>
<p class="tat">Having heard those words of the king, seeing their dearest wish gratified, the
citizens took leave of the King Dasaratha and returned to their homes full of joy, in order to give
thanks and render homage to the Gods.</p>
