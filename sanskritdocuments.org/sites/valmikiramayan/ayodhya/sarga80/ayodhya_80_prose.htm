<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 80</h3>


<p class="txt">The engineers construct a comfortably high-way from Ayodhya to the River Ganga, by
clearing off shrubs and stones on the way and excellent wells were dug. Beautiful tents were also
built on the path.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">Then, those able to advise on the nature of soils, those skilled in thread-holding
for leveling purposes, those who were energetic courageous and attentive in doing their jobs,
excavators, mechanics, labourers, carpenters, road-menders, wood-cutters, hollow-makers, men
skilled in plastering and white washing, basket makers, tanners and skilled supervisors of work
sallied forth in advance. That mighty assembly of men gladly setting out to that forest was
splendid like an ocean on the day of the full moon having a gigantic commotion. Men skilled in
making roads, furnished with tools of every kin, seeking the company of men of their own proper
place, marched ahead. Clearing away rows of creepers and shrubs timber and big rocks as well as
variours kinds of trees (which obstructed the way), they carved out a path. Some men planted trees
in tree-less areas. Some others chopped the existing trees here and there by means of axes,
hatchets and sickles.</p>
<p class="tat">Some other strong men removed sturdy tufts of Virana grass and leveled the uneven
places here and there. Some others filled up wells and extensive pits with earth. Some men leveled
low-lying places all around. Then, some men bridged the steams that could be bridged, pulverised
the rocks that could be pulverised and smashed (the impediments that blocked the flow of water)
those which could be smashed. Many ponds, in various sizes and shapes containing plenty of water
resembling seas were built (by constructing dams on rivulets). In water-scarce areas, excellent
wells in various shapes were dug duly decorated all around with platforms (to rest). That track of
the troops, having its surface inlaid with cement, with flowering trees inlaid with cement, with
flowering trees on both sides, inhabited with birds in excitement making their sounds, adorned with
flags on its either side with its surface sprinkled with water of sandal-wood fragrance, and
decorated with various kinds of flowers, looked very much splendid like the path of celestials.</p>
<p class="tat">Those officers appointed for execution of the work, as ordered by Bharata,
skillfully instructed their work-men and erected a tent which was intended for the great-souled
Bharata, in a beautiful place abundant with tasty fruits. They further adorned profusely with
decorations, the tent which itself resembled on ornament. The connoisseurs erected the tents of the
high-souled Bharata at auspicious hours in days when the stars were propitious. Those camps, with
many breast works of sand, moats surrounding each of them, streets as resplendent as sapphires,
their crowns of terrets, the ramparts covered with stucco to protect then, the splendid banners,
the skillfully laid out avenues, lofty mansions the tops of which were provided with dove-cots,
which flew about as it were in the air and in splendour, resembled the capitals of Indra.</p>
<p class="tat">The route thus prepared, extended up to the Ganga River, whose pure and limpid
waters, abounding in great fish, flowed between woods and forests of every kind. That beautiful
royal high way, which was built gradually by efficient engineers, appeared as resplendent as a
night in a clear sky, illumined by the moon with its procession of stars.</p>
