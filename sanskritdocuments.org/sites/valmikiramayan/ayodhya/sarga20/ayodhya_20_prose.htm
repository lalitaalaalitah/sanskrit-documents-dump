<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 20</h3>
<p class="tat">Rama approaches his mother Kausalya to inform her of the calamity. Kausalya on
hearing the news, faints. On recovering, she laments in the most grievous tones to Rama.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">While Rama, the best of men, was leaving, after offering salutation to his father,
women in the palace were weaping loudly. " Which Rama, without being told by his father, used to do
necessary activities and protect the entire palace, is about to go to exile now Rama, since he was
born, was showing the same attention to us, as he was showing to his mother Kausalya. He used to
avoid actions which created anger and soothed all those who were angry. Rama was not furious with
those who abused him. Such Rama is going today to exile. Our stupid king by abandoning Rama who was
helpful to all beings , is offending all the beings.Thus, all the king's consorts while weaping
loudly, as cows which lost their calves, abused their husband . After hearing the terrific
distressful crying sounds in the palace, Dasaratha clung to the seat, with extreme anguish for his
son.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama, who was greatly hurt, sighed like an elephant, subdued his senses and went to
his mother's palace along with Lakshmana Rama saw a much worshipped old man sitting at the gateway
of the house and many others standing there. After seeing Rama, all of them rose quickly and
greeted Rama the most triumphant man, by uttering the words "May you have increased success! Rama
crossed the first gate and saw old Brahmanas who were perfect in Vedas and duly honoured by the
king.Rama offered salutation to those brahmanas and saw old women and girls, guarding the gate in
the third enclosure. Then those women, having delighted, greeted Rama with good word of success,
quickly entered the house and informed Kausalya about the lovely arrival of Rama .</p>
<p class="tat">At that time, Kausalya having spent the whole night with steadfastness, was
performing worship to Vishnu at dawn, for the welfare of her son. Kausalya, who was interested in
practising religious vows regularly, was appearing auspiciously in a white silk sari and was gladly
performing sacrificial ceremony in a sacred fire, by reciting vedic hymns. Then Rama entered his
auspicious mother's apartment and saw his mother performing sacrificial ceremony in a sacred fire
there.</p>
<p class="tat">There, Rama saw the articles of worship kept ready for the purpose of the sacred
ceremony like curd, unbroken rice, clarified butter, sweet meats, things fit for oblation, fried
grain, garlands made of white flowers, rice boiled in milk, mixture of rice and peas with a few
spices, sacrificial sticks, vessels full of water etc.</p>
<p class="tat">Kausalya, who became lean because of observance of vows, was shining like an angel
with her white silk sari and was satiating gods by presenting to them libations by water. By seeing
her son who came after a long time and who gave delight to mother, Kausalya was pleased and went
forward to meet him, like a female horse would run to meet her young colt. Rama offered salutation
to the approaching mother by touching her feet. Then, she took him into her arms and smelt his
head. Kausalya spoke these pleasing words affectionately to her son Rama, who was unassailable to
enemies:  "Obtain long life and glory, as obtained by the aged , the virtuous, the great souled and
the royal sages .Protect the righteousness engrained in your race . Oh,Rama ! King Dasaratha ,your
father is a man of true promise. Today itself, you will be installed as successor to the kingdom by
your virtuous father."</p>
<p class="tat">Kausalya asked Rama to take food , but Rama just touched the seat offered by her and
after performing salutation to her, spoke thus to his mother. That Rama , being humble in nature ,
became still modest due to respect for his mother and was set about to ask her permission before
setting forth his journey to Dandaka forest:  "Oh,mother! You do not know that a great dismay is
approaching now. It brings grief to you, to Sita and to Lakshmana. I am going to Dandaka forest.
Why is this seat for me? Time has come for me to sit on a seat made of Kusha grass. I shall live in
a solitary forest like a sage for fourteen years, leaving off meat and living with roots, fruits
and honey The great king is giving to Bharata the succession to kingdom and to me, however, he is
making me a sage to stay in the forest of Dandaka. I have to satisfy with the things existing in
the forest and subsist with roots and fruits in a solitary forest for fourteen years."</p>
<p class="tat">The queen Kausalya fell on the floor all at once like the branch of a tree, cut down
by an axe and as an angel dropping down from heaven.</p>
<p class="tat">Seeing Kausalya, who deserved to be free from sorrow, Rama lifted up her, who had
fallen unconsciously on the floor like a plantain tree. Rama touched with his hand that miserable
Kausalya,whose limbs were covered with fragrant powder and who rose like a loaded horse from the
floor on which it rolled from side to side.</p>
<p class="tat">Kausalya, who was fit for happiness but was afflicted with grief, spoke thus to Rama
the best of men who was sitting nearby, while Lakshmana was hearing.:  "Oh, Rama! I would not have
felt this much grief if I were childless .You are born only to produce sorrow to me. Oh, son! There
is no other grief to a barren woman except the only worry that 'I have no sons' Oh, Rama! I have
not seen any happiness or prosperity earlier, while my husband is in power. I believed that I could
see them at last when my son comes to power. I have to hear so many disagreeable words from my
fellow-wives who are inferior to me and who pierce my heart with their words though I am a better
and virtuous wife among them. Which one will be more sorrowful to women than this unending and
consuming grief that occurred to me now?"Even when you are near by, I am being rejected. What to
tell when you leave for exile? Death indeed is certain to me. My husband always held me down,
without giving me any independence and treated me equal to or even lower than the servants of
Kaikeyi. Those who serve me now and those who follow me, will not speak to me, after seeing Bharata
Oh, son! How can I, the miserable one, see the face of Kaikeyi who talks hurtingly because of her
continuous anger. Oh,Rama! I have been waiting for seventeen years after your second birth of
thread ceremony, with the hope that my troubles will disappear at one time or the other. Oh, Rama! 
In this old age, I cannot bear insult from co-wives and this unending sorrow for a long time. How
can I the pitiable one, spend this miserable life without seeing your face radiating like full
moon. You were nourished in vain by me , by fasts, by meditations, by various difficult and painful
vows .My heart is not breached, as bank of a great river, struck by new water in monsoon, by
hearing this news. That is why, I feel it is so strong. There is no death to me, indeed . I have no
place in the abode of god Yama who presides over the spirits of the dead. Hence, Yama is not
forcingly carrying me off like a lion carrying off a wailing antelope. This grief is inserted into
my body. Even then, my heart is stable. It has not broken into pieces and fallen on the floor. It
is indeed made of iron. There is no untimely death, it is certain. I feel bad since all my
religious vows, charities, restraints have all gone waste. The austerity I performed for the sake
of of f-spring has gone in vain, as a seed sown in a saline soil. If a man in great distress can
get premature death out of his own will, I being separated from you ,would have to   attain the
glory of the dead now itself like cow without the calf. Moreover, what is the use of life? Oh,
Rama! With your brilliant face shining like moon! My life is useless without you. I shall accompany
you to the forest like a weak cow going behind its calf"</p>
<p class="tat">Then, that Kausalya looked at Rama to whom a great calamity has occurred, saw her
son bound by grief and lamented very much in various ways like a Kinnara woman.</p>
