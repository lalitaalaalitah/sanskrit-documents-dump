<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 49</h3>


<p class="txt">Having traveled for a pretty long distance, Rama crossed Vedasruti, Gomati and
Syandika rivers. He presses forward in the chariot talking with Sumantra.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">Rama the tiger among men, revolving in his mind the command of his father, covered a
long distance during the rest of the night. While Rama was traveling with the same alacrity, that
delightful night passed away. Having worshipped the blissful morning twilight, he passed beyond the
boundary of that country. Seeing villages, whose outskirts have been tilled and the woodlands laden
with blossoms and hearing as follows the words of men dwelling together in the midst of the
village, Rama proceeded apace in those excellent horses as though slowly (engrossed as he was in
enjoying the sights).</p>
<p class="tat">Woe unto the king Dasaratha who fell into the clutches of concupiscence. "Alas!
Kaikeyi the cruel and the sinful one now is still engaged in a cruel game. She is sending to exile
the prince Rama, the pious man, the great intellectual, the compassionate man and he who subdued
the senses. That hot-tempered Kaikeyi is behaving in a rude manner, transgressing the bounds of
propriety. How Seetha the venerable woman, the daughter of Janaka, who was delighted always in
homely comforts can now experience hardships in the forest? What a surprise! The king Dasaratha,
having no love for his son, now wants to abandon Rama who is so beloved to the people and is even
faultless."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing these words of people residing in villages and hamlets, Rama the heroic
prince of Kosala crossed the boundaries of Kosala state. Having crossed the river of auspicious
waters called Vedashruti, Rama then stretched forth, facing the quarter occupied by Sage Agastya.
After traveling a pretty long time from there, Rama crossed the river Gomati having beautiful
waters, whose banks were adorned with cows and which headed towards the sea. Reaching the other
bank of Gomati river with the help of the swift moving horses, Rama crossed the river called
Syandika which had resounded with howls of peacocks and swans. The said Rama showed to Sita the
land (of Kosala, the southern boundary of which was defined by Syandika river)given long ago by the
king Manu to Ikshvaku and which was bounded by many territories.</p>
<p class="tat">The glorious Rama, the foremost among men, whose voice resembled the cackling of a
swan in rut, addressed the charioteer with great affection, in the words "Oh, charioteer!" and
spoke as follows : "When, coming back and united with my mother and father, shall I roam hunting in
the forest, bordering on Sarayu river and laden with blossoms? I do not hanker much after hunting
in the woodlands bordering on Sarayu river. In fact it is a delightful spot, made much of in the
world by hosts of royal sages. Hunting in the forest is indeed for gratification of royal sages in
this world. At times; the bow- men adopted it. But I do not long for it excessively."</p>
<p class="tat">Uttering in sweet voice to the charioteer on various topics dearer to him, Rama
advanced thus along that route.</p>

<h4>Thus completes 49th chapter in the AyodhyaKanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki,
the work of a sage and the oldest epic.</h4>
