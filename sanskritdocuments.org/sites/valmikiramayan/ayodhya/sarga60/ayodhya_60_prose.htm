<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 60</h3>

<p class="tat">Sumantra was unable to console Kausalya, who lied on the floor due to her extreme grief 
over her separation from Rama, even though he tries to avert her grief by telling her that Rama can 
reside in the forest delightfully, by warding off his agony.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - - </p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">Then, Kausalya, trembling again and again, as though possessed by a spirit, and lying 
on the floor without proper disposition of mind, spoke to Sumantra as follows: &quot;Wherever Rama, Seetha 
and Lakshmana are there, take me to them. Without them, I do not cherish to live here even for a moment.
Turn back the chariot quickly. Take also myself to the forest of Dandaka. 
Now, if I do not go after them, I shall enter the Death&#39;s abode.&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">Sumantra with joined palms and with a voice choked with tears and in faint accents, consoling 
Kausalya, spoke these words to her: &quot;Abandon grief, delusion and haste born of affliction. Rama can 
reside in the forest, warding off anguish. Lakshmana too, knowing about a righteous conduct, having 
subdued his senses and serving the feet of Rama in the forest, is propitiating the other world. Seetha, 
getting a dwelling  place resembling a house even in a lonely forest, 
her mind encamped in Rama and being fearless, is acquiring confidence. Not even very minute depression, 
even a little, is seen developed in Seetha. It appears to me as though Seetha is accustomed to so many 
exiles. Seetha is taking delight in the desolate forests in the same manner as she was earlier enjoying 
visiting gardens in the city. Seetha, a charming woman with her face resembling a full moon and with 
her mind absorbed in Rama, even though staying in a lonely forest, is enjoying it like a little girl. 
Seetha&#39;s heart is directed towards Rama. Her life also is dependent on him. Even if Ayodhya is without 
Rama, then it becomes a forest to her. As if only a couple of miles away from Ayodhya and as being in 
a garden there, Seetha on seeing villages, towns, movement of rivers, and various types of trees, enquires 
with Rama or Lakshmana and knows well about them. I am remembering only these incidents about Seetha. 
It does not flash to my mind now of the words hurriedly spoken of by Seetha about Kaikeyi.&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">Expunging the remarks spoken by Seetha about Kaikeyi coming almost nearer to his lips 
by inadvertence, Sumantra spoke only delightful and sweet words to Kausalya: &quot;Seetha&#39;s radiance resembling 
a moon&#39;s gleam is not fading away due to her travel in the forest or due to the velocity of wind or 
because of her bewilderment or due to heat of the sun. That face of altruistic Seetha resembling a lotus 
flower, whose lustre is similar to that of a full moon, did not become changed. Her feet, which even 
though no longer painted with vermilion, still looks red as Alakta (red juice obtained from resin of 
certain trees), with lustre equal to that of red lotus buds. Seetha, sporting her tinkling anklets, 
walks playfully. Even now, Seetha dons her ornaments, as a mark of her passion towards Rama. Seetha, 
who stays in the forest, takes refuge in the arms of Rama and hence does not give herself to fear, even 
by seeing an elephant or a lion or a tiger. There is no need to pity them nor us nor the king too. This 
story will thrive in the world forever. Abandoning grief, possessing cheerful minds, settling well in 
the path followed by great sages, delighting in the forest-life and eating fruits of the forest, they 
are keeping up the promise given to their father.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Even if averted thus by Sumantra, who is speaking appropriately well, being emaciated 
by sorrow for her son, could not stop crying, &quot;O, my dear son Rama!&quot; </p>
