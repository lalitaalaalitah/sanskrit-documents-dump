<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 12</h3>
<p class="tat">  Dasaratha is shocked by the strange wishes of Kaikeyi and tries to convince
Kaikeyi of her wishes as being harmful. Kaikeyi would not heed to the emperor's words.<br></p>
<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">After hearing the cruel words of Kaikeyi, King Dasaratha got disturbed and suffered
great agony for a while. "Is it a day-dream or a confusion of my mind? Or could it be an eclipse of
my experience or a disease of the mind? Thinking over thus, the king could not make out on the spur
of the moment what it was. Then, regaining consciousness, he felt tormented by Kaikeyi's words.
Distressed and dis-gusted  as he was as a deer at the sight of a lioness and seated as he was on
the bare floor, he gave forth a long sigh like a highly venomous serpent fixed to a charmed spot
through magic spells. Uttering words "what a pity!" the angry king fell into a swoon once more, his
mind infatuated with grief. Regaining consciousness after a long time and feeling much distressed
and angry, the King spoke thus to Kaikeyi, as though consuming her with fire in his eyes: "Oh cruel
woman of wicked conduct, inclined to exterminate this race! What wrong has been done to you by Rama
or by me? When Rama is treating you in the same way as his mother, why are you bent upon harming
only him? By not knowing you as a female snake with fiery poison, you were admitted by me as
princess in my house for my own self destruction. When all living beings extol the virtues of Rama,
for what offence shall I forego my beloved son? Supreme delight comes to me on seeing my eldest
son. My very consciousness is lost, if I fail to see Rama .The world can exist without the sun and
a crop without water. But life cannot continue in my body, without Rama. Oh, sinful woman! enough
of it. Let this resolution be given up. I even touch your feet with my head. Be gracious to me. Oh,
sinful woman! Why this most treacherous design has been conceived by you? If you wish to ascertain
my kindly or unkindly feeling towards Bharata, let it be so. But the observation made by you
earlier that glorious Rama, who is senior in the practice of virtue is my eldest son as it was,
must have been uttered in order to coax me or to get service from him. Afflicted with grief  by
hearing Rama's proposed installation, you are tormenting me too much. Possessed by an evil spirit
in a lonely house, you are subject to control of another Oh, queen!  In this Ikshhvaaku race, which
is rich in good conduct, this very great misfortune has appeared, due to which your mind has been
perverted.  Oh, large eyed one! Earlier you have not done anything unreasonable or repugnant to me.
That is why, I do not believe what has been done by you. Indeed, Rama is on par with the great
souled Bharata to you, for many times you were telling me stories illustrating this, Oh, young
lady! Oh, timid lady! How do you take delight in banishment for fourteen years of that pious-
minded and illustrious Rama? How do you take delight in the sojourn, in a most dreadful forest, of
Rama with very delicate body and having his self held in piety? Oh, the fair-eyed one! why do you
take delight in banishment of Rama, who is so pleasing to look at and who is so obediently doing
service to you ? Rama always is doing service to you more than what Bharata does. For that reason
also, in your case, I do not see any speciality in Bharata. In fact, who else other than Rama the
best of men could do much more service to you with respect, with correct notion and in obedience?
No censure or calumny against Rama can come from the mouth of many of thousands of women or from
numerous dependents maintained by me. Addressing gently all created beings with clear mind, Rama a
tiger among men, captivates the people of his kingdom by his kind actions. Rama the valiant,
conquers men by virtue, the poor through charity, the elders by service, the enemies in battle by
his bow. Truthfulness, charity, austerity, sacrifice, purity, straightforwardness, learning,
service to elders-these are firmly established in Rama. Oh, Queen! How do you wish harm to that
Rama who is richly endowed with honesty, who is equal to god and who is having splendour as of a
great sage? I do not remember an unkind word spoken by Rama, who always speaks kindly words to all.
As such, how can I for your sake, break unpalatable news to Rama the beloved. What recourse is
there for me other than Rama, in whom forgiveness, asceticism, self-denial, truthfulness, piety,
gratitude and harmlessness towards living beings exist."</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, Kaikeyi! You ought to bestow mercy to me, an old and miserable man who reached
his end and is coaxing painfully to you. Whatever can be attained on earth, which has the sea as an
end, all that I can give you. Let not anger take possession of you Oh, Kaikeyi ! I fold my hands in
salutation to you. I am even touching your feet. Be a protector of Rama. Let not unrighteousness
lay hold on me in this matter."</p>
<p class="tat">Then, that fierce Kaikeyi again spoke these fiercer words to Dasaratha, who was
burning with sorrow and was wailing as aforesaid, who had fallen unconscious and was tossing about
as he was filled with grief, and was praying again and again for being speedily borne across the
sea of grief.: "Oh, Valiant king! Having given boons, if you repent again and again how can you
proclaim piety on this earth? Oh, knower of what is right! When many royal saints assemble and
converse with you , what will be your reply? Can you say a wrong was done to Kaikeyi, on whose
grace I am living now and who protected me earlier? Oh, King! You having granted boons indeed
today, now talk in another way, creating blemish on other kings.When there was a dispute between a
hawk and a pigeon (who were no other than Indra the ruler of gods ,and the god of fire
respectively), the ruler of Sibis* gave away his own flesh to the bird and king Alarka** by parting
with his eyes, attained to the highest destiny.</p>
<p class="tat">* Ruler of Sibi: We are told in our scriptures how in order to put the large
-heartedness of the king to a test, Indra(the ruler of gods)and Agni (the god of fire) once
appeared in his court in the disguise of a hawk and a pigeon. Being chased by the hawk, the pigeon
which sought the king's protection, descended into his lap. The hawk which closely followed it,
demanded it back from the king, contending that the bird had been allotted to it as its food by
providence and the king had no right to rob it of its quarry. The king, however was not prepared to
forsake the fugitive on any account and agreed to part with his own flesh in order to indemnify the
hawk. The hawk however out weighed the king's flesh every time he chopped it from his body till at
last he ascended the scale himself and thus offered himself in exchange for the pigeon.
**Alarka=The royal sage Alarka parted with his own eyes in order to implement a boon granted by him
to a blind Brahmana who asked for the king's eyes in order to have his own eyesight restored.The
ocean, having given a promise, never crosses its limits. Therefore, bearing in mind the previous
occurrences, do not violate the pledge given by you to me Oh, the evil-minded ! By giving up
righteousness and by installing Rama in the kingdom, you want to enjoy life with Kausalya
forever".</p>
<p class="tat">"Let it be unrighteous or righteous, real or hoax. There should be no change in
whatever is promised by you for me If Rama is coronated, I shall indeed die before your eyes by
drinking abundant poison now itself in front of you. If I have to see Kausalya, the mother of Rama
receiving salutations even for a day, death is indeed better for me. Oh, King! I swear to you an
oath by Bharata and by myself that I will not be pleased with anything else other than sending Rama
to exile."</p>
<p class="tat">Kaikeyi spoke words of such extent and stopped. She did not further reply to the
wailing Dasaratha.</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing Kaikeyi's boons, asking for Rama's exile and Bharata's sovereignty which are
very much unwelcome, king Dasaratha nevertheless was perturbed for a while and did not move his
lips towards Kaikeyi. He kept gazing with unwinking eyes towards his beloved queen Kaikeyi, who
spoke such disagreeable words. The king could not become comfortable on hearing that utterance,
which was unkindly to his heart filling with pain and sorrow and was as terrible as a
thunderbolt.</p>
<p class="tat">Reflecting over Kaikeyi's resolve and her terrible swearing, Dasaratha heaved a
sigh, uttered "Rama"  and fell like a tree which was cut off.</p>
<p class="tat">Then the king became like a mad man who lost his equilibrium, like an ailing man
getting upset and like a serpent losing its fiercfuleness.</p>
<p class="tat">Then the king spoke to Kaikeyi in a distressed tone as follows : "By whom have you
been taught this worthless thing which appears to be worthwhile? Like a woman whose mind has been
perverted by an evil spirit, you are not ashamed to speak to me. In the beginning, I was not
knowing your wavery conduct in this way. But now, I am seeing it in you. It is perverted.From whom
has such fear cropped up in you, so as to seek Bharata to be seated on the throne and Rama to stay
in the forest? If you want to do favour to your husband, to the world at large and to Bharata, you
give up this sinful intention of sending Rama to exile Oh, cruel petty minded woman of sinful
resolve and wicked deed! Which grievance or offence are you finding in me or in Rama?With out Rama,
Bharata will not in any case take possession of the kingdom of Ayodhya as I think him to be
stronger in virtue than even Rama. Having uttered the words 'proceed to the forest! ', how can I
behold the pale face of  Rama resembling an eclipsed moon?"</p>
<p class="tat">"How can I see that reasonable scheme of mine, which was well made in consultation
with friends and duely decided, foiled like an army destroyed by enemies? What the kings who came
from many directions, will speak about me? 'Alas, this king Dasaratha, a fool was ruling this
kingdom for such a long time!' When many virtuous and learned elders enquire me about Rama, what
then shall I tell them? Even if I tell the truth that Rama was sent to forest by me, hard-pressed
as I was by Kaikeyi, nobody will believe it and think it as untruth. What will Kausalya say to me
if Rama proceeds to forest? What can I, having done an unkind act, reply to her? Oh, Kaikeyi!
Whatever Kausalya, who was always desirous of showing kindness to me, who was blessed with a pet
son, who speaks kind words and who deserves to be kindly treated, was waiting on me like a
maid-servant, like a friend, like a wife, like a sister and like a mother. But, for your sake, she
was never treated kindly by me. That which was done good by me for you, is hurting me now even as a
meal taken with forbidden sauces fills an ailing person with repentance. Being apprehensive of
seeing Rama being treated with contempt and sending him on exile to the forest, how will Sumitra
put faith in me? Sita, alas, will hear woefully two unpleasant  incidents viz.; of me having
befallen to death and of Rama seeking refuge in the forest. Alas! Like a Kinnara girl bereft of her
partner at the side of Himalayan hill, Sita with her grief will make me lose my life. Seeing Rama
dwelling in a great forest and Sita lamenting, I cannot indeed desire to live. Oh, Kaikeyi!
Deprived of your husband, you can as such rule the kingdom along with your son. It is indeed
impossible for me to survive, after Rama's exile. I considered you, a good and virtuous wife as you
are, proving to be perpetually bad wife as one, having drunk wine mixed with poison, though
possessing an attractive appearance, concludes it to be obnoxious. You used to speak to me very
consolingly with untruthful gentle words like a deer being killed by a hunter after enticing it
with melodious sounds. Venerable people gathered in the streets will reproach me who has sold away
my son, saying that I am as bad as a brahmana who drinks wine. It is certain. Alas! How distressing
and how painful it is that I have to forbear your words! I got this type of trouble as an evil
consequence earned in a previous life.  Like a rope used for hanging up one's neck through
ignorance, Oh sinful woman, you have been   maintained by me lovingly, sinful as I am. Enjoying
life with you , I could not recognise you as cause of my death. I touched you, like cobra touched
with hand by a child in a deserted place. This world of living beings is certainly fit to curse me,
such as I am, saying that Rama the great souled is deprived of fatherly protection by me, the
evil-minded and alas! extremely foolish is king Dasaratha, whose mind is lustful for a woman and
who sent his son to the forest. Emaciated by vows, by study of Vedas and by service to his
preceptors, Rama will indeed (even) during his period of enjoyment, again undergo a great hardship.
My son Rama is incapable of saying a second word to me to go to forest, he will say 'Be it so!'  If
Rama does contrary to my command to go to forest, it will be most welcome to me. But, Rama the
darling would never do so. Rama, who is pure minded, cannot indeed conjecture my way of thinking.
Having been told to go to the forest, he will say 'Be it so'.On Rama reaching the forest, Death
will take me, who is condemned by all men and unpardonable, to the abode of Yama the god of
punishment.Rama the foremost among men-having left for the forest and I having been dead, what
sinful act can you think of the remaining people beloved of me. The queen Kausalya, after losing
me, Rama and sons Lakshmana and Satrughna, will be unable to endure the woes and will follow me to
the abode of Yama. Having thrown Kausalya, Sumitra along with three sons and myself into tortures
of hell, you be happy! Being abandoned by me and Rama, the Ikshhvaaku dynasty which was eternal,
which was adorned with qualities, which could not be disturbed, will now be protected by you by
bringing disorder. If it becomes agreeable to Bharata to send Rama to exile, let not Bharata do
funeral rite to me , when my life has departed. Alas! my adversary! Oh, vulgar lady, Kaikeyi!
Become satisfied with your desires! When I am dead consequent on Rama, the foremost of men, having
proceeded to forest, you a widow along with your son will then rule over the kingdom. You are
residing in my house with the designation of a princess. All ill-fame, which is unequalled in this
world and lasting insult as well as disrespect of men will fall to my share as to a perpetrator of
sinful deeds. How can My beloved son Rama, who was hitherto travelling as a Lord time again in
chariots elephants and horses, will move on foot in a great forest? How will my son, in whose
dining time, cooks wearing ear-rings used to prepare excellent food and drinks, trying to finish
their work before others - actually survive by eating astringent bitter and pungent wild foods?.
How having worn costly robes, will Rama who is deserving of lasting comforts, be in brown-red
clothing on this earth? Whose terrific and thoughtless words are these, of one demanding Rama's
exile to forest and the other of Bharata's consecration as king?Women of course are deceivers and
even occupied with selfishness. Let them be condemned!  Here, I am not mentioning of all women but
of Bharata's mother only. Oh, cruel woman of evil intent, given to pursuit of your selfish ends
!You have a settled disposition to bring grief  to me. What a mischief do you expect through me or
through Rama, who is always doing benefit to you? On seeing Rama plunged in adversity fathers leave
of their sons and wives too their husbands .Nay, even the entire world gets exasperated. I, for
one, rejoice by seeing that son Rama in the form of a divine boy, adorned with ornaments coming in
proximity to me. By seeing him again and again , I get rejuvenated"</p>
<p class="tat">"Active life may be possible even without sun or even Indra (the wielder of thunder
bolt) not pouring rain. But, my opinion is that not even one will survive, by seeing Rama departing
from here. I lodged in my house, as one would one's own mortal enemy, you, who seek my destruction
and are unfriendly. Alas, due to ignorance, a highly venomous female serpent has been held on my
lap so long and therefore I am undone . Bereft of me as also Rama and Lakshmana, let Bharata along
with you, rule over the city and the state. After killing your relatives, bring delight to my
enemies. Oh, cruel natured! One who has struck a blow in adversity! When you violently utter such
words now, why the teeth from your mouth have not fallen down, breaking into thousands of
pieces?"</p>
<p class="tat">"Rama does not speak a word which is even a little malevolent or unkindly. He does
not know how to utter harsh words. How indeed are you recounting the faults of Rama, who talks
beautifully and who is always admired for his virtues"</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, Kaikeyi, the black guard of Keka dynasty! You may faint away or flare up or
perish or enter the earth split up into thousands of cracks! I will not act on your word which is
very cruel and inimical to me."</p>
<p class="tat">"I do not wish the survival of you, who are destructive like a razor, always
speaking falsely pleasing words, are of evil natured, disastrous to the family, intent upon burning
my heart along with vitals and repellent to my mind"</p>
<p class="tat">"There is no life to me without my son. How can there be happiness moreover? From
whom else can there be joy , while I survive? Oh, queen! You ought not to do an unfriendly act to
me. I even touch your feet. Be gracious to me."</p>
<p class="tat">That king, who has been gripped in the heart by his wife, who transgressed all
bounds of decorum , wailing like a forlorn child and not reaching Kaikeyi's both the feet which
were spread along , sank down like an ailing man.</p>
