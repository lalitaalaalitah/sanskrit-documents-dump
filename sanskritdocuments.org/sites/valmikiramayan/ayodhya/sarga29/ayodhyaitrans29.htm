<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Seetha implores upon Rama to allow her to come to forests, and says that she heard through some foretellers that she has to live in
forests for some time, when she was with her father's place. But Rama is not interested to make Seetha's life penurious in forests and once again
tries to pacify her. He asks her to stay back at Ayodhya. For that Seetha laments to become lonely parted with her husband.</p>
