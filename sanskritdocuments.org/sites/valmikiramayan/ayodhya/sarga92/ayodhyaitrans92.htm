<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Bharata approaches the sage Bharadwaja and seeks his permission to leave. Bharata asks Bhardwaja the exact route by which he can reach
the abode of Rama. Bharadwaja gives the details of the path towards the banks of river Mandakini, situated at the north of Chitrakuta mountain, where
Rama is stationed along with Seetha and Lakshmana. Hearing of the journey, Dasaratha's wives approach Bharadwaja and offer their salutations to him.
Bharata introduces his mothers one by one to Bharadwaja. While introducing his mother, Kaikeyi to Bharadwaja, Bharata describes Kaikeyi as the
root-cause of their family's misfortune. But, the sage Bharadwaja consoles him, saying that the exile of Rama would ultimately result in happiness
the sages, celestials and even the demons. Bharata finally bids farewell to the sage and proceeds to Chitrakuta, along with his retinue.</p>
