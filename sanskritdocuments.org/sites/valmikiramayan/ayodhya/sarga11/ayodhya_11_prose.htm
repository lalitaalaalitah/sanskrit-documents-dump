<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 11</h3>
<p class="tat"> In this chapter Kaikeyi asks King Dasaratha to fulfill the boons given to her in
earlier times.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - - </p>
<p class="tat">Kaikeyi spoke the following harsh words to that king, who was struck by cupid's
arrows and yielded to hasty lust:</p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, King! no body has insulted me, nor despised me. But I have a certain desire
that needs to be fulfilled by you. If you wish to fulfil my desire, you first promise to fulfil it.
After your promise I shall inform you that which is desired by me."</p>
<p class="tat">The most majestic and lustful Dasaratha smiled a little and caressingly kept his
hand into her hair and spoke these words to Kaikeyi who was having white smile in her face: "Oh,
proud woman! Don't you know that there is nobody on this earth more dearer to me than you except
Rama, the best among men. Rama cannot be defeated by enemies. He is a very important person in our
family. He is the supporter of life and a high souled man. I take oath by him. Tell me what is
desired by you. Oh, Kaikeyi ! I can't live even for a moment without seeing Rama. This is certain.
By that Rama, I am taking my oath and promising to fulfill your word. I desire the well being of
Rama, the best of men, even at the cost of my life or the lives of my other sons. I take oath by
that Rama and tell you that I shall fulfil your word . Oh, auspicious lady! My heart is sinking.
You raise it by your touch. Oh, Kaikeyi! you observe all this and tell me that which you think as
good. You need not doubt me as you know your authority over me. I am taking oath on my
auspiciousness. I shall do whatever is desired by you."      That Kaikeyi, who had utmost desire
for coronation of  Bharata and for sending Rama to exile, revealed that wish from her mind, uttered
unspeakable words with bias and  delighted as she was with Dasaratha's words, conveyed  to him as
follows of the very horrible wish in her mind as conveying the news of a suddenly befallen death
standing at his door: "Let thirty three celestials with the god of Fire in the forefront hear your
words giving boons to me, preceded by series of your oaths. Let your words be heard by sun, moon,
sky, planets, day, night, the four quarters, universe, earth, celestial musicians, demons, spirits
wandering in nights , house-gods and other spirits. King Dasaratha, who has true promise, who has
great valour, who knows righteousness and who has good equanimity of mind, is giving boon to me.
Let the celestials hear it for my sake."</p>
<p class="tat">Kaikeyi made Dasaratha to hear these words, praised him too much and thereafter
spoke these words to him who was ready to give boons as he was infatuated by lust: "Oh, King!
Remember what happened in the battle between celestials and demons earlier. There the enemy
destroyed almost every thing except your life. Oh, King! There, I saved you. Hence you gave boon to
me who was so attentive in trying to save you. Oh, King! The protector of the Earth, the one who
has true promise! I am hunting for those boons, which were given by you and kept with you for safe
custody. You have to give that boon, as per right, to me as promised by you. If you despise me by
not giving it, I should abandon my life now itself".</p>
<p class="tat">Dasaratha, after having thus yielded in full measure to kaikeyi's words, fell into
her trap as a deer, for his self destruction.</p>
<p class="tat">There-afterwards, Kaikeyi spoke these words to Dasaratha who was ready to give boons
and who was infatuated by lust: "Oh, King! the lord of Earth!Now only I am asking for those boons
which were given by you then. Listen to my words".</p>
<p class="tat">"All arrangements have been made to undertake Rama's coronation. Let my Bharata
instead be coronated on this occasion itself".</p>
<p class="tat">"Now, the time has arrived for the second boon given by you affectionately then in
the battle between celestials and demons. Rama has to take refuge in the forest of Dandaka for
fourteen years and let him become an ascetic wearing rags, deer skin and matted hair".</p>
<p class="tat">"Now itself, Bharata has to get rights of succession to kingdom, which is free of
enemies. This is my greatest desire. Now I am asking for the boon given by you earlier. Oh King of
the Kings, Dasaratha ! Be true to your promise and protect your caste, character and birth. Are not
the ascetics telling that for human beings to get happiness in another world, they have to speak
only the truth.?"</p>
