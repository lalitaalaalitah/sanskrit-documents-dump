<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Bharata asserts that he does not know how the exile of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana has occurred. Bharata and Satrughna go to Kausalya's

by him. Bharata politely explains, on a number of oaths, his own innocence over the matter, Kausalya comes to know Bharata's heart, fondly takes him
to her lap and weeps distressfully.</p>
