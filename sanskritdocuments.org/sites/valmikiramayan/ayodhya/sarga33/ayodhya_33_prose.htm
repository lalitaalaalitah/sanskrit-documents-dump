<h3 >Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 33</h3>
<p class="tat">Rama while going to his father at Queen Kaikeyi's palace listens the people's
voice of sorrow for his exile. They sadly express their heartfelt feelings. On reaching the palace,
Rama bids Sumantra to inform Dasharatha about his arrival for paying respects at the time of
departure.</p>

<p class="tat">Rama and Lakshmana along with Seetha gave away abundant riches to brahmanas and went
along with Seetha to see their father. Those weapons held by Rama and Lakshmana were tied on with
garlands by Seetha. The weapons thus decorated were shining brilliantly and were fearful to look
at. Then, wealthy people ascended lofty palatial mansions, large buildings and tops of palaces of
seven stories high and saw them spiritlessly. The streets were indeed difficult to walk, congested
as they were, with many men. For that reason, being in distress, they were seeing Rama by ascending
lofty palatial buildings.</p>
<p class="tat">Then, by seeing Rama as a pedestrian without an umbrella, the people with their
hearts struck by grief were uttering words of many sorts. The same Sri Rama who was followed by a
strong four wings of army(comprising elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry), is walking lonely
with Seetha followed by Lakshmana. Rama knew the taste of sovereignty. He can grant desires to the
desirous. Even then, because of his respect for virtue, he is careful not to belie his father's
words. Even people walking on road are able to see Seetha, who could not earlier be seen even by
beings going through the air. Rain, heat and cold will quickly wane to pallor Seetha, who was fond
of applying suitable cosmetics and red sandal to the body. Today, certainly Dasaratha is talking,
by identifying himself with some evil spirit. the king is indeed not entitled to send his
affectionate son to exile. How banishment can be affected on a son, even devoid of virtues? Why to
tell further of whom, this world is conquered merely by his mode of conduct? Harmlessness,
compassion, learning, good nature, self-control and tranquillity - these six virtues adorn Rama,
the best of men. Therefore, people are extremely painful for the injury done to him, as aquatic
beings in summer are afflicted because of depletion of water.</p>
<p class="tat">The entire world feels afflicted by the hardship inflicted on this protector of the
world, as a tree which acquired flowers and fruits is damaged by injury caused to its root. This
Rama, the essence of virtue possessing great lustre, is indeed the root of the tree of humanity.
Other men are his flowers, fruits and branches. We as such along with our wives and relatives
atonce will follow Rama in the same way as Lakshmana is going with the departing Rama. Abandoning
gardens fields and houses, we shall follow Rama the righteous man, and share his joys and sorrows.
Let Kaikeyi obtain the houses deserted by us, their treasures unearthed, their court-yards in
ruined state, their wealth and food grains removed, their best parts robbed off from all sides,
covered by dust, deserted by the deities(presiding them), overrun by mice, coming out of their
holes and turning round here and there, without water and smoke, unswept, the rites of offering
oblations to all creatures as well as the sacred fire, worship of gods, the chanting of sacred
texts and muttering of prayers having altogether ceased, as though dilapidated by adverse times and
scattered with broken vessels. As Rama is going away to the forest, let that forest become a city
and let this city being deserted by us become a forest. Scared by fear of us, let all the snakes
abandon their holes, the deers and birds the mountain peaks, the elephants and the lions the forest
itself. Let them leave the region going to be inhabited by us and reach the city of Ayodhya. Let
Kaikeyi with her son along with her relatives indeed inhabit the region where ferocious animals and
vultures live with grass, meat and fruits. Let us all (on the other hand) live happily in the
forest along with Rama. Rama heard various kinds of remarks thus made by many people. Hearing them
also, his mind was not disturbed. That Rama the virtuous man, by walking with strides of an
elephant in rut, approached his father's palace, which from a distance glowed like a peak of the
Kailasa mountain. After entering the royal palace, which had in it disciplined and valiant
attendants, saw Sumantra standing dejected not far from the palace. The, Rama even on seeing the
people disturbed, appeared unmoved and smiling, intending to fulfill his father's behest and went
to see his father. Seeing Sumantra appearing disturbed before that, Rama the son of Dasaratha( a
scion of Ikshhvaaku) whose mind is mighty and who is setting out to the forest, waited awhile to
have his presence announced to his father. That Rama, who had passion towards piety, having made up
his mind positively to enter the exile as per his father's  command, spoke thus, seeing Sumantra,
"Inform my arrival to the king."</p>
