<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 108</h3>

<p class="txt">A Brahmana named Jabali tries to persuade Rama to accept the kingdom by advocating the 
theory of Nastikas (non-believers), saying that he need not get attached to his father&#39;s words and remain 
in the troublesome. Jabali requests Rama to enjoy the royal luxuries, by accepting the crown.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - </p>

<p class="tat">A Brahmana called Jabali spoke the following unrighteous words to Rama, who knew righteousness 
and who was assuaging Bharata as aforesaid. &quot;Enough, O Rama! Let not your wisdom be rendered void like 
a common man, you who are distinguished for your intelligence and virtue. Who is related to whom? What 
is there to be obtained by anything and by whom? Every creature is born alone and dies alone. O, Rama! 
He who clings to another, saying, &#39;This is my father, this is my mother, he should be known as one who 
has lost his wits. There is none who belongs to another.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O, Rama! As one who passes the a strange village spends the night the and the next day 
leaves that place and continues his journey, so are mother, father, home and possessions to a man; they 
are but a resting place. The wise do not become attached to them. O, chief of men! You as such should 
not abandon your father&#39;s kingdom in order to dwell in a lonely forest, that is excruciating hard to 
traverse and full of thorny thickets. Get yourself crowned in the prosperous kingdom of Ayodhya. That 
city is waiting for you, with your locks duly unfound.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O, prince! Enjoy the royal luxuries worthy of you. Move around in Ayodhya as Indra the 
Lord of celestials does in heaven! Dasaratha is none to you nor you in anyway to him. That king is another 
and your are another. Hence, do what is told by me? The father is only the seed of a being. The sperm 
and the ovum blend at the right time in the mother&#39;s womb, so that a human being is born in this world. 
The king has gone, where he had to go. This is the fate of all being unnecessarily, you are still frustrated 
over the matter. I pity all those whosoever, devoted to wealth and religious merit, not other (who are 
devoted to sense-enjoyment), for, they, having undergone suffering in this life, have met with extermination 
after death.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;These people say, &#39;The eighth day should be given up to sacrifices for the spirits of 
our ancestors.&#39; See the waste of food. What will a dead man eat? If food eaten by one here, reaches 
another&#39;s body, then let a sacrifice be offered for those who are setting out on a distant journey. 
Will it not become a food on their path? Perform sacrifices, distribute gifts, consecrate yourselves, 
practise austerity and renunciation&#39; - These writings are composed by learned men for the sake of inducing 
others to give. O, the highly wise! Arrive at a conclusion, therefore, that there is nothing beyond 
this Universe. Give precedence to that which meets the eye and turn your back on what is beyond our 
knowledge. Honour the judgment of the wise and regarding that which is approved by all, accept the kingdom 
as propitiated by Bharata.&quot;</p>
