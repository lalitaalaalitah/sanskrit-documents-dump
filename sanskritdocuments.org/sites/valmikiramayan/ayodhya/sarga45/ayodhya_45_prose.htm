<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 45</h3>


<p class="txt">Rama requests the citizens to return to Ayodhya and to show respect to Bharata the
prince Regent and Dasaratha the king. The citizens try to persuade Rama to return to Ayodhya, but
in vain. Rama along with all of them reach the bank of Tamasa.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">The people devoted to the high- soled Rama of unfailing bravery accompanied him on
his way to the forest for exile. When the king was forced (in the interests of his son) to turn
back, the group of friends who were following Rama's chariot did not return. Rama who enjoyed great
celebrity and who was richly endowed with every virtue, resembling the full moon, had indeed become
the favorite for the people living in Ayodhya. Despite the entreaties of the people of his own,
Rama(the scion of the Kakutstha), in order to honour his father's vow; proceeded towards the
forest. Fondly gazing on the people as though drinking with his eyes, Rama lovingly spoke (as
follows) as though they were his own children: "The respect and affection that has been bestowed
upon me by you (the residents of Ayodhya) may for my satisfaction be bestowed in a special measure
on Bharata. He who enhances the delight of Kaikeyi and who possesses excellent conduct, will indeed
do pleasing and beneficial things to you appropriately. Bharata who is matured in knowledge but
young in age, who is gentle but endowed with virility and virtue, will become your worthy master
who can dispel your fears. Bharata who is endowed with royal virtues is being marked as the prince.
Further, king's command is to be carried out by me and the rest of you. If you desire to please me,
see that the king does not suffer agony when I have gone to forest for exile"</p>
<p class="tat">The more Rama the son of Dasaratha, showed himself to be faithful to his duty, the
more the people wished to have him as their master. Rama accompanied by son of Sumitra, drew the
people of the city, who were weeping piteously, after him as if tied and pulled with cords. Those
brahmanas, who were triply revered for their learning, their age and their spirituality, their
heads shaking with advanced years, cried out : "Oh Noble Steeds, of speedy breed! You who are
carrying Rama, do come back! Do not proceed! Be friendly to your master (since by taking Rama
against our wishes, you will be doing a disservice to him). Indeed all things, which are endowed
with ears, more so horses, stand appraised of our entreaty. Therefore, you return. That hero of the
pure soul, of virtuous and auspicious firm resolve, that master, deserves to be brought back to the
city and not to be taken to the forest."</p>
<p class="tat">Seeing those aged brahmanas uttering those painful words, Rama quickly got down from
the chariot. Rama with Sita and Lakshmana, taking close strides, proceeded on foot towards the
forest. That Rama who was affectionate in his disposition and had compassion in his eyes, could not
abandon those brahmanas walking on foot, far behind the chariot. Perceiving Rama still going
towards the forest, those brahmanas perplexed in mind and greatly distressed, spoke the following
words : "The whole of this brahmana community is following you, devoted (as you are) to the
brahmanas. See, they are bearing the sacred fires on their shoulders. Look at these canopies
(obtained by us while observing Vajpeya sacrifice*) accompanying our backs like clouds at the end
of the rainy season"</p>
<p class="comment">*-It is laid down in the Vedas that he who performs a Vajpeya sacrifice must be
supplied with a white canopy.</p>
<p class="tat">"With these canopies of ours, we shall give shade to you, who have got no canopy and
are being scored with rays (of the sun.) Oh, Dear child! The intellect of ours, which was forever
engaged in perusing the study of Vedic texts has been now made to follow the course of exile to the
forest. We will carry the Vedas in our hearts as our excellent treasure and our wives too will
remain at home, protected by their character. We shall not revoke our decision. Our mind is fully
determined to go along with you (to the forest). If you do not pay attention to piety, what being
will remain devoted to the path of virtue? Oh, prince of resolute conduct! We entreat you by our
heads having gray hair like the white color of the swans, that are soiled with dust as a result of
their falling on the ground (in the course of our prostration to you) (pray) turn back. Sacrifices
have been commenced by many of those Brahmanas that have come here. Their completion, depends on
your return. Beings both animate and inanimate, are indeed devoted to you. Show affection to those
devotees, who entreat you to return. The trees held by their roots, unable to accompany you, seen
to be weeping, hump-backed by the force of wind. Birds too, which sit motionless and are unable to
go out in search of food and which remain fixed at one spot on trees, are supplicating you to
return, compassionate as you are to all created beings."</p>
<p class="tat">While those brahmanas were crying thus with a view to persuading Rama to return, the
river Tamasa appeared there, as though retarding the progress of Rama. Thereafter Sumantra the
charioteer too released the horses, tired as they were, from the chariot and quickly making them
roll, allowed them to graze not very far from the (bank of) Tamasa once they had drunk water and
had their body washed in the river.</p>
