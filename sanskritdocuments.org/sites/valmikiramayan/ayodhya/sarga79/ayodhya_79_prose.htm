<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 79</h3>
<p class="tat">The king-makers request Bharata to take over Ayodhya kingdom. Bharata refuses to do
so and promises to bring back Rama to Ayodhya and make him only as the king. Bharata further orders
for construction of a path-way to reach the forest.</p>

<p class="tat">Thereafter, early in the morning on the fourteenth day, the king-makers coming
together, spoke to Bharata the following words: "Dasaratha, who was our highly venerable master,
went to heaven after sending his elder son Rama and the exceedingly strong Lakshmana to forest. O,
the highly illustrious prince! From now on, do you be our king. Fortunately, this kingdom has not
yet missed the mark, even without a king. O, prince Bharata! Taking all the things needed for
coronation, your own people (the counsellers and the ministers) as well as the citizens are
awaiting for you. Take over the stable kingdom, which came in succession from your ancestors,
coronate yourself and rule us."</p>
<p class="tat">The firmly resolute Bharata performed circumambulation clockwise around all the
things kept ready for consecration and replied to all those people as follows: "It is indeed
appropriate to bestow kingship always to the eldest of our clan. You, being the conversant people,
ought not to tell in this manner to me. Our eldest brother, Rama will become the king. I then will
reside in the forest for fourteen years. Let a great and exceptionally powerful army consisting of
all the four limbs be kept ready. I shall bring Rama our elder brother from the forest. Keeping in
front, all the assembled requisites needed for consecration, I shall proceed to the forest for the
sake of bringing back Rama. Consecrating him, the tiger among men there itself, I shall surely
bring Rama solemnized in front, as bringing home the sacred fire from a sacrificial rite, after
performing it outside the city. I shall not make her, my so-called mother, fulfil her desire. I
will reside in the impassable forest. Rama will become the king. "Let a path-way be prepared by
those skilled in that profession, by leveling the uneven surfaces. Let guards who can easily move
in the inaccessible forests accompany us in the path."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing Prince Bharata, talking in consideration of Rama's cause, all the people
replied in the following illustrious and excellent words: "Let the gracious goddess of prosperity
abide with you, who are speaking thus, desirous of giving kingdom to Rama the eldest son of the
king."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing those excellent words spoken by the prince close to their ears, tears born
of joy fell from the face and eyes of those venerable men. Hearing these words, the people there
along with council and the ministers felt cheerful, being relieved of their anxiety and spoke the
following words : "As per your command, devoted men and a group of artisans have been instructed to
make the path-way."</p>
