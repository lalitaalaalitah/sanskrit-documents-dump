<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 88</h3>

<p class="txt">Bharata and his minister approach the foot of Angudi tree, where Rama has slept on a 
grass-bed on the ground. Bharata feels bad that on his account, Rama and Seetha were to sleep on such 
a grass-bed. He thinks that the city of Ayodhya is plunged in desolation, because of the death of Dasaratha 
and the exile of Rama to the forest. Bharata further takes an owe that like Rama, he will also henceforth 
sleep on grass with his locks matted, wearing robes of bark and living only on roots and fruits. He 
says that if Rama refuses his appeal to occupy the throne of Ayodhya, he also will stay back in the 
forest along with Rama.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - </p>

<p class="tat">Having heard all that perfectly, Bharata approached the foot of Ingudi Tree along with 
his ministers and gazed on that grass-bed on which Rama had slept. Thereafter, he said to all his mothers 
as follows: &quot;It is here that the magnanimous hero laid himself for that night, his limbs pressing the 
earth. Born of the great and sagacious Dasaratha in an illustrious family, Rama verily does not deserve 
to sleep on this bare earth! How could Rama the tiger among men, who used to sleep on a couch horded 
with rich cushions covered with superior hairy skins of antelopes, sleep on a bare floor? Having ever 
dwelt in palaces, the upper apartments resembling the chariots of the gods and in turrets, furnished 
with excellent carpets decked with heaps of flowers, perfumed with sandal and aloes, like unto a bright 
and towering cloud, re-echoing to the cries of parrots, surpassing the finest of palaces, which were 
cool and fragrant with perfumes, as unto Mount Meru with its golden walls, where in that palace he was 
awakened at the fitting time by songs and music from various instruments, tinkling of ornaments and 
the excellent sounds of clay tom-toms, glorified by many panegyrists, bards and ministrels through appropriate 
ballads and songs of praise.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;This ( such a prince becoming like this) is unbelievable in the world and does not appear 
true to me. My mind is indeed bewildered. I wish that it were a dream. Surely even a deity is not a 
little more powerful than Time (the will of god), since that Rama, the son of Dasaratha has to sleep 
on the bare ground! Even Seetha the daughter of the king of videha, lovely to look upon and the cherished 
daughter-in-law of Dasaratha has to sleep on the floor!&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;This is the bed of my elder brother. Here are indeed the blessed marks of his changing 
sides, in the form of all the blades of Kusa grass, trampled by his limbs on the hard ground. I think 
the blessed Seetha has slept on this bed along with her jewels for, some particles of gold appear to 
be stuck up, here and there. It is very clear that the upper garment of Seetha got entangled with these 
blades here at that time. That is why, these silk-threads appear stuck to them. I think the bed of her 
husband is sweet to a woman and thought Seetha is young and unfortunate, yet however delicate she be, 
she would experience no suffering. Alas! I am a cruel man because on my account, Rama, like an orphan, 
along with his wife slept on such a bed. How can Rama, born in the race of monarchs, highly honoured 
by the entire world, beloved of all the people, having a dark complexion as that of a blue-lotus, having 
red eyes, lovely to look at who is entitled for comfort and who is not worthy of suffering, sleep on 
the ground, abandoning excellent kingdom and comfort?&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Lakshmana, having auspicious marks on his body and an exceedingly lucky man, who accompanied 
his elder brother Rama in times of adversity in indeed a fortunate man. Seetha, who went together with 
her husband to the forest, is indeed an accomplished woman. All of us, deprived of the highly virtuous 
Rama, are an unsettled lot. Dasaratha went to heaven. Rama is dwelling in the forest. this kingdom appears 
to me as a boat without helmsman. Even if staying in the forest, Rama protects this earth with the power 
of his arms. Hence, nobody can think even in his mind, to invade this kingdom. Without guards to watch 
over its ramparts, with its unrestrained horses and elephants, with its city-gates laid open, without 
any defenders, denuded of its happy army, plunged in desolation in difficulties and exposed, that royal 
capital of Ayodhya will be shunned like poisoned food even by the enemies. From today onwards, I shall 
sleep on the earth or on the grass, with my locks matted, wearing robes of bark and by all means living 
on fruits and roots.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;For the rest of his exile, on behalf of Rama, I shall dwell cheerfully in the forest, 
thereby discharging that promise so that the vows of Rama shall not have been made in vain. Shatrughna 
will bear company with me, residing in the forest on behalf of Rama. My elder brother, Rama along with 
Lakshmana will protect Ayodhya. Rama will be enthroned in ayodhya, by Brahmanas the Twice-born! May 
the gods grant that my desire be made a reality. Should Rama not accept the respectful appeals made 
in many a way by me, I shall follow the foot steps of Rama for any length of time he roams about in 
the forest thereafter. He ought not to refuse this grace to me.&quot;</p>
