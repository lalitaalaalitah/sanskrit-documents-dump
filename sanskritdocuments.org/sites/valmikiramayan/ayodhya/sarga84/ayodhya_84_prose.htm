<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Ayodhya Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 84</h3>


<p class="txt">Guha the king of Nishada tribe asks his relative to guard the river bank and get
ready for a battle, if necessary, with Bharata. Then, Guha approaches Bharata with a welcome-drink
of honey, meat and fish. He asks Bharata with his army to accept his hospitality.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - -  </p>
<p class="tat">Just on seeing an army encamped and positioned along the River Ganga, Guha the king
of Nishadas hastily spoke to his relatives as follows: "On this side, a huge army is seen like an
ocean. I am not able to comprehend the extent of this army even by my discerning mind. Here is seen
on that chariot, a towering banner bearing Kovidara tree and hence Bharata himself with an evil
intent seems to have come."</p>
<p class="comment">Kovidara tree: pomegranate tree.</p>
<p class="tat">"Will Bharata the son of Kaikeyi bind us with chains or slay us? Or is he coming to
kill Rama, the son of Dasaratha, who was exiled from the kingdom by his father, desirous as Bharata
is to get the prosperous Ayodhya kingdom, a luxury and that which is inaccessible to another? Rama
the son of Dasaratha is my Lord and my companion too. Hence you, covered with armor, be stationed
on this bank of Ganga River, desiring to advance the interest of Rama. Let all our ferrymen
guarding the river, along with the troops, eating meat roots and fruits ( in their boats), stay
positioned along the River Ganga. Let five hundred boats, each manner by a hundred youthful
ferrymen, be stationed and made ready" -thus announced Guha. If Bharata is favourably disposed now
towards Rama, then only his army may (be allowed to) cross the River Ganga in safety."</p>
<p class="tat">After uttering thus, Guha the king of Nishadas took fish, meat and honey as an
offering and approached Bharata. Seeing him approach, Sumantra the charioteer, a majestic man who
knows the rules of discipline, humbly told Bharata as follows: "This Lord who is surrounded by a
thousand of his own people, is fully acquainted with the forest of Dandaka and also an old friend
of your elder brother. O, Bharata! For that reason, let Guha the king of Nishadas see you. He knows
surely where those two Rama and Lakshmana - are stationed."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing the auspicious words of Sumantra, Bharata answered, "Introduce Guha to me
without delay." Having obtained permission, Guha along with his own people, joyfully and humbly
approached Bharata and spoke as follows: "This place is like a pleasure-grove near your house. We
are your subjects and are reporting to you as such. Stay in this servant's house. Here are the
roots and fruits gathered by my tribe as well as fresh and dried meat of great quality and of
various kinds, and all a produce of the forest. I hope the army, after eating well, can halt for
the night here. Furnished with all you could desire, you can continue your journey tomorrow along
with your troops."</p>
