<p class="comment">The author of commentary known by the name of  Ramayana Siromani'construes the word   Dasha' in the sense that it should be split
up as   Dasha cha, Dasha cha, Dasha cha(meaning three times then = thirty Kroshes) Since 1 krosh= 2 miles, 30 kroshes= 60 miles and thus approximate
to the figure worked out by the said commentator. According to the latest measurements, the distance is calculated as eighty miles. Making allowance
for the difference in the standard of measurement abtaining in those days the figure arrived at by the learned commentator appears to be fairly
concet.</p>
