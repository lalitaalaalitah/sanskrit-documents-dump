	<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose Sarga 89</h3>

	<p class="txt">Vibhishana enters the battle-field and destroys many demons. He speaks encouraging
	words to the chiefs of monkeys urging them to carry on the combat. The monkeys start a furious attack
	on the demons. Even Hanuma begins to destroy thousands of demons. Indrajit rushes towards Lakshmana
	and starts fighting with him. Lakshmana kills Indrajit&#39;s charioteer. Four excellent monkey-chiefs
	kill Indrajit&#39;s horses and destroys his chariot.</p>
<p class="verloc"> - - - - </p>
	<p class="tat">Seeing Lakshmana and Indrajit, fighting with commitment to gain victory one over
	the other, like elephants in rut, that strong and valiant Vibhishana, wielding his excellent bow,
	stood there at the battle-front, with an intent to behold their combat.</p>

	<p class="tat">Standing there thus, Vibhishana stretched his great bow and released excellent sharp
	pointed arrow son those demons. Falling in exact spot, those arrows, hitting like fire, tore the
	demons into pieces, as thunderbolts would cleave large mountains. Even the foremost of demons, the
	attendants of Vibhishana too, rent asunder those valiant demons in battle, with pikes, swords and
	sharp-edged spears.</p>

	<p class="tat">Surrounded by those demons, Vibhishana shone like an elephant in the midst of proud
	young tuskers. Vibhishana, who knew the timing, spoke to the monkeys, who cherished to destroy the
	demons, the following opportune words duly inspiring them. &quot;O chiefs of monkeys! Here stands before
	you, one who is the last support of Ravana. He is all that is left in his force. Why do you stand
	idle? At the end of this war, if this sinful demon is killed, the remaining army is as good as killed,
	except Ravana.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Prahasta was killed. The valiant Nikumbha, the mighty Kumbhakarna, Kumbha, the demon
	called Dhumraksha, Jambumali, Mahamali, the highly swift Ashaniprabha, Suptaghna, Yajnakopa, a demon
	named Vajradamshtra, Samhadri, Vikata the destroyer of enemies, Tapana, Manda, Praghaasa, Praghasa,
	PrajaN^gha, Janga, Agniketu who was difficult to be conquered, Agniketu, the valiant Rashmiketu,
	vidyujjihva, Dvijihva, Suryashatru, Akampana, Suparshva, Chakramali, Kampana and the mighty Devantaka
	were also killed.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Having killed these many mighty and foremost of demons and having swun the ocean,
	let the tiny puddle be crossed. &quot;O monkeys! Only this much of army remains yet to be conquered here.
	All the demons, who were proud of their strength, having come to the battle-field here, were killed
	by you. Driving away tenderness, for the sake of Rama, I will kill my own brother&#39;s son though being
	his uncle (who is as good as a father), it is not appropriate for me to compose his death. My eyes
	are getting clouded with tear, even when I think of killing him. This long-armed Lakshmana alone
	will finish him. O Monkeys! All of you, together, kill his servents standing beside him.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Thus impelled by that illustrious Vibhishana, those monkey-chiefs were rejoiced and
	lashed their tails (in a happy mood). Then, those monkeys-chiefs, roaring time and again, emitted
	various kinds of sounds resembling the sounds of peacocks at the time of seeing the clouds. Even
	Jambavan and those monkeys, accompanied by all those, who belong to their identical troops, began
	to strike the demons with stones, nails and teeth.</p>

	<p class="tat">Those mighty demons, having various kinds of weapons, abandoning their fear, surrounded
	that Jambavan, who was playing havoc on them. They struck Jambavan, who was killing the army of
	demons in battle, with sharp axes, spears with sharp edges, sticks and javelins.</p>

	<p class="tat">That tumultuous and terrific battle accompanied by a great noise, occurred between
	the monkeys and the demons as between enraged celestials and demons. That haughty Hanuma too who
	felt enraged, causing Lakshmana to descend from his back, and tearing up Sala tree from a mountain,
	approached the demons and himself began to destroy those demons in their thousands.</p>

	<p class="tat">That mighty Indrajit, the destroyer valiant enemies, after giving a tumultuous fight
	to his uncle, yet again rushed towards Lakshmana. The two valiant celebrities, Lakshmana and Indrajit,
	the two intense fighters in battle, then began to strike each other, showering a multitude of arrows
	on their enemies.</p>

	<p class="tat">The mighty and energetic Lakshmana and Indrajit covered each other off exceedingly
	by a network of arrows, in the same way as the sun and the moon are veiled by clouds at the end
	of summer. Due to lightness of their hands, even as they fight there, neither the holding of the
	bow, nor the taking off the arrows, nor fitting them on their bow-string, nor adjusting their fists,
	nor drawing the bow-string nor attaining the target was visible.</p>

	<p class="tat">The sky, having been covered by a multitude of arrows, on all sides, discharged with
	force by them both, was shrouded in darkness. Meeting Indrajit, Lakshmana fought with him. Meeting
	Lakshmana, Indrajit too took the offensive. As they clashed with each other, there was terrible
	confusion (as to who would win ultimately). By the sharp arrows released almost continuously with
	the sky was covered with darkness.</p>

	<p class="tat">By the fall of a multitude of their sharp arrows in hundreds, the quarters and sub-quarters
	were filled with arrows. All the space was covered with darkness, showing up great fear. While the
	sun was setting down, encircling darkness all over, large streams of blood in plenty poured out.</p>

	<p class="tat">Cruel and carnivorous animals diffused awful sounds with their roaring noise. Wind
	did not blow at that time nor the wind blazed up. Those great sages proclaimed, &quot;May it be well
	for the (three) worlds!&quot; The frightened Gandharvas the celestial musicians along with Charanas,
	the wandering singers arrived there to see tha battle-field.</p>

	<p class="tat">By discharging four arrows, Lakshmana then struck four black gold-adorned horses
	of Indrajit. Thereupon, with alacrity of his hand, that illustrious Lakshmana, fully stretching
	and releasing another sharp thunderbolt-like arrow, named Bhalla, which was yellowish in colour,
	with charming plumes, having a good splendour similar to Indra&#39;s thunderbolt and echoing a clapping
	sound, severed the head of Indrajit&#39;s charioteer from his trunk, even as he was circling around.</p>

	<p class="tat">When the charioteer was killed, the greatly splendoured Indrajit did the charioteering
	by himself and also took hold of his bow. For them, who saw his capability in that battle, it looked
	wonderful. When he was driving his horses, Lakshmana struck him with sharp arrows. When he was attending
	to his bow, he released arrows on horses.</p>

	<p class="tat">Lakshmana, who was swift in his acts, tormented Indrajit who was ranging the battle-field
	fearlessly, with a multitude of arrows on such opportune occasions. Seeing his charioteer killed
	in battle, Indrajit became dejected and los this enthusiasm in undertaking the combat.</p>

	<p class="tat">Seeing Indrajit with a despondent face, the monkey-chiefs were very much dejected
	and then acclaimed Lakshmana. Then, four monkey-leaders named Pramathi, Rabhasa, Sharabha and Gandhamadana,
	getting impatient, acted hastily. Those four monkeys, having a great might and terrible prowess,
	quickly bounced and descended on his excellent horses. Blood started flowing from the mouths of
	those horses pressed under the weight of those monkeys, as huge as mountains.</p>

	<p class="tat">Those crushed horses, with their limbs broken as also moving to and fro, fell down
	dead on the ground. After killing his horses, those monkeys also crushed that great chariot and
	jumping up again with speed, they stood by the side of Lakshmana. That Indrajit, whose charioteer
	was killed and horses destroyed, leaped down from his chariot and attacked Lakshmana with streams
	of arrows.</p>

	<p class="tat">Then, that Lakshmana like Indra the lord of celestials, restrained those arrows with
	many a number of his arrows. That Indrajit was coming on foot, as his excellent horses had been
	killed and began to release exquisite sharp arrows in battle.</p>
