<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 4</h3>
<p class="tat">After hearing the report of Hanuma, Rama fixes an auspicious hour for
the departure of his forces to Lanka and perceives good omens. The Army reaches the shores of the
sea.</p>
<p class="verloc">- - - -</p>
<p class="tat">Rama, a very bright man and a true warrior, having duly
heard the words of Hanuman from the beginning, thereafter spoke as follows:</p>
<p class="tat"> "I shall destroy quickly Lanka, the city of that terrible
ogre (Ravana), of which you just informed.  I am really telling this. Be pleased to approve our
march at this moment, a suitable moment for success. The sun reached the mid-day. Let that ogre go
(to his abode) after kidnapping Seetha. Where will he go alive? Hearing of my march to Lanka,
Seetha will get back her hope in life, like a sick man having drunk poison touches ambrosia at the
end of his life. This northern planet of Phalguni will be in conjunction with the Hasta star
tomorrow. Hence, let us depart today itself with all the troops accompanying us, Oh, Sugreeva! By
seeing the omens which are becoming visible, I deduce that I shall bring back Seetha the daughter
of Janaka, by killing Ravana. My eye which is twitching on the upper lid is proclaiming as it were,
my desire of victory coming nearer."</p>
<p class="tat"> Then Rama the virtuous man well-versed in moral law, who
was well-adored by Sugreeva the king of monkeys and Lakshmana, again spoke as follows:- "Let
general Nila accompanied by a strength of hundred thousand warriors go before the army, to explore
the way. Oh Nila the chief of Army! Steer the army speedily by the path, abound with fruits and
roots, cool woods  fresh water and honey. The evil-minded demons may spoil the roots, fruits and
water in the path-way. You always try to be on your guard. Let the monkeys jump into low grounds,
into places made inaccessible by forest-groves and into thickets and notice whether any rival
forces are stationed there. Let whatever little of feeble forces remaining, stay back in
Kishkindha, as our operation will indeed be dreadful. It has to be discharged daringly. Let the
best of monkeys with great strength in hundreds and thousands lead the formidable front of the
army, which is akin to an oceanic stream. Let Gaja, equal to a mountain, Gavaya a very strong
warrior and Gavaksha march in front, as a majestic bull marches in front of a cow-herd. Let the
monkey called Rishabha, Lord of the simians and the best of the primates march forward, duly
guarding the right side of the army of the simians. Let Gandhamadana, with a strength unconquerable
like an elephant in rut, proceed duly guarding the left side of the army of monkeys. I myself,
mounted on the shoulders of Hanuman, like Indra on Airavata, will march in the centre of my troops,
duly cheering the multitude of army. Let this Lakshmana, resembling the lord of Death, march on the
shoulders of Angada like Kubera the lord of riches and the sovereign of beings, marches on an
elephant called Sarvabhauma. Let the highly strong, Jambavan with Sushena and the monkey called
Vegadarshi, all three, guard the middle part of the army."</p>
<p class="tat"> Hearing the words of Rama, Sugreeva with great
valour, the commander of forces and the lion among monkeys gave orders to
the monkeys accordingly. Then, all those troops of monkeys with great speed together rose up and
quickly bounced from caves and mountain-tops. Thereafter Rama the virtuous man, treated
respectfully by Sugreeva and Lakshmana, moved towards southern direction, along with the army.</p>
<p class="tat">At that time, Rama went surrounded by monkeys, looking
like elephants, numbering in hundreds, hundreds of thousands and millions. That extensive army of
monkeys followed Rama who was marching in the lead. All those monkeys maintained by Sugreeva were
rejoicing with delight.</p>
<p class="tat">The monkeys, jumping overwhelmingly with roaring sound and
jest fully playing musical instruments (like trumpets) marched towards southern direction. They
marched on, eating good-smelling honeys and fruits and carrying large branches bearing clusters of
blossoms in multitude. Wild monkeys would lift up and throw one another all of a sudden. Some
others were hanging down and flying upwards. Some other monkeys were throwing down others.</p>
<p class="tat">Monkeys close to Rama were thus shouting, "To us, Ravana
is worthy of killing and also the entire demons."</p>
<p class="tat">Rishabha, Nila, and the courageous Kumuda along with many
monkeys were clearing up the path ahead. Sugreeva the king of monkeys, Rama and Lakshmana the
destroyers of enemies were moving in the centre along with many robust and terrible monkeys. The
heroic monkey Satabali who was accompanied by hundreds of millions of monkeys, standing alone
firmly, guarded the whole army of monkeys.</p>
<p class="tat">Kesari with a retinue of a hundred crore, Panasa, Gaja and
Arka along with many monkeys were protecting one flank of that army. Keeping Sugreeva in front,
Sushena and Jambavanta surrounded by many bears, protected the hinder part of that army.</p>
<p class="tat">Nila their chief of the army, the brave and the best among
monkeys, the self controlled and the foremost among movable beings, was protecting that army in
every direction.</p>
<p class="tat">Valimukha, Prajangha, Jambha and Rabhasa the monkey were
moving on all sides, urging the monkeys forward. Those foremost among the monkeys, proud of their
strength, thus marching with the army, saw the Sahya mountain the best of mountains joined with
many small mountains, lakes fully abounding in flowers and eminent ponds. That large army of
monkeys, terrific like an ocean-flood cognizing the command of Rama which is frightfully enraging,
having terror-stricken, abandoning the vicinity of towns and even villages, marched like a highly
dreadful ocean with a great hoaring sound. All those prominent and
valiant monkeys were overwhelmingly jumping ahead, like fine horses being whipped, at the side of
that Rama.</p>
<p class="tat">Rama and Lakshmana the best among men being carried on
shoulders by Hanuman and Angada the two monkeys, were effulgent like the
moon and the sun having come together in contact with two large planets (Jupiter and Venus). 
Thereafter, Rama the virtuous man, treated respectfully by Sugreeva and Lakshmana, moved towards
southern direction, along with the army.</p>
<p class="tat"> Lakshmana, with a fully meaningful presence of mind,
sitting on Angada, spoke the following auspicious words which were fully meaningful, to Rama. 
"Killing Ravana fast and obtaining Seetha who was taken away, you will proceed to Ayodhya which is
abundantly rich, having accomplished your purpose. I am seeing all grand good omens in the sky and
the earth self-evident of your fulfillment, Oh Rama! The wind which is favorable, gentle beneficial
and comfortable to the army is blowing alongside. These beasts and birds are uttering sonorous and
sweet sounds. All the quarters are looking bright. Even the sun is clear. The planet of Venus with
its bright light, born from the sage Bhrigu (a mind-born son of Brahma the creator) is hanging
behind you. Dhruva, the very bright pole-star (which is recognized by the contiguity of the stars
presided over by the seven Brahmana sages) is becoming clear. All the pure great sages having
bright light are shining  around Dhruva star. The royal sage Trishanku, our paternal grand father,
born in the high-souled Ikshvaku dynasty, is purely shining (as a star) in front, along with his
family-priest. Visakha stars are shining clearly without any evil influence. This supreme
constellation is of our Ikshvakus, the high-souled."</p>
<p class="tat"> "The Mula constellation of the titans is badly aspected,
in that it is touched by a comet raised with a tail of light and tormented by it. All this has come
for the destruction of the titans, for, the star seized by death is oppressed by a planet in its
last hour. The waters are crystal-clear, with good taste. The woodlands are laden with fruit. The
fragrant air is not blowing much. Trees are bearing seasonal flowers. The armies of monkeys formed
into different squadrons are looking highly splendid like the armies of celestials in the battle in
which the demon Taraka was killed, Oh venerable one! Be pleased to see these good omens in this
manner."</p>
<p class="tat">The delighted Lakshmana spoke thus, cheering up his
brother. Then, the army of monkeys consisting of excellent bears and monkeys with their very nails
and teeth as weapons marched ahead, covering the entire earth. The awful dust rose by nails and
claws of monkeys obscured the splendor of the sun and also covered the earth comprising of
mountains forests and the atmosphere. The colossal monkey-army advanced, encompassing the southern
region like a mass of cloud enveloping the sky.</p>
<p class="tat">While the army was crossing the entire river-currents
uninterruptedly, the currents flowed inversely for a distance of many yojanas.</p>
<p class="tat">The mighty army entered thoroughly into lakes containing
clear water, mountains full of trees, plain-landed territories and forests laden with fruits from
the middle, from the four sides, from across and from under. The gigantic army marched, thoroughly
covering the land. All of them with a wind-like speed went on, manifesting a joy in their
faces.</p>
<p class="tat">For the sake of Rama, the monkeys with fully</span> elevated pace vied with each other in high spirits, vigour and prowess. Out of
pride born of prime youth, some made various gestures on the way. Some wild monkeys there walked
very speedily. In that manner, some others hovered highly. Some made noises, sounding "kila!
kila!"</p>
<p class="tat">Some monkeys lashed their tails. Some even stamped their
feet. Some others, stretching their arms, broke off rocks and trees. Some monkeys ascended
mountain-peaks and uttered huge noises. Some others made lion's roars. Some monkeys were crushing
many webs of creepers by the jerks of their thighs. The valiant monkeys also played with rocks and
trees, by stretching their limbs.</p>
<p class="tat">In that place, the land was covered splendidly by hundreds
of thousands, by thousands and crores of monkeys, who were looking very dreadful. That extensive
monkey-army was marching day and night. All the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva were exceedingly pleased
and cheerful. All were marching quickly, rejoicing for war. Those monkeys who were desirous of
Seetha's release did not halt even for a moment anywhere. Then, those monkeys reached and climbed
up a mountain called Sahya with a full canopy of trees and filled with many kinds of beasts. Rama
too went along, seeing the wonderful woods, streams and cascades of Sahya and Malaya mountains. The
monkeys enjoyed the fruits of Champaka, Tilaka, mango, Praseka, Sinduvaara Timisa and Karaveera
trees.                                                                    </p>
<p class="tat">The monkeys enjoyed Ashoka, Karanja, Plaksa, Nyagrodha,
Jambu, myrobalan and Naga trees. Various kinds of forest-trees standing on enchanting plateaus,
being shaken by gust of winds, poured out flowers on those monkeys. A soft-touching breeze,
refreshing as a sandal, blew while the bees hummed in the nectar-scented woods. That royal Sahya
Mountain was highly adorned with red-coloured</span> metal. The dust blown from
that metal by the velocity of wind, coming forth from all sides, obscured the huge monkey-army.</p>
<p class="tat">  On the lovely mountain slopes, in blossom on all sides,
Ketaki and Sindhuvara trees, the charming Vasanti, Madhavi creepers with flowers full of scent,
clumps of jasmine, Chiribila, Madhuka, Vanjula and Vakula, Ranjaka and Tilaka, Nyavriksha all in
flower, Mango, Patalika, Kovidara in flower, Muchulinda, Arjuna, Simsapa and Kutaja, Hintala,
Timisa, Churna and Nipa, blue Ashoka, Sarala, Ankola and Padmaka all these trees were crawled in
excitement by the monkeys who were delighted.</p>
<p class="tat">There were delightful wells with stairs and ponds in that
mountain, sought after by chakravaka birds, frequented by karandava birds, crowded with water-fowls
and cranes, visited by boars and deer, haunted on all sides by bears, hyenas, lions and many
dreadful tigers. There were beautiful reservoirs of water with blossoming blue lotuses, water
lilies, white water lilies, black water lilies and various other kinds of aquatic flowers.</p>
<p class="tat">Various kinds of birds sang in those mountain-peaks.
Monkeys bathed in water, drank those waters and played. They ascended the mountain and got drenched
in water, by sprinkling water by one over the other among them. Monkeys in mad rut plucked
sweet-smelling fruits, roots and flowers there. Those monkeys, in reddish brown colour like honey,
drinking honey from honey-combs weighing about a maund each, went on cheerfully. Those foremost
among the monkeys marched, duly breaking off trees, pulling along creepers and throwing away
excellent mountains.</p>
<p class="tat">Some other monkeys, well-pleased with honey they got from
trees, yelled loudly. Some others reached trees to get honey. Some others were drinking honey
excessively. The earth filled with those excellent monkeys, was like land filled with ripened
fields of paddy.</p>
<p class="tat">Then, the lotus-eyed and the mighty-armed Rama reached
Mahendra Mountain and ascended its top, adorned with trees. Then, Rama the son of Dasartha mounted
the peak and saw an ocean ruffled with water and scattered well with turtles and fishes.</p>
<p class="tat">They crossed Sahya Mountain and Malaya Mountain and
systematically approached the ocean having terrific sound. Rama the foremost of those who entrance
the mind, together with Sugreeva and Lakshmana quickly descended the mountain and went to the
excellent woodland adjoining the sea.</p>
<p class="tat"> "Oh, Sugreeva! We have reached the abode of Varuna. We
should consider now the matter (of how to cross the ocean) with which we were formerly
preoccupied."</p>
<p class="tat"> "This ocean, the lord of Rivers, is shore-less beyond.
This sea is impossible to be crossed without a proper strategy. For this reason, let the military
be assembled here only. Here, let us discuss the plan how this military of monkeys will reach the
other shore."</p>
<p class="tat">Rama, the mighty armed, emaciated due to taking away of
Seetha, then reached the sea and ordered thus for the halt of the army there. "Let all the army be
stationed at the sea-shore, Sugreeva! Here, the time has come for us to think about the subject of
crossing the ocean. Let not anyone slip away in any direction, leaving his respective unit of army.
Let valiant monkeys make a move and it should be known whether there is a hidden danger for
us."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing Rama's words, Sugreeva along with Lakshmana made
the army to halt at the sea-shore, stretched with trees. That army, stationed at the vicinity of
the ocean, shined like a second ocean splendid with yellowish white honey-colored water.</p>
<p class="tat">There, those foremost of monkeys reached the woodlands at
the shore and settled down, desiring to reach the other shore of the vast sea. While all the
monkeys were halting there, the noise created out of their movement was dominantly heard,
concealing the roar of the sea. That army of the monkeys ruled by Sugreeva, stationed as three
divisions (viz. 1. bears 2. long tailed monkeys and 3. monkeys) looked fully dedicated to the cause
of Rama. That army of monkeys reached the great ocean and was delighted to behold the mighty ocean
being diffused by the velocity of wind.</p>
<p class="tat">Seeing the sea, the abode of Varuna, which was boundless
and having the opposite shore far off, inhabited by a number of demons, the monkey-troops sat down
there.</p>
<p class="tat">Rendered appalling by the ferocity of fierce alligators
and crocodiles, that ocean with its foaming waves at the end of the day and at the beginning of the
night, appeared to laugh and dance.</p>
<p class="tat">The ocean surged, when the moon rose. The image of moon
was reflected limitlessly in it. The sea was full of huge alligators swift as fierce winds along
with whales and great fish. That sea, the abode of Varuna was filled with serpents bestowed with
flaming hoods, plunged with mighty aquatic creatures, abounding in various types of mountains, too
difficult to cross, with an inaccessible path, suffocatingly fathomless and an abode of demons.
Increasing waves of the sea in which sharks and bodies of serpents swarmed, rose and fell whipped
into motion by the breeze. Emitting whirled sparkles, shining with large water-snakes, a fearful
abode of enemies of gods forever, and the sea reaches up to the uneven Patala (subterranean
region). The ocean looked like the sky. The sky looked like the ocean. The ocean and the sky looked
alike without any distinction.</p>
<p class="tat">The water blended with sky and the sky blended with water.
Filled with stars above and the pearls below, both the sky and the sea looked with the same
splendor. There was no distinction between the two, of the sea filled with a row of waves and of
the sky with a row of falling clouds. The waves of the ocean together banging one another with a
terrific resonance, sounded like a kettle-drum in the sky.</p>
<p class="tat">Those high-souled monkeys saw the sea lashed with winds,
resonating with abundance of precious stones and water, rising high as if enraged in a grip of
hurricane, filled with a number of aquatic creatures and tossed by them in the air by seemingly
murmuring waves. The standing monkeys were struck with amazement to see the ocean seemed moving,
full of resonance produced by a multitude of dashing waves rolling to and fro.</p>
