<h3> VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of
<br>
Chapter [Sarga] 92<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">Ravana feels distressed in hearing the news of his son's death. He gets enraged and after deeply pondering over, decides to kill
Seetha, who was the root of all this trouble. Ravana with a sword in his hand, sallies forth towards Ashoka garden to make a short work of Seetha.
Seetha observes Ravana rushing towards her and laments that after killing Rama and Lakshmana, he is coming to her place to kill her. Beholding the
lamentation of Seetha, Suparshva, a good and upright minister of Ravana advises Ravana to desist from that dastardly act and to divert his anger
towards Rama in battle. Ravana accepts the advice of his minister and returns to his assembly-hall.</p>
