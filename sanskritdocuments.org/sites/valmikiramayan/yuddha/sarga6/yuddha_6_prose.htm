<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 6</h3>

<p class="tat">Ravana recalls the over-powering of Lanka and discovering of Seetha by Hanuman. He calls 
a meeting of his ministers and invites suggestions from them in view of the latest situation of a probable 
attack of Rama and his army on the City of Lanka.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - </p>

<p class="tat">Having seen the fearful and the terrible act in Lanka done by Hanuma, like Devendra the 
powerful King of celestials, Ravana with his face descended a little with shame, spoke to the demons 
as follows: &quot;By him, who was only a monkey, the irresistible City of Lanka was entered into and was 
over-powered. Seetha the daughter of Janaka was also discovered by him. The thousand-pillared building 
used as a sanctuary was assaulted by Hanuma. Our most excellent demons were killed. The entire City 
of Lanka was made turbid. May prosperity befall on you! What shall I do? What appropriate thing is to 
be done next? Please speak that which is well-answering and that, if attempted becomes well-done.</p>

<p class="tat">O, people of great strength! Wise-men say that victory is dependent on good forethought. 
Verily for that reason, I desire a deliberation about Rama. There are three types of men in the world, 
namely the foremost the middle most and the lowest. I am telling their inherent merits and defects. 
The wise call him as the foremost among men, who carries through the beginning of any undertaking after 
consulting those who are wedded with welfare of others, or with ministers who are
efficient in conferring decisions or with friends having common interests 
or additionally with relatives or who try to get a favour from 
Providence too. The wise men call that man as mediocre, who deliberates about an activity solitarily, 
applies his mind on law and justice all by himself and performs works singly. He who does not determine 
the merits and demerits of an act clearly, having recourse to Providence and neglects his duty by simply 
telling &#39;I shall do it&#39;, he is the lowest among men. In which manner these men are categorized always 
as good, bad or mediocre, so also the resolution in thought is
classified as good bad or mediocre.</p>

<p class="tat">The wise say that resolution of thought is excellent, in which the thinkers, on a view 
perceived by scriptures, obtain consensus and are satisfied with it. Only after deliberating several 
kinds of opinions, that decision of a matter obtained finally by a consensus of the counselors, is called 
mediocre. That resolution is said to be worst in which several arguments are made, employing one or 
the other divergent opinions and in which there is no advantage even after a consensus. For that reason, 
you, having excellent intellect, arrive at a well-thought out rightful action. To me, this is earnestly 
to be done. Rama surrounded by thousands of courageous monkeys, is coming to the City of Lanka, for 
the purpose of besieging us. Rama, by his be-fitting strength, can certainly cross the ocean easily, 
with his brother along with his army and his companions. He may even get the ocean dried up. He may 
do any other thing by his valour. The aforesaid act of enmity 
with monkeys having commenced in this way, advise me everything that is good for the city and my army.&quot;</p>

<h4>Thus completes 6th Chapter of Yuddha Kanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki, the work 
of a sage and the oldest epic.</p>
