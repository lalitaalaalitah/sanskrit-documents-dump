<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 51</h3>

<p class="txt">Hearing the rejoicing cries of the monkeys, Ravana asks some demons to discover the
cause of that rejoicing. The demons mount the rampart and discover that Rama and Lakshmana have
been relieved of the shackle of arrows. They come to Ravana and inform that the two brothers Rama
and Lakshmana are alive and appear like two strong elephants in the battle-field. Ravana then calls
Dhumraksha, a demons and asks him to go with an army and kill Rama, Lakshmana and the monkeys
Dhumraksha along with his army enters the western gate of Lanka where the army-chief Hanuman is
stationed. While Dhumraksha advances in the battle-field, he observes several bad omens and feels
disturbed.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - -  </p>
<p class="tat">That tumultuous sound, set up by the monkeys who were full of martial ardour,
arrested the attention of Ravana and his demons. Hearing that mighty clamour, sounding smooth and
deep, Ravana spoke to his ministers who surrounded him.</p>
<p class="tat">"A great uproar, resembling the rumbling of clouds, has arisen from that horde of
rejoiced monkeys. Undoubtedly their joy is great, their mighty roars are agitating the briny ocean
itself. Those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana were tied by sharp arrows. This sound of a great
magnitude being heard by me, is begetting an apprehension in me."</p>
<p class="tat">Having spoken thus to his ministers, Ravana the Lord of Demons said to his demons
who stood round him there (as follows): "You immediately discover from what cause this general
rejoicing among all these monkeys coming for the their present grievous situation!"</p>
<p class="tat">Thus commanded by Ravana, they mounted the rampart very briskly and saw the army
lead by the high-souled Sugreeva and also the highly fortunate Rama and Lakshmana who were relieved
of the terrific shackle of arrow a and risen up together. All the demons felt desponded on seeing
it. With their hearts trembling with fear and faces turning pale, all those terrific demons
descended from the rampart and approached Ravana.</p>
<p class="tat">With downcast faces, those demons skilled in speech, faithfully informed Ravana of
those unpleasant tidings, saying: "The two brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, whom Indrajit had bound
with his benumbing shafts and whose arms he had pinioned, are free from the arrows which paralyzed
them and now appear on the field of battle, as two strong elephants who have snapped their
fetters."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing their words, the might Ravana was filled with anxiety and fury. His face
became pale (and he spoke as follows): "If my adversaries, having thus been bound by Indrajit are
freed, despite their injuries in battle by his formidable arrows which were infallible those rare
boons, resembling serpents, bright as the sun, I perceive my entire army in jeopardy. Those very
arrows, bright as fire, which in battle have taken the life of my enemies, have now been rendered
void indeed!"</p>
<p class="tat">Having spoken thus in furious tones, hissing like a snake, he addressed a demon
called Dhumraksha who was seated amidst the demons and said. "You, with a terrific prowess, go
quickly with a considerable force of demons and slay Rama, Lakshmana and his monkeys." </p>
<p class="tat">Thus commanded by Ravana, the intelligent Dhumraksha, going past from there, quickly
departed front her royal palace. Having crossed that gate, he spoke to the General of the Forces as
follows: "Mobilize the army. Hasten quickly. What need is there for the delay?"</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing the words of Dhumraksha, the general of forces, having the army which
followed him, kept the army ready quickly, as per Ravana's command. Those strong demons of terrific
form, making sounds with bells hung on their bodies, joyously surrounded Dhumraksha. Furnished with
every kind of weapon, brandishing spears, hammers, maces, harpoons, sticks, iron cudgels, bars,
clubs, javelins, missiles, nooses and axes, those terrible demons sallied forth with the noise of
thunder. Clad in mail, mounted on chariots that were magnificently dressed with flags and decorated
with bands of pure gold, harnessed to mules of many heads or steeds of exceeding fleetness or
elephants in furious rut, some other excellent demons went forth like veritable tigers.</p>
<p class="tat">Dhumraksha, with a mule-like clatter, set out in a celestial chariot to which mules
adorned with gold and heads of deer and lions were hitched. That Dhumraksha of mighty prowess,
surrounded by demons, set forth amidst mocking laughter, through the western gate where the
army-chief Hanuman was stationed. As he mounted and advanced in an excellent chariot harnessed to
mules, whose voices he emulated, birds of ill-omen in the sky obstructed that advancing demon of
very terrible and fearful appearance.</p>
<p class="tat">A highly terrible vulture alighted on the top of his chariot, while those devourer
of corpses clustered on the point of his standard. Streaming with blood, a huge decapitated trunk
fell to earth, emitting inarticulate noise in Dhumraksha's vicinity and the sky rained down blood.
The earth trembled. The wind with noise resembling a thunder blew adversely. Every quarter,
obscured by abundant darkness, did not dazzle. Seeing those terrible omens that appeared in all
their horror to the demons, Dhumraksha became perturbed. Terror seized all the demons who were
advancing in front of Dhumraksha. </p>
<p class="tat">Then, Dhumraksha, the highly terrible and strong demon, surrounded by a multitude of
demons, eager to enter into combat, set out and beheld that army of a multitude of monkeys,
resembling a flood, protected by the arms of Rama.</p>
