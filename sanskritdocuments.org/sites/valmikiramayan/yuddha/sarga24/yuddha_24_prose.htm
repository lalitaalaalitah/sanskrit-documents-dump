<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 24</h3>

<p class="txt">Seeing Lanka and describing it, Rama instructs Lakshmana to draw up his army in battle 
array. Rama orders for release of Shuka who was captured by the army earlier. Shuka approaches Ravana 
and describes the strength of Rama&#39;s side of the army. Ravana boasts himself of his own army&#39;s strength.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - - </p>

<p class="tat">That army of valiant monkeys along with the king Sugreeva looked charming like a full 
moon night in autumn presided over by the moon and illuminated by bright stars. The earth pressed under 
foot by that multitude of army which was energetic like a sea, was trembled with fear by the rapid movement 
of that army. Then the monkeys heard a great tumult arising in Lanka and noisy sounds of kettledrums 
and tabours, which caused their hair to stand on end. The leaders of monkeys were rejoiced by that sound. 
But by not tolerating that sound, they emitted shouts, which surpassed that uproar. Those demons too 
heard the roaring of the wildly delighted monkeys, which roar sounded like thundering of clouds in the 
sky.</p>

<p class="tat">Seeing Lanka dressed with multi colored flags and buntings, Rama bethought himself of 
Seetha and his heart was filled with grief. &quot;Seetha whose eyes resemble those of a young deer, was detained 
by Ravana there, as Rohini star is overshadowed by the red bodied planet (mars).&quot; Seeing Lakshmana after 
a warm and deep sigh, the heroic Rama spoke the following words, which were beneficial for him at that 
time :- &quot;O, Lakshmana! Look at this Lanka, which appears as though constructed on a hilltop by Visvakarma 
with his imagination and so elevated scraping the sky. The city of Lanka was constructed densely with 
many seven storied buildings and appears like a sky the abode of Vishnu (the all pervaded), covered 
with white clouds. Lanka is made beautiful by the garden vying with chaitraratha (the garden of Kubera 
the god of riches) with songs of birds of various species, with fruit bearing flowers and charms in 
bloom. See how a gentle breeze sways the branches where the cuckoos abound where bees swarm and where 
the birds are excited with joy.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Rama the son of Dasaratha spoke as aforesaid to Lakshmana. The army there was divided 
into battalions according to the procedure found in scriptures. He issued the following commands: --&quot;Taking 
these troops of monkeys from the army, let the valiant and the invincible Angada take up his position 
with Nila at the center of the formation. Let Rishabha along with the multitude of monkeys take up his 
position, having recourse to the right side of the army. Let Gandhamadana, the strong and unconquerable, 
resembling an elephant in rut, take his position superintending the left side of the monkey troops. 
I shall stand alert in the forefront of the army along with Lakshmana. Let Jambavan, Sushena and Vegadarshi 
the monkey - those three exceeding wise leaders of bears and monkeys- protest the belly portion of the 
army. Let Sugreeva the king of monkeys protect the rear guard of the army, resembling Varuna (the god 
of water) who remains enveloped with splendor protects the western quarter of the earth.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">That army with innumerable divisions, being skillfully distributed led by the foremost 
of monkeys, resembled heavens with their mass of clouds. With a desire to crush the demons in battle, 
the monkeys, seizing peaks of mountains and gigantic trees, reached Lanka. All the heroic monkeys held 
the following resolve in their minds, &quot;It is with peak of mountains or with our bare fists even, we 
shall shatter this Lanka into pieces.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Then, Rama with great splendor spoke the following words to Sugreeva, &quot;Our forces are 
properly marshaled. Let this Shuka be released.&quot; Hearing the words of Rama, Sugreeva the lord of monkeys 
released Shuka the messenger, as per the order of Rama. Shuka who was harassed by the monkeys and released 
then as per the words of Rama, was trembling with great fear and reached Ravana.</p>

<p class="tat">Ravana, even while laughing, enquired Shuka with the following words: &quot;why were your 
wings tied up? You appear with your wings plucked up. Have you not fallen as a victim to their various 
fickle minds?&quot; Asked as aforesaid by the king Ravana, Shuka agitated as he was with fear, gave him the 
following excellent reply: &quot;On the northern shore of the ocean, I conveyed your message in a smooth 
tone, conciliating and without any ambiguity exactly as per your instructions. Just on seeing me, the 
enraged monkeys jumped on me and seized me. They soon started beating and plucking me with their fists. 
O, Lord of demons! Those monkeys are not capable of being spoken to, or possible of being questioned 
in this matter. Monkeys, by their very nature, are angry and ferocious. That Rama the killer of Viraadha, 
Kabandha and Khara came along with Sugreeva to the place of Seetha. Having constructed a bridge across 
the sea and crossed the salty ocean and expelling the demons, here stands Rama wielding a bow. Thousands 
of divisions of hordes of bears and monkeys resembling mountains and clouds, cover the earth. There 
is no more possibility of an alliance between these two armies - the army of demons and the army of 
monkeys- than between a God and a demon. Very soon they will come to our rampart. Immediately, do any 
one of these two acts- either to restore Seetha or to offer a combat to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing the words of Shuka, Ravana with his eyes becoming blood red in anger, as if he 
would consume him with his glance, said as follows: &quot;Even if I were frightened by all the worlds or 
even if I were to face a battle with celestials or Gandharvas (celestial singers) or demons, I would 
not give back Seetha. When will my arrows soon fall upon Rama, as large black bees excited with joy 
fall upon a tree in bloom at spring time? When shall I consume his body flowing with blood, by the blazing 
arrows released from my bow, as flaming torches destroy an elephant? Endowed with a huge army I shall 
eclipse the aforesaid army of Rama, as the brilliance of all stars is obscured at the rising of the 
sun. My rashness is like that of the sea and my strength is like that of the wind. Rama is not aware 
of it. That is why, he is desirous of meeting me in a combat. Rama has not seen my arrows resembling 
venomous serpents lying in my quiver. That is why, he desires to fight with me. Rama was not formerly 
aware of my prowess in battle. I shall cause to resound Vina (a musical instrument) in the form of my 
bow, which is played on with the heads of my arrows, the bow string producing a tumultuous sound, the 
huge cries of the wounded its terrible accompaniment, the darts sounding its innumerable notes, when 
I enter a vast stage in the form of my enemy ranks in that battle. Neither by the thousand eyed Indra 
the god of celestials nor by Varuna the God of waters in person in a combat, nor by Yama the god of 
death with the fire of his arrows, nor by Kubera the lord of riches in person, can I be able to be attacked 
in a great battle.&quot;</p>
