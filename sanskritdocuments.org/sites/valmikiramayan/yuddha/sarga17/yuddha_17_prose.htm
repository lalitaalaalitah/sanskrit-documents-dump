<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 17</h3>

<p class="txt">Vibhishana together with four of his companions reach Rama's place. Halting in the
sky itself, Vibhishana asks Rama to give a refuge to him. Sugreeva tells Rama that he cannot trust
Vibhishana the demon. Then Rama asks for opinion of the leaders in his group. Angada, sharabha,
Jambavan and Mainda expressed their apprehensions to accept Vibhishana. But Hanuman says that
Vibhishana need not be doubted because he thinks that Vibhishana understands the merits in Rama and
demerits in Ravana. Hanuman further adds that Vibhishana is approaching Rama for refuge because
Vibhishana is desirous of obtaining the kingdom of demons. Hanuman requests Rama to take his final
decision on the matter.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - - .</p>
<p class="tat">Having spoken the aforesaid harsh words to Ravana, Vibhishana arrived almost
immediately to the place where Rama was together with Lakshmana. Those leaders of monkeys standing
on the ground saw Vibhishana, resembling the peak of Mount Meru and shining like a thunderbolt in
the sky. His four companions of terrific prowess were also there with him. They were wearing
weapons and armour and were adorned with excellent ornaments. Vibhishana also resembled a mass of
cloud, the equal of the God who wields the thunderbolt. He was holding excellent weapons and was
adorned with wonderful jewels. Sugreeva the valiant of monkeys, who was difficult to be
overpowered, having seen Vibhishana, the fifth one along with four others, became thoughtful along
with monkeys.</p>
<p class="tat">Having thought for a moment, Sugreeva spoke these sterling words to all those
monkeys and to Hanuman in particular: "See this demon possessing all types of weapons, coming along
with four demons. There is no doubt that he is coming to kill us."</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing Sugreeva's words, all those excellent monkeys lifted trees and mountains and
spoke as follows: "Do you swiftly order us to slay these wicked doers, O, king? Let us strike these
fools down so that they drop to the ground!" While the monkeys were speaking thus among one
another, Vibhishana had reached the northern shore and indeed coolly halted there.</p>
<p class="tat">That great and highly intelligent Vibhishana, halting in the sky itself, saw
Sugreeva and those monkeys and spoke to them in a loud voice (as follows): "There is a demon called
Ravana, the king of demons, having a bad conduct. I am his younger brother, known as Vibhishana. It
is Ravana who, having killed a bird Jatayu, took away Sita from Janasthana.That unfortunate lady is
held captive against her will and she is now amidst the female titans who guard her jealously. I
persuaded Ravana again and again by my diverse words and arguments to restore Seetha smoothly to
Rama. That Ravana, impelled by fate, did not receive my sage advice, as a perverted person does not
accept his prescribed medicine. Reviled by him and humiliated as a slave, I, leaving my sons and my
wife, have come to take refuge with Rama. Inform immediately to high soled Rama, the protector of
all the worlds, that I, Vibhishana, have come here."</p>
<p class="tat">The swift-paced Sugreeva, having heard the words of Vibhishana, spoke more hurriedly
to Rama, in front of Lakshmana as follows: "Belonging to the enemy force, here is an adversary
taking us unawares, who unexpectedly has come here to slay us at the first opportunity like an owl
destroying crows!. You ought to be aware of the design, distribution, leading of the army and the
secret service of the monkeys and also of your foes. May good come to you!. These demons can assume
any form at will and can disappear. They are valiant and deceitful. We can not trust them at any
time. He may be a spy of Ravana the king of demons. He will succeed to become a member among us and
create differences. There is no doubt. Otherwise he , intelligent by himself, can get into
possession of a weak point in us. Having first gained our confidence by craft, he may even at any
time attack us. A contingent supplied by friends or an inhabitant of the woods (like our selves),
or furnished by hereditary warriors or paid servants - all these contingents can be accepted but
not that furnished by an enemy. He is indeed a demon by nature and a brother of an enemy who came
directly from an adversary. How can we keep trust in him? The younger brother of the famous Ravana,
called Vibhishana along with four other demons approached you for refuge. Know that Ravana is
sending Vibhishana. I opine that Vibhishana is fit for arrest. Being sent with a crooked intent,
this demon came here to attack when you are going to repose faith in him, (remaining hidden by his
witchcraft). This Vibhishana is indeed the brother of cruel Ravana. Hence, let him along with his
ministers be killed, by imposing severe punishment on them."</p>
<p class="tat">The chief of army Sugreeva, who knew how to speak expressed thus hurriedly to Rama,
who was skilled in oratory and thereafter entered into silence. Hearing those words of Sugreeva,
the exceedingly strong Rama addressed as follows to the monkeys in front of Hanuman staying near
by: "The very reasonable words uttered by Sugreeva about Vibhishana were heard by you too. An
efficient and intelligent person ever desirous of everlasting well being of his friends should
properly advise them well in difficult matters. Hence, tell your opinion one by one"</p>
<p class="tat">Thus asked by Rama, those monkeys free from lassitude, wishing to do good and out of
their politeness, spoke their respective opinions to Rama as follows: "O, Rama! Nothing is unknown
to you in the three worlds. You are consulting us with a friendly heart, as an honor to us. You are
avowed to truth, a valiant man and a righteous man of firm fortitude. You take action only after
proper investigation. You have good memory. You are committed in your heart to your friends. Hence,
your counselors, who are rich in their minds and are moreover efficient, one by one, will tell
their opinion with reason."</p>
<p class="tat">Having spoken thus by the monkeys, Angada the intelligent monkey told Rama to
arrange for examination of Vibhishana before hand. "Vibhishana who came from an enemy is indeed to
be doubted by all means. He is not to be made as a trust worthy person so soon. Deceitful persons
move around, concealing their peculiar nature and attack at weak places. They will create a very
great misfortune. One must take a decision, after ascertaining the pros and cons of it. One should
take up the action, if there is an advantage and reject it, if it is faulty. If there are great
faults in him, let him be rejected undoubtedly. If we recognize many good qualities in him, let him
be accepted."</p>
<p class="tat">Thereafter Sharabha on his part spoke the following meaningful and decisive words:
"O, tiger among men! Let a spy be sent to shadow him. By sending out a spy and causing a suitable
investigation by a keenly intellectual spy, he can then be accepted as per justice."</p>
<p class="tat">Then, the discerning Jambavan on his part, perceiving the matter through his
learning derived from scriptures, advised the following fault-less and qualitative words: "This
Vibhishana came from sinful Ravana who has contracted hostility with you and that too at a wrong
place and time. He is to be suspected by all means."</p>
<p class="tat">Then Mainda, skilled in discriminating good and bad conduct in others observed the
matter carefully and spoke in his perfect oratory in the following highly reasonable words: "O,
king of kings! This Vibhishana is indeed the younger brother of that Ravana. Let him be questioned
slowly by sweet words. Having read actually his mind whether he is dangerous or not, you should act
according to your feelings."</p>
<p class="tat">Then the well educated Hanuman, the excellent among counselors; spoke the following
smooth meaningful, sweet and brief words: "Even Brihaspati, while talking cannot excel you, who are
possessing an exalted intellect. You are powerful and the foremost man among those who are
eloquent. I am talking neither for argument, nor for competition (with other counselors, nor for
superiority, nor out of passion for debate but on account of importance of this matter in hand. I
am perceiving an error in what was advised by your counselors assigned to look into advantages and
disadvantages, accruing from accepting Vibhishana. It is not possible for such a judicious
investigation into his character. Without entrusting any work, it is not possible to understand his
ability. But at the same time, it occurs to me as a mistake to entrust any work so soon to a
stranger. What ever was told by your counselors that it was befitting to send spies to Vibhishana,
that action is not possible due to impracticality of the proposition. It has been said that
Vibhishana came into a wrong place and time. In that matter, I have to express my thought. Listen
to it. This place and time become rightly obtained in his mind , as he has thought that you are
superior to Ravana and also found merits in you and demerits in Ravana. It is indeed appropriate
for him to arrive at this place and time, by seeing the prowess in you and the wickedness in
Ravana. It is worthy of his judgment."</p>
<p class="tat">"O, king! Whatever was told by your counselors that let Vibhishana be questioned by
spies of unknown identity, my considered view is as follows: A wise man being questioned suddenly
would be apprehensive of that questioning. In those circumstances, an easily obtained friend
becomes faithless upon facing a deceitful questioning. Without possessing a high skill of reading
his diversified tones, it is not possible rapidly to comprehend his intention. I am not seeing any
bad intention at all in his talk. His face is also bright. Hence, I do not doubt him. A deceitful
person does not approach so fearlessly and confidently. His expression too is not bad. Hence, there
is no doubt to me on him. It is not possible to hide expression of the face, even if it is
concealed. By force, the internal intent of the persons certainly gets revealed. An action endowed
with proper place and time transacts successfully, if it is performed quickly. Seeing your
perseverance and the improper conduct of Ravana as well as hearing about Vali having been killed
and Sugreeva anointed as king, he deliberately came here, with a desire to obtain the kingdom of
demons. On consideration of this aspect alone, he is worthy of acceptance by us.  It has been told
by me this according to my ability about the sincerity of this demon. After hearing my words, you
are indeed the final judge of the issue. "</p>
