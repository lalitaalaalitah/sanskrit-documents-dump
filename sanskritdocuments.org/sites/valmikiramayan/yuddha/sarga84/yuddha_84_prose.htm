	<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda Sarga<br>
	84 in Prose</h3>

	<p class="tat">Vibhishana comes to Lakshmana and beholds Rama having fallen into a swoon and lying 
	in the lap of Lakshmana. Lakshmana informs Vibhishana that on hearing the words of Hanuma saying 
	that Seetha was killed by Indrajit, Rama fell into a swoon. Telling Rama the secret of conjuring 
	trick practiced by Indrajit in killing an illusory image of Seetha, Vibhishana assures him of Seetha 
	being still alive and urges him to send Lakshmana with an army to the sanctuary of Nikumbhila.</p>

	<p class="verloc">- - - - </p>

	<p class="tat">While Lakshmana, who was so fond of his brother, was consoling Rama, Vibhishana, 
	keeping the troops of simian army in their respective positions, arrived there. That Vibhishana, 
	surrounded by four warriors, wielding many types of weapons, and who were chiefs of troops, looking 
	like heaps of black collyrium and who were appearing like elephants, approached Lakshmana who was 
	totally engrossed in sorrow and saw the monkeys also, whose eyes were filled with tears.</p>

	<p class="tat">Vibhishana also saw the great-souled Rama, the delight of Inkshvaku dynasty fallen 
	into a swoon and resting on the lap of Lakshmana. On seeing the embarrassed Rama, tormented with 
	grief, that Vibhishana, distressed as he was in spirits, with agony inside, asked him, &quot;What is 
	this?&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Fixing his gaze on Vibhishana&#39;s face and looking at Sugreeva and those monkeys, Lakshmana 
	with tears pouring down, spoke the following words, with a splendid meaning: &quot;O gentle Sir! Just 
	on hearing through the words of Hanuma, saying that Seetha was killed by Indrajit, Rama entered 
	into a swoon.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&nbsp;Intercepting the narrating Lakshmana in the middle, Vibhishana spoke the following 
	amply meaningful words to Rama, who was in an unconscious state. &quot;I hold that which you have been 
	told by Hanuma with a sorrowful temper, O ruler of men, to be absurd as the drying up of the sea. 
	O the long armed! I know the design of the evil-minded Ravana towards Seetha. He would never do 
	the killing of Seetha.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot; Eventhough begged by me, the well-wisher, several times to give up Seetha, he did 
	not heed that advice. It is neither possible even to see her by recourse to conciliation nor by 
	bestowing gifts nor by sowing dissention. How is it possible then by a war? By any other strategy, 
	it is impossible.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;That Indrajit for his part retracted, by hoodwinking the monkeys. O the long armed! 
	Know that Seetha (who was seemingly killed by him) as illusory. After reaching a sanctuary by name 
	Nikumbhila, this Indrajit will pour oblations into the sacred fire. On returning after pouring oblations 
	into the sacred fire, Indrajit will prove difficult to be overcome in battle, even by celestials 
	including Indra.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;Certainly, this conjuring trick (in the form of killing an illusory living effigy 
	of Seetha) was exhibited by him, who was employing his magical art, expecting interruption by the 
	prowess of the monkeys there. While the sacrificial performance is not ended, we shall proceed to 
	that place, along with an army. O the foremost of men! Give up this improper grief, which has come 
	upon you. Seeing you tormented with grief, the entire army is sinking into despondency.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;Very exalted as you are in courage, stay you here, confident at heart, and send 
	Lakshmana with us, who are taking an army along with us. This Lakshmana, the eminent prince, can 
	make Indrajit abandon that act of sacrifice, by employing his sharp arrows. Then, he will be susceptible 
	of being killed.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;Lakshmana&#39;s arrows, which are sharp and fiery, with a speed equal to the wings of 
	a bird, can drink his blood like cruel birds. O the long-armed one! Therefore, dispatch Lakshmana 
	having auspicious body-marks even as Indra the lord of celestials employed the thunderbolt to kill 
	Indrajit.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;O the best of men! It is not appropriate to delay the killing of the enemy any further 
	now. Therefore, grant permission to Lakshmana to destroy the enemy, as Indra would hurl his thunderbolt 
	to destroy the enemies of celestials. If that Indrajit, the foremost of demons completes the sacrifice, 
	he would not be visible even to the celestials and the demons in battle. If he come with a desire 
	to fight, after ending that sacrifice, the celestials also will feel a great suspicion on their 
	own lives.&quot; </p>
