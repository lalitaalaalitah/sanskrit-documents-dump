<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 73<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Seeing Ravana, his father looking lamented after hearing the death of Ravana's sons and brothers, Indrajit promises to destroy Rama
and Lakshmana. He sets out, for the battle, accompanied by his army. After reaching the battle-field, Indrajit performed a sacrificial ritual there,
duly making an oblation to the fire. After performing the sacrificial rite, Indrajit goes himself invisible into the sky. Indrajit then showers
multitude of arrows towards the monkeys and the monkeys lose their consciousness. Indrajit tears asunder principal monkey-warriors by his maces and
arrows. Then, he rains a multitude of arrows of Rama and Lakshmana. Rama says to Lakshmana that he along with Lakshmana can act as thought they fell
unconscious, so that Indrajit can return to Lanka, boasting of his laurels of victory. Grievously hurt on the battle field by the missiles of
Indrajit, Rama and Lakshmana along with the whole army of monkeys fell unconscious.</p>
