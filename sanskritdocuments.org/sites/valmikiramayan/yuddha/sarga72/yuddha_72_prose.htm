<h3>Yuddha Kanda in Prose Sarga 72</h3>

<p class="txt"><a name="PageTop"></a>Having been informed that Atikaya, Dhumraksha,
Akampana, Prahasta, Kumbhakarna and other mighty 
demons are killed in battle, Ravana felt anxious. He is surprised as to how Rama and Lakshmana got released 
from the bind of arrows, made by Indrajit, his son earlier. He feels that no demon is capable of defeating 
Rama, Lakshmana, Sugreeva and Vibhishana. He enjoins demons to protect the City of 
Lanka
  and even Ashoka garden, where Seetha has been kept in capture. He asks 
the army not to be indifferent to the movements of the monkey-warriors. After issuing the necessary 
instruction to his army, he enters deep into his palace and remains boarding over the loss of Atikaya, 
his son.</p>
<p class="verloc"> - - - - </p>

<p class="tat">Hearing Atikaya having been killed in the hands of the great-souled 
Lakshmana, Ravana was worried and spoke as follows: Dhumraksha, who was greatly impatient
Akampana who was excellent among all wielders of weapons,
Prahasta and Kumbhakarna were killed by Rama, who was unwearied in battle. 
The mighty and valiant demons longing for battle, who conquer the adversaries, 
who was never defeated in battle by the enemies they along with their enemies were killed.
Many other mighty warriors.”</p>

<p class="tat">“That day, Indrajit, my son, whose strength and prowess are renowned, bound both Rama 
and Lakshmana, the brothers with terrific arrows, on which boons had been conferred.
That terrific bind of arrow cannot be released by any celestial 
or a mighty demon or by Yakshas the supernatural beings or
Gandharvas the celestial musicians or Pannagas 
the serpent-demons. Rama and Lakshmana, the two brothers were released from that tie of arrows either 
by their power or by their sorcery or by their marvel I do not know that.”</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;“All of those valiant demon-warriors set out for battle, at 
my command, were killed by those exceptionally mighty monkeys. I do not find any 
demon, who can destroy the valiant Rama along with Lakshmana, Sugreeva and 
Vibhishana accompanied by their army in battle now. By Rama’s
valour, the demons were destroyed. Alas! How great is Rama’s strength! How 
great is the power of his arrow!”</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;“Some regiments of the army have to protect this City and even
Ashoka garden where Seetha is being guarded, vigilantly on all sides. We 
should know the locations of army-regiments and also the places where persons are exiting and entering 
at all times, again and again.”</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;“O demons! Stay on all sides with your respective armies. The various positioning 
of those monkeys are to be watched. Indifference should not be shown to monkeys in any way at any time, 
either at evening or at midnightor at dawn. You have watch whether the army of adversaries is 
fervently active or advancing or staying where it was.”</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing those words of Ravana, all the mighty demons then precisely carried it out forthwith 
in its totality. Having thus instructed all of them, Ravana 
the king of demons, suffering from prickly sorrow and depression, penetrated deeply into his palace. 
Blazed as he was with a fire of anger, Ravana the mighty lord of demons, then remained
broading about the loss of his son (Atikaya) and also sighing again and 
again. </p>
