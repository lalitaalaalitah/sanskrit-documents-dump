<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 54</h3>


<p class="txt">The powerful demon Vajradamshtra penetrated the army of monkeys, sowing terror among
them. The monkeys then sought refuge with Angada the monkey-leader. A fierce battle ensues between
Vajradamshtra and Angada. Angada assaults Vajradamshtra with a sword and Vajradamshtra's head falls
on the ground.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - -  </p>
<p class="tat">The devastation of his army through Angada's prowess filled the mighty Vajradamstra
with anger. Stretching his terrific bow, like unto Indra's thunder bolt, he assailed the monkey
battalions with a flood of arrows. </p>
<p class="tat">Then, the foremost of the demons mounted on chariots, fought the battle with every
kind of weapon. The monkeys, those valiant bulls among the Plavagas, assembling on all sides,
fought with rocks. Then in that battle there, the demons abundantly hurled thousands of weapons on
the foremost of monkeys. The monkeys of mighty prowess, resembling elephants in rut, showered down
giant trees and huge lumps of rock on the demons.  </p>
<p class="tat">Between those courageous warriors, the demons and the monkeys, who never retreated
in battle, a tremendous struggle ensued. Some monkeys and demons, with their shattered heads, but
bereft of arms and legs, lay on the earth bathed in blood with their bodies wounded by weapons, a
prey to herons vultures and crows or devoured by troops of jackals. </p>
<p class="tat">Monkeys and demons fell on the battle-field; headless trunks leaps up to the terror
of all the fearful, their limbs hacked to pieces in the combat. Thereafter, under the eyes of
Vajradamshtra, all his army of demons were killed and broken up by the monkey-troops.</p>
<p class="tat">Seeing the demons terrified with fear and decimated by the monkeys, that powerful
Vajradamshtra, his eyes red with anger, bow in hand, penetrated the army of monkeys, sowing panic
among them. Thereafter, in his fury, the vigorous Vajradamshtra dispatched those monkeys with
arrows resembling wings of an eagle that flew straight to their target and pierced seven, eight,
nine or five of his opponents simultaneously, thus destroying them. With their limbs crippled by
those arrows and frightened, those monkey battalions sought refuge with Angada, as all creatures
with Brahma the Lord of Creation.</p>
<p class="tat">When he beheld those monkey troops fleeing in disorder, Angada the son Vali
exchanged glances of hatred with Vajradamshtra. Both Vajradamshtra and Angada fought against each
other like a lion and an elephant in rut. They strolled din a tremendous fury. Thereafter, that
Vajradamshtra knocked the mighty Angada at his vital organs with his arrows resembling hundred
thousand flames of fire.</p>
<p class="tat">With all his limbs drenched in blood, the mighty Angada having a terrific prowess
threw a tree on Vajradamshtra. That unperplexed demon, seeing that tree falling on him, cut it into
innumerable pieces which fell in heaps on earth.</p>
<p class="tat">Witnessing the strength of Vajradamshtra, Angada that lion among the monkeys seized
hold of a large rock and emitting a shout, threw it on him. As the rock descended, that vigorous
Vajradamshtra leaping down from his chariot, armed with his mace, stood waiting unperplexed, on the
battle-field.</p>
<p class="tat">Meanwhile, the rock thrown by Angada, falling into the forefront of the battle, then
crushed the chariot with its wheels shafts and horses. Thereafter, Angada the monkey, seizing
another large peak of a mountain adorned with trees, threw it on Vajradamshtra's head.</p>
<p class="tat">Beginning to vomit blood, Vajradamshtra became fainted, clenching his mace
convulsively and breathing heavily for a moment. Regaining his consciousness, Vajradamshtra the
demon was very much enraged and hit Angada full on the chest with his mace.</p>
<p class="tat">Leaving his mace, he performed a pugilistic encounter there. Both the monkey and the
demon thus hit each other in that combat. Exhausted by the blows, spitting blood, those valiant
warriors were like the planets Mars and Mercury.</p>
<p class="tat">Then, Angada the lion among the monkeys, possessing a great splendour, uprooted a
tree full with many flowers and fruits and stood waiting. The demon too seized hold of a shield
covered with the hide of a bull as well as a great beautiful sword decorated richly with a
multitude of golden bells. Thirsting for victory, the monkeys and the demons, making roaring
sounds, roamed about in different ways and collided with each other.</p>
<p class="tat">With their gaping wounds, they shone like a pair of Kimshuka trees in blossom.
Exhausted were both of them while fighting and they sank their knees on the earth. Angada, the
foremost of the monkeys, just after a moment, with his glittering eyes, rose up like a serpent
struck with a stick. The mighty Angada assaulted the giant head of Vajradamshtra with a
well-sharpened and stainless sword.</p>
<p class="tat">Struck by the sword, that charming head of Vajradamshtra, with his limbs drenched in
blood and eyes rolling, fell into two pieces. Seeing Vajradamshtra having been slain, the demons,
deluded with fear, fled panic-stricken towards Lanka, harassed by the monkeys with their down-cast
faces, their heads bowed in shame. The mighty Angada experienced a great joy amidst the monkey
forces, honoured by them for his high courage and he resembled the Lord of a Thousand Eyes
surrounded by the celestials.</p>
