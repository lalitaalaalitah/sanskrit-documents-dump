<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 63</h3>

<p class="txt">Kumbhakarna abuses Ravana for his utter disregard of the earlier advices given by his 
well-wishers like Vibhishana, due to his sheer arrogance and neglect of the scriptures which enumerate 
the king&#39;s duties. Ravana replies to Kumbhakarna that bygone is a bygone and asks him to proceed to 
the battle-front. Then, Kumbhakarna reassures Ravana and promises him that all the adversaries would 
be destroyed by him in the ensuing battle.</p>
<p class="verloc"> - - - - </p>
<p class="tat">Hearing the lamentation of Ravana, Kumbhakarna laughed at a full volume and spoke as 
follows: &quot;The same bad consequence, which was imagined by us earlier while taking the final decision 
after our consultation, is faced by you now, due to your utter disregard of the words spoken by your 
well-wishers. How a doer of wicked deeds indeed falls into damnation, so also a punishment for your 
sinful act has indeed reached your fast.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O emperor! This course of action was not excepted by you at first. 
You did not conceive this consequence, only because of your sheer arrogance of power. He who, abiding 
in power, performs duties to be done earlier at a later stage and duties to be done later, at an early 
stage, does not know what is a right course and what is a wrong course. Action done perversely, regardless 
of space and time, get spoiled like offering oblations without properly making the fire well-prepared.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;He, who acts according to an agreement done with his counsellors, considering three 
types of duties*, by harassing five types of means**, moves along a right course.&quot;</p>

<p class="comment">*1). Conclusion of peace through conciliation. 2) acceptance of allegiance through 
gift. 3) invasion, as a method of coercion. **1) The method of initiating an actions. 2) Personality 
and material to be worked upon. 3) Time and place of action. 4) Provision against mischance and 5) chances 
of success.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;A king who wishes to execute am agreement as per law, understands it through his own 
intellect as well as the counsellors and discovers it through his friends, is on a right course.
O king of demons! A man resorts to virtue or worldly gain or pleasure or all the 
three together or a twin combination of virtue and worldly gain or virtue and pleasure or worldly gain 
and pleasure or worldly gain and pleasure, according to an appointed time*.&quot;</p>

<p class="comment">*The scriptures lay down that virtue should be pursued in the morning, worldly gain 
in the afternoon and sensuous pleasure at night. As an alternative, one is called upon to pursue</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;That sovereign king or crown prince, who, having heard which one is the best out of 
these three but does not keep it in mind, his extensive learning would be in vain. O the foremost of demons! Whosoever deliberates with his counsellors and resorts to an act of with 
his counsellors and resorts to an act of bestowing gifts or conciliation or sowing dissension at appropriate 
occasion or exhibits valour or resorts to them all together or takes recourse to both right action and 
the reverse of it at the right time or pursues virtue or worldly gain or pleasure at the appropriate 
time, that intelligent person never confronts a misfortune in this world.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;A sovereign has to do an act here, looking into his welfare as a consequence along with 
his counsellors who make their subsistence by their intelligence and who understand the true state of 
the things. Men with brutal ideas, who are initiated in discussions, aspire to tell haughty things, 
without fully knowing the precepts of the scriptures.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;The words spoken by those who did not know the scriptures, who do not recollect the 
books dealing with practical life and who covet for abundant wealth are not to be implemented.
Those men who talk with audacity, some inimical things in a friendly way, are 
to be kept out of deliberations, as they certainly spoil the work to be done.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Some counsellors, colluding with some learned adversaries, spoil their king and make 
them do wrong deeds. The king should make-out those ministers who have been transformed 
by the enemy to their side (through bribery and other things) and are enemies though looking like friends, 
through their conduct when a final decision is being taken after deliberation.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Outsiders find out the fickleness of a ruler, who is led away by false appearances and 
quickly performs the acts, as birds discover the hole (made by the arrow of Skanda, the commander-in-chief 
of gods) in the Kruancha mountain. A king who disregards an enemy and does not protect himself, indeed 
faces disappointing occurrences and would be removed from his position. That advice which was tendered 
to you earlier by vibhishana is beneficial to us. Do whatever you wish to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">On hearing those words of Kumbhakarna, Ravana, on his part, twisted his eye-brows in 
anger and spoke the following words: &quot;Why are you advising me like a venerable 
great teacher? What is the use in getting wearied of your speech? Let a work, most befitting of time, 
be performed. Now, it is a waste to tell again of that act which was wrongly done before, either by 
mistake or by an illusion of mind or by taking shelter in strength and prowess.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Let whatever be appropriate at this moment be thought of now. Wise men do not repent 
over the past. Past is indeed but the past. If you have affection indeed for me or if you discover your 
own prowess and if you think it fit in your heart that my work is to be done very much, you nullify 
the hardship, born out of my wicked conduct, by your prowess. He who rescues an afflicted soul, whose 
fortune is ruined, he is the real friend. He who is ready at hand to help those who have deviated from 
the right course, is a kinsman.”</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;Thereupon, hearing those deeply harsh words spoken by Ravana and understanding 
that he is quite enraged, Kumbhakarna spoke slowly and smoothly. Observing that his brother is highly 
perturbed and excited of his senses, Kumbhakarna, while consoling him, gently spoke the following words: 
“O king, the annihilator of adversaries! Listen to my words attentively. O emperor of demons! Enough 
of your giving way to the anguish. Abandoning your anger completely, you ought to be your normal self 
again. O king! Until I live, this idea should not be formed in your mind. I shall destroy him, for whose 
account, you are feeling anguished.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O king! In whatever situation you are placed, I have to give certainly a good advice 
to you. I gave this advice, because of our relation and brotherly affection. See that which is to be 
done and this juncture, out of affection by a brother, viz. the destruction of adversaries in battle, 
will be done by me. See today, O mighty armed king, the fleeing army of monkeys and Rama along with 
his brother being killed by me in the fore-front of the battle-field. O the mighty 
armed! Be happy by seeing that Rama&#39;s head, which I shall bring today from the battle. Let Seetha be 
unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Let all those demons in Lanka, whose relatives have died in battle, witness the death 
of the most beloved Rama today. Today, I shall do the act of wiping off tears of 
demons, who have been afflicted with grief and lamenting because of the destruction of their relatives 
in combat by the adversaries. See today in battle, the mountain-like Sugreeva, 
the king of monkeys, looking like a cloud illuminated by the sun, thrown about, dissipated. O faultless 
Ravana! Why are you agitated now, when you are being consoled by those demons and by me, who are desirous 
of killing Rama?&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O king of demons! Rama will indeed kill you, only after killing me. On that account, 
I do not regret for myself. O Ravana, having unequal prowess and the annihilator 
of enemies! You can command me, even now, as you wish. No other person need be sought, for a dispatch 
to the battle. I can destroy your enemies, who have a great strength. I can engage in combat with all 
those persons, whether he is Indra or Yama or the fire-god to the wind-god or even Varuna. Indra also 
gets frightened of me, having a mountain-sized body wielding a sharpened pike, having pointed tusks 
and even as I roar.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Even otherwise, no one can stand alive in front of me, who is even weaponless and smashing 
the enemies by me strength alone. Without using a javelin or a mace or a sword or sharp arrows, I myself, 
on getting excited, can kill even Indra, with my bare hands.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;If Rama today survives even after facing the rapid blows of my fists, then my flood 
of arrows will drink the blood of Rama. O king! When I exist, why do you suffer from anxiety? Here, 
I am ready to sally forth for the destruction of your enemies. Be free from the terrific fear of Rama. 
In the battle, I will kill Rama, Lakshmana, the mighty Sugreeva and even Hanuma, by whom the city of 
Lanka was burnt off and the demons were killed. I shall devour the monkeys in battle, which is near 
at hand. I wish to contribute a tremendous and extraordinary reputation for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">“O king! If you have a fear for Indra or even for Brahma, I shall remove it then, as 
the sun removes darkness of the night. When I am enraged, even celestials will lay down on the floor. 
I shall extinguish even Yama the god of death. I shall devour the fire-god. I shall 
cause the sun along with the stars to fall asunder on the floor.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;I shall kill Indra. I shall drink away the ocean. I shall crush the mountains into a 
powder. I shall tear up the earth. Let all the living beings, being devoured from all sides see today 
the prowess of Kumbhakarna, who slept for a long time. The entire heaven is not enough for my food. 
I am going to bring you happiness, conferring you a delight by the destroyal of 
Rama. Having killed Rama along with Lakshmana, I shall devour all the chiefs of army of monkeys. O king! 
You make merry today and drink wine. Throw away your agony and perform your usual duties. While I send 
Rama to the world of Yama, the god of death, Seetha will be subservient to your after a log time.&quot;</p>
