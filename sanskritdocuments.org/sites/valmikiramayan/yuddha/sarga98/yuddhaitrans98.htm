Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">When Mahaparshva enters the battle-field and torments the monkeys, Angada comes to their rescue and hits him. Jambavan also enters the
field and breaks the chariot and the horses of Mahaparshva. Then, Angada knocks the bow and the helmet of Mahaparshva, as they fall down. Finally,
Mahaparshva falls dead, succumbing to a forcible blow of Angada's fist.</p>
