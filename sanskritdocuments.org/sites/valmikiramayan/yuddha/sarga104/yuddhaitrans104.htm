<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 104<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana reproached the charioteer for having turned back his chariot away from the battle-field. The charioteer explains to Ravana, the
various reasons as to why he has taken back the chariot. Satisfied with the explanation given by his charioteer, Ravana instructs him to take the
chariot back to the battle-field. Thereupon, the charioteer brings the chariot in an instant before Rama on the battle-field.</p>
