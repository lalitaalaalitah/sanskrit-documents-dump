	<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose<br>
	Sarga 120</h3>

	<p class="txt">When Indra the lord of celestials asks Rama for a boon, Rama requested Indra to bring 
	back to life, all the monkeys who had lost their life in the battle. Indra grants the boon and all 
	the dead monkeys are restored to life. The celestials disperse and the whole 
	army of monkeys enjoy their well-earned rest.</p>

<p class="verloc"> - - - - </p>
	<p class="tat">When Dasaratha returned, the Lord Indra, the destroyer of Paka 
	the demon, was very much pleased and spoke to Rama, who stood there with his joined palms.</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;O Rama, the foremost among men! Your sight of
	us, should not go in vain. Therefore, tell us whatever is desired by 
	you.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Hearing the words of the great souled Indra the lord of celestials, 
	after having been pleased, Rama with the most placid mind spoke the following words with rejoice:
	&quot;O the foremost among the eloquent! O Indra! If you have affection in me, I 
	shall speak out my words. Make my words real. Let all the monkeys, who reached 
	the abode of death, after displaying their energy for my sake restore their life and get up.
	O the bestower of honour! I wish to see all those monkeys, who for my 
	sake, were removed from their sons and wives, be delighted at heart.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;They were all valiant, proving their energies and did not take 
	their death into account. They made their strenuous efforts and died. O Indra! Restore their lives 
	to them.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;Those monkeys - who counted death as nothing and who were fond 
	of doing favour to me - let them get re-united with their near and dear ones by your grace. 
	I seek this boon of you. O bestower of honour! I wish to see the monkeys 
	and bears, free from wounds and pains, with augmented strength and valour.
	Wherever the aforesaid monkeys live, let there be rivers 
	with crystal-clear water, flowers, roots and fruits even in an off-season.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Hearing the words of that great-souled Rama, Indra the lord 
	of celestials endowed as he was with delight, again spoke the following words: 
	&quot;O beloved Rama! This boon, which has been sought by you is hard 
	to grant. No offer has, however, been revised by me in the past. Therefore this will come to be.
	Let all those monkeys and bears along with long-tailed monkeys, who have been 
	killed in battle, by the demons and whose heads and arms have been severed, be alive and active 
	again.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;Without any ill-health and wounds and with boosted strength 
	and valour, the monkeys will rise again, as those fallen asleep would do at the end of their 
	sleep. All of them, full of delight, will get re-united 
	with their friends, relatives, kinsmen and family members. O the wielder of 
	a great bow! The trees will look colourful with flowers and fruits even 
	in the off-season. Rivers too will remain constantly with water.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Thereupon, all those monkey-warriors got up, as if from a sleep, 
	with all their limbs completely healed of wounds. All the monkeys felt surprised, saying to one 
	another &quot;What miracle is this?&quot; Seeing Rama, whose wish has been fully realized, 
	all the foremost of celestials, with a great delight, spoke praisingly to Rama and Lakshmana:</p>

	<p class="tat">&quot;O monarch! Proceed to Ayodhya from here and disband the monkeys. 
	Reassure this illustrious and devoted Seetha. O destroyer 
	of adversaries! See Bharata, your brother, who is practicing austerities through grief caused by 
	separation from you, the great-souled Shatrughna and all your mothers. Get yourself consecrated 
	on the throne. Bring rejoice to the citizens, by going there.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Thus speaking to Rama and Lakshmana, Indra the thousand-eyed 
	god of celestials, having been pleased, returned to heaven with other gods in their aerial cars, 
	shining like the sun. Having respectfully saluted all those celestials, Rama 
	along with Lakshmana his brother, then instructed all the monkeys to take rest in their respective 
	places.</p>

	<p class="tat">Thereupon, that illustrious and mighty army of rejoiced troops, 
	for its part, which as protected by Lakshmana and Rama, and was blazing with splendour on all sides, 
	shone brightly like the might, illumined by the moon.</p>

	<h4>Thus, this is the 120th chapter in Yuddha Kanda of Valmiki Ramayana, the First Epic poem of 
	India.</h4>
