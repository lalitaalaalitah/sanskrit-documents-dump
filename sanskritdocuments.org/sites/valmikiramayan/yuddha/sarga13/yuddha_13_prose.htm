<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 13</h3>

<p class="txt">Advised by Mahaparsva to take charge of Sita by force, Ravana expresses his
inability to do so, because of a curse pronounced against him by Brahma (lord of creation) in the
past. Ravana then boasts of his own prowess.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - - .</p>
<p class="tat">Perceiving Ravana enraged, a very strong demon named Mahaparsva thought for a while
and with joined palms, spoke as follows: "That man indeed is a fool, who after reaching a forest
inhabited by wild beasts and vicious elephants and having duly found honey, does not drink it. Who
is a lord to you, who are a lord of all? Setting your foot upon the heads of your enemies, take
pleasure with Seetha. Act in the mode of a cock, forcibly against her. Enjoy that Sita, by charging
on her again and again and revel with her. What fear will be there to you, after fulfilling your
lust? All that comes or yet to come will be prevented (by us). Kumbhakarna and Indrajit of great
might together with us are capable of keeping off even Devendra (god of celestials), wielding the
weapon of a thunderbolt. Overstepping the methods of giving away gifts or conciliation or even
showing dissention being followed by right men, I like accomplishment of actions through hostile
means.  We shall make all your enemies reaching here to surrender, by the power of our weapons.
There is no doubt about it."</p>
<p class="tat">Appreciating the words spoken thus by Mahaparsva, King Ravana spoke the following
words: "O, Mahaparsva! Know a little secret about me. I shall tell you an incident, which occurred
to me long ago. Once I saw a celestial nymph, Punjikasthala (by name) flashing like a flame,
concealing herself in the sky and proceeding towards the abode of Brahma. She was made unclothed by
me and was enjoyed forcibly. Thereafter, appearing like a crumpled lotus, she went to the abode of
Brahma. I think that the matter was made known to the high soled Brahama and then the enraged
Brahma spoke to me the following words: "From today onwards, if you revel with any other woman
forcibly, your head then undoubtedly will break asunder into a hundred pieces. Fearing the curse
given in this manner by Brahama, I am not violently making Seetha the daughter of Videha, to mount
on my beautiful bed forcibly. My swiftness is like that of an ocean. My movement is like that of a
wind. Rama does not know this and hence he is indeed having an encounter with me. If not otherwise,
who wants to arouse me (for a combat) as one would awaken a lion asleep, sitting at a place in a
mountain cave or arouse into activity an enraged Death? Rama did not see the arrows, looking like
two tongued serpents, coming forth from me. That is why he is marching against me for a battle I
shall blaze up Rama swiftly with my arrows in hundreds resembling thunder bolts discharged from my
bow, like tormenting an elephant with fire brands. Surrounded by great army, I shall take away that
strength of Rama, as a rising sun at dawn takes away radiance of the stars. Even Devendra (lord of
celestials) with thousand eyes or Varuna (king of the Universe) can not conquer me in battle. Once
upon a time, this city of Lanka ruled by Kubera (Lord of riches) was conquered by me with the power
of my arms."</p>
