<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">All the consorts of Ravana lament, recollecting the valour of Ravana and with a stunning surprise of how he has been killed by an
ordinary mortal. They feel sorry that, had Seetha been restored by Ravana to Rama, this major disaster would not have befallen them.</p>
