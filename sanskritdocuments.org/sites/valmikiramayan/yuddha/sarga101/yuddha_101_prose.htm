<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 101</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama laments over the uncertain condition of Lakshmana. He calls Sushena, the monkey-physician. 
Sushena tests Lakshmana and says he is still alive. Sushena then requests Hanuma to go all the way to 
Himalayas and bring the required herbs to treat Lakshmana. Hanuma proceeds to Mount Mahodara and failing 
to identify the herbs there, carries the mountain-peak itself and brings it to Sushena. Lakshmana regains 
consciousness, after getting treated with that herb by Sushena.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - - </p>

<p class="tat">Seeing the valiant Lakshmana bathed in a stream of blood, when struck down in battle 
with a spear by the mighty Ravana and having given a tumultuous fight, to the evil-minded Ravana, Rama 
spoke as follows to Sushena, even while releasing a multitude of arrows (at Ravana):</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;This heroic Lakshmana, falling down on earth yielding to Ravana&#39;s prowess, is wiggling 
like a serpent, causing an increase in grief to me. My energy to fight is failing, even as I see this 
valiant Lakshmana, who is dearer to me than life, bathed in blood, my mind being greatly disturbed. 
Of what use is life or happiness to me, if this illustrious brother of mine, who is endowed with auspicious 
bodily marks and who always speaks highly of war, meets with his death?&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;My valour is feeling shy, as it were. My bow seems to fall down from any hand. My arrows 
are dropping down. My vision has been overcome with tears. My limbs seem to sink down, like those of 
men in sleep. I have a serious tension, growing in me. I even wish to die. My brother has been struck 
down by the evil-minded Ravana, seriously wounded in his vital parts, afflicted with agony and glooming.”</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;Seeing his beloved brother, who was his very life-breath moving outside, Rama was 
afflicted with excessive agony and gave himself up to anxiety and grief. Seeing Lakshmana his brother 
lying wounded in the dust of the battle-field, he got into extreme despondency and lamented (as follows), 
confused in mind, as he was:</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O the valiant Lakshmana! Even victory cannot create a pleasure for me. What pleasure 
can the moon create for a man who has lost his vision? What purpose of mine will be served by fighting 
or eve by life? When this Lakshmana lies killed in the forefront of battle here, I have no use for the 
war. In the same way as the very glorious Lakshmana followed me When I was going to the forest, I too 
will in the same way follow him to the abode of Yama the lord of Death. The demons, who fight treacherously, 
created this condition to Lakshmana, who loved his relatives and who was ardently devoted forever to 
me. Wives may be obtained ever where. Relatives can be had everywhere. However, I do not find a brother, 
born of the same womb, at such a place whatsoever.”</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;The monkeys saw that Rama, thus lamenting with his mind reeling and distressed 
in grief and pitiably sighing his breath repeatedly:</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Of what use is the kingdom for me, without Lakshmana, who was difficult to over power? 
What can I tell to Sumitra, the mother who was so fond of her son? I shall not be able to bear the reproach, 
which will be levelled by Sumitra. What shall I pay to Kausalya the mother or what shall I say to Kaikeya? 
What shall I say to Bharata or to the mighty Shatrughna, when they ask me, how I came back without Lakshmana 
even though I went to the forest along with him? It is better to die at this place 
only, rather than hear the reproaches of one&#39;s own people. What sinful act was done by me in a previous 
birth due to which my righteous brother lies killed before me?”</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Alas! O the powerful brother, the best of men! O the foremost among the valiant men! 
Why are you going to the other world, deserting me? O brother! Why don&#39;t you talk to me, even though 
I am lamenting? Rise and see! Why are you lying down? See me, by opening your own eyes, miserable as 
I am. O the mighty armed! You have been indeed comforting me, whenever stricken with grief, I roamed 
listlessly among mountains and forests or felt low-spirited.” </p>

<p class="tat">Comforting Rama, whose mind was full of grief and who was thus lamenting, Sushena, for 
his part, addressed the following excellent words: &quot;O the excellent among men! 
Give up this notion, which causes despondency in you, this anguish which gives rise to grief and is 
as piercing as arrows, in the forefront of battle. Lakshmana, the augmenter of prosperity, has not got 
into death. His countenance is not changed, nor has it become dark. His face may be seen with a good 
brightness and very much placid. The palms of his hands are resembling the petals of a lotus. His eyes 
too are very bright.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O king! The appearance of the dead does not look like this. O hero, the annihilator 
of enemies! He is all with his life. Do not worry. The repeatedly beating heart with the signs of breath 
of Lakshmana, lying on the earth&#39;s surface, fast asleep, with his limbs relaxed are telling it, O the 
gallant prince!&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Having addressed the words thus to Rama, the highly learned Sushena spoke the following 
words to Hanuma the great monkey, who was standing nearby:</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Proceeding from this place with full speed, O gentle one!, to the mountain called Oushadhi 
(Mahodaya), which was already described to you previously by Jambavan, O brave one! Bring here for restoring 
the great-souled and heroic Lakshmana to consciousness, the precious herb Vishalyakarani (1) by name 
which was sprung up on its southern peak, Savarnakarnani (2), Samjivakarani(3) and 
the precious herb, Samdhanakarani (4).&quot;</p>

<p class="comment">(1) Vishalyakarani: A herb credited with the virtue of expelling an arrow /other 
weapons from the body, healing the wound and relieving pain. (2) Savarnakarani: Another herb supposed 
to possess the property of counteracting the discolouration caused by a wound, burns etc. and restoring 
the original colour of the skin. (3) Samjivakarani: Another herb believed to possess the virtue of bringing 
back an unconscious person to consciousness. (4) Samdhani: A herb credited with the property of joining 
a fractured bone.</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing those words, Hanuma, having sprung to Mount Oushadhi, could not identify those 
precious herbs and became thoughtful. The following thought arose to that Hanuma, 
whose strength was unlimited: &quot;I will go back, taking this mountain-peak itself. 
By conjecture, I understand that the delightful herb must have sprouted in this mountain-peak. Sushena 
indeed has said so. If I go without taking Vishalyakarani, harm may come through passage of time and 
a great perplexity may arise.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Thinking thus, the mighty Hanuma the excellent of monkeys, having gone quickly and approaching 
that excellent mountain, taking that mountain-peak with his arms, shaking it violently for three times 
and uprooting the mountain-peak, which was endowed with many trees in bloom, lifted it up, so mighty 
as he was.</p>

<p class="tat">Taking that mountain-peak, which looked like a dark rainy cloud, that Hanuman jumped 
up into the sky. Arriving with a great speed, Hanuma putting down the mountain-peak and resting for 
a while, spoke the following words to Sushena: &quot;O the excellent of monkeys! I have brought the entire 
mountain-peak, as I could not identify those herbs.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Eulogizing Hanuma, who was thus narrating his trip, Sushena, the excellent of monkeys, 
pulling out the herbs, took hold off them. All those monkey-chiefs and even the gods were surprised 
to see that most difficult feat of Hanuma.</p>

<p class="tat">Then, crushing that herb, Sushena the excellent of monkeys, having a great splendour, 
administered it through Lakshmana&#39;s nose. Duly inhaling it well, that Lakshmana, the annihilator of 
adversaries, having the spear lodged in his body, raised quickly from the earth&#39;s surface rid as he 
was of the spear and his pain.</p>

<p class="tat">Seeing that Lakshmana risen from the ground, the monkeys were overjoyed and applauded 
Lakshmana, saying, &quot;Excellent, excellent!&quot;.</p>

<p class="tat">Rama, the destroyer of enemies, said to Lakshmana, &quot;come, come!&quot; and embraced him firmly 
with affection, with his eyes clouded with tears. </p>

<p class="tat">After embracing Lakshmana, Rama then said to him: &quot;Luckily, O valiant one, I see you 
here, returned from death. There is no purpose of mine, by me own life nor of 
Seetha nor of victory. If you have attained demise, tell me what significance is there for it to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">While the great souled Rama was speaking thus, the exhausted Lakshmana, in a feeble tone, 
spoke the following words: &quot;Having solemnly taken that pledge (of killing Ravana) 
before, O brother true to your promise, you ought not to speak as you have done like a weak and courageless 
man. Those who speak the truth never render their promise futile. Fulfilling their pledge is the indeed 
the attribute of the greatness.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O the faultless one! Getting into homelessness for my sake is not befitting of you. 
Fulfill your promise now, by killing Ravana. An enemy, who falls victim to your arrows, cannot turn 
out alive, as a huge elephant which gets into the path of a roaring lion possessing terrible tusks.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;I, for my part, wish to see the death of this evil-minded fellow instantly, even before 
this sun, having finished his task, does not sink below the horizon. O venerable hero! If you wish to 
kill Ravana in battle, if you wish to fulfill your promise and if you feel affectionate towards Seetha, 
do as I tell you soon and now.&quot;</p>
