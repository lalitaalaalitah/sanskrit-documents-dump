<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 10</h3>
<p class="tat">    Vibhishana, the half-brother of Ravana, lists out bad omens occurring in the
city and in the gynaeceum and advises Ravana to restore Seetha to Rama as atonement to these evil
forces. Ravana turns a deaf ear to Vibhishana's counsel and sends him away. </p>
<p class="verloc">- - - -  </p>
<p class="tat">Vibhishana, who always arrived at a settlement in matters
of virtue, pleasure and wealth and who was terrible in his act, on arrival of the dawn, entered the
palace of Ravana. Ravana's palace was looking like a mass of rocks, elevated like a mountain-peak,
well-divided into spacious apartments and occupied by eminent men. It was inhabited by prime
ministers, who were intelligent and beloved. It was guarded on all sides by demons, who were trust
worthy and efficient. The air was filled with the sighing breaths of elephants in rut, with
tumultuous noise produced by the blowing of conches and made to resound by an ensemble of musical
instruments. The palace was filled with a number of women-folk. It was having principal passages in
which spoken words were heard. It was having turrets made of pure gold and adorned with excellent
decors. The palace was like an abode of Gandharvas (celestial musicians) and of Maruts (storm-gods)
filled with a collection of jewels resembling a house of Nagas (serpent-gods).</p>
<p class="tat">        The valiant Vibhishana with great splendour
entered that mansion of his elder brother, Ravana, like the sun with rays outstretched with
splendour entering a big cloud. Vibhishana with great radiance, heard the auspicious sounds of
felicitous recital of prayers uttered by the knowers of Vedas (scriptural texts), wishing for the
victory of his brother.</p>
<p class="tat">        Vibhishana of great strength saw Brahmins who
know Mantras (sacred texts) and Brahmanas*, respected and offered with pots filled of curd,
clarified butter as well as with flowers and unbroken rice. Being adored by the demons and shining
by his own splendour, offered salutation to Ravana the younger brother of Kubera (the lord of
riches), who occupied the throne.</p>
<p class="tat">    * Brahmanas are those portions of Vedas containing
rules for employment of Mantras at various sacrifices</p>
<p class="tat">    Practicing customary formalities, Vibhishana who
knew the code of conduct, obtained a seat adorned with gold, as endowed to him by a glance of the
king. In the presence of ministers and in privation, Vibhishana spoke to powerful Ravana the words
convinced of reason and which were very much beneficial. He, who could discriminate between good
and evil things in the world, having sought the favour from his eldest (half-) brother by means of
soothing words arranged in an order, spoke in consonance with place, time and purpose.</p>
<p class="tat">    "O, annihilator of enemies! We are seeing
inauspicious omens, since Seetha arrived here. Even if the sacrificial fire is fed with oblations
while uttering a proper set of Mantras (Spiritual texts), the fire is not flaring up well, emitting
sparks, its flames are enveloped in smoke and are coming forth, polluted with soot. Serpents are
seen at the corner of the sacrificial post which is nearest the fire, also in houses keeping
sacrificial fire and in places where sacred studies are made. Ants are seen in things to be offered
as oblations. Cow's milk is getting curdled. Excellent elephants are bereft of rut. Horses are
neighing miserably and are not rejoiced in eating grass. O, king! Donkeys, camels and mules shed
tears, losing their hair and even if treated as per medical procedures are not getting cured. Crows
in flocks are crying cruelly from all sides and are seen in crowds assembled together on
house-tops. Vultures fly to and fro in circles over the city. Jackals are crying inauspiciously at
the approach of both dawn and the dusk. At city-gates are heard loud cries of carnivorous animals
gathered in groups, with thundering noise."</p>
<p class="tat">        "O, brave man! Hence, when the actions of evil
forces are happening in this way, this atonement is appropriate that Seetha be given away to Rama
and I like it.  If I am speaking this because of infatuation or greed, in that case also, you ought
not to find fault with me. These bad omens are being seen indeed by demons and lady-demons of the
city and of the gynaeceum as well as all these people here. All your ministers have abstained to
pass this counsel to you. Whatever is seen or heard, it is to be told certainly by me. Hence, you
ought to do according to a justification of things for the occasion."</p>
<p class="tat">        Vibhishana, the half-brother spoke these
beneficial words to Ravana, the best among demons in the midst of his half-brother's ministers.
Ravana, who had evil inclination, heard those words, which were beneficial, very well-meant, soft,
conformable to reason and suitable for the past future and present times; got enraged and uttered
this reply. "I do not see any fear from whom so ever. Rama cannot obtain Seetha by any means. How
Rama even along with Indra and the celestials can stand before me in battle?"</p>
<p class="tat">    Ravana, who annihilated the army of celestials and
who was very powerful with an impetuous valour, thus spoke and then sent away Vibhishana, who had
spoken honestly.</p>
