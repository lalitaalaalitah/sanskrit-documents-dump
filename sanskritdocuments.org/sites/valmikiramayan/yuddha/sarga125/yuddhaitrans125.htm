<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 125<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama asks Hanuma to proceed to Shringaberapura and communicate to Guha about his welfare and also to know the appropriate path to
Ayodhya. Rama also asks Hanuma to go to Ayodhya and communicate to Bharata about his welfare and also the previous happenings at the forest and at
Lanka, including the abduction of Seetha and her restoration, by killing Ravana in battle. Rama also asks Hanuma to inform Bharata, about their
arrival at the proximity of Ayodhya, along with Sugreeva and Vibhishana. Accordingly, Hanuma approaches Guha and Bharata in Nandigrama and informs
the pleasant news about the welfare of Rama as well as his impending return to Ayodhya. Bharata is overjoyed on hearing the glad tidings from Hanuma
and offers him a number of valuable gifts, for having communicated the agreeable news to him.</p>
