<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 88<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">A fierce battle of archery starts between Indrajit and Lakshmana. Indrajit strikes Lakshmana with seven arrows, Hanuma with ten arrows
and Vibhishana with a hundred arrows/almost at the same time. In retaliation, Lakshmana strikes Indrajit with a multiple of arrows and Indrajit's
armour breaks up into pieces. Indrajit, in response, strikes Lakshmana with a thousand arrows and breaks up Lakshmana's armour. A fierce fight ensues
for a long time. Meanwhile, Vibhishana joins the battle-field, to relieve Lakshmana's fatigue.</p>
