<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Yuddha Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 47</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana summons some female demons including Trijata and instructs them to take Seetha 
in Pushpaka-plane to the battle-front and show Rama and Lakshmana alleged to have been killed by Indrajit. 
Accordingly, the female-demons take Seetha in Pushpaka-plane and show her Rama and Lakshmana lying unconscious 
on a bed of arrows in the battle-field. Imagining Rama and Lakshmana to have been dead, Seetha bursts 
into sobs.</p>

<p class="tat"></p>

<p class="tat">Indrajit, the son of Ravana having returned to Lanka, his purpose accomplished, the leading 
monkeys surrounded Rama in order to watch over him. Hanuman, Angada, Nila, Sushena, Kumuda, Nala, Gaja, 
Gavaksha, Panasa, Sanuprastha and the mighty Jambavan with Sunda, Rambha, Shatabali and Prithu all these 
monkeys, armed with trees, reorganized their ranks, stood alert, surveyed the quarters of the sky up 
and down and on every side and, even if a grass stirred, they exclaimed, &quot;It is a demon!&quot; Ravana, meanwhile, 
full of joy, dismissed his son Indrajit and thereafter summoned the female demons who guarded Seetha.</p>

<p class="tat">Following his orders, the female-demons along with Trijata appeared before him. Then, 
the rejoiced Ravana said to them as follows:</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Tell Seetha that Rama and Lakshmana have been killed by Indrajit. Take her in Pushpaka 
the aeroplane and show her Rama and Lakshmana who were killed in battle. Her husband, the one depending 
on whom rendered her so proud that she refused to be united with me, lies there killed with his brother 
in the battle-front. From now on, free from anxiety, grief and expectation of reunion, Seetha the princess 
of Mithila kingdom, adorned in all her jewels, will submit herself to me. Beholding Rama and Lakshmana 
fallen under the sway of death on the battle-field today, finding no other haven and hoping for nothing 
else, the large-eyed Seetha will voluntarily seek refuge with me!&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing these words of the cruel Ravana, they all replied, &quot;Be it so&quot; and went to where 
the Pushpaka chariot was. Thereafter, the female-demons brought the aerial car, Pushpaka as per the 
instructions of Ravana and carried it nearer to Seetha who was staying in Ashoka-grove.</p>

<p class="tat">The female-demons brought Seetha who was afflicted with grief for her husband and made 
her to ascend Pushpaka-plane. The female-demons along with Trijata made Seetha to ascend Pushpaka-plane 
and proceeded to show her Rama and Lakshmana. Ravana the king of demons, thrilled with rapture, caused 
Lanka to be garlanded with flags and banners and arranged a proclamation to be made in Lanka announcing 
that Rama and Lakshmana had been slain by Indrajit in battle.</p>

<p class="tat">Seetha along with Trijata, transported by that plane, saw all the monkey-troops who had 
been slain. Seetha saw the demons who were delighted at heart and monkeys disturbed with grief, standing 
round Rama and Lakshmana. Then, Seetha beheld those two warriors Rama and Lakshmana lying unconscious 
on the ground on a bed of arrows, their limbs pierced with arrows, riddled with weapons, their armour 
shattered, their bows cast aside at a distance and their entire body transfixed by darts.</p>

<p class="tat">On seeing those two brothers, who were filled with valour, having lotus-eyes, the excellent 
of men, lying stretched on a bed of arrows there in that wretched plight like the two sons of the fire-god 
(Shakha and Vishakha) lying on a bed of reeds, Seetha wailed piteously, stricken as she was with a great 
agony. The dark-eyed Seetha the daughter of Janaka with her faultless limbs, beholding her lord and 
Lakshmana lying in the dust, burst into sobs. Witnessing those brothers, the prominent sons of god, 
Seetha afflicted with tearful sorrow, believing their death, spoke with grief the following words.</p>
