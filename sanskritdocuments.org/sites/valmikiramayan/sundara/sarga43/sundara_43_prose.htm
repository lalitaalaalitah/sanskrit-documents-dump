<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 43</h3>

<p class="txt">

After damaging the pleasure-grove and after killing the Kinkaras dispatched by
Ravana, Hanuma thinks of destroying a sanctuary which is sacred to the guardian-deity of the
demons. Hanuma ascends to the top of the sanctuary and after killing the guards posted there, shows
his strength by clapping on his arms and by uttering the names of Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva in a
roaring voice. Hanuma assumes a gigantic form and uplifting a pillar in that sanctuary, he speedily
whirls it around and burns the sanctuary by producing a fire, created out of its friction with the
other pillars.<br>

<p class="tat">After killing the Kinkaras, that Hanuma thought to himself (as follows): "The grove
was damaged by me. The lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary (sacred to the guardian-deity of the
demons) has not been destroyed. For that reason, I will cause this mansion to crumble down in the
same way." Thus thinking himself, Hanuma the best among monkeys, son of the wind-god having large
jaws, by showing his strength, bounced up and ascended the lofty palatial mansion of the sanctuary,
which was as high as a mountain-top of Meru.</p>
<p class="tat">That Hanuma, an army-chief of monkeys, possessing a very great splendour, ascending
the lofty palatial mansion similar to a mountain shone like a second rising sun. Overpowering the
lofty and inviolable of the sanctuary, Hanuma blazing mansion his splendour, meta morposed into a
towering sized body equal to that of Pariyatra mountain. Enhancing his body to a very big size by
dint of his distinction, Hanuma clapped on his arms strongly, filling the City of Lanka with
sound.</p>
<p class="tat">By the great deafening noise, made by clapping on his arms, the birds and also the
guards protecting the sanctuary unconsciously fell down. "Long live Rama, skilled in archery and
the powerful Lakshmana! Long lie the King Sugreeva, protected by Rama! I am Hanuma, the destroyer
of the army of adversaries and the son of wind-god. I am the servant of Rama, the king of Kosala
kingdom, who is unwearied in action. Even a thousand of Ravanas will not be matching equally with
me, who is capable of striking with thousands of rocks and trees in battle. Here, before the eyes
of all the demons, I will annihilate the City of Lanka and after offering salutation to Seetha, I
will go back duly completing my task." Thus uttering to those guards protecting the sanctuary,
roared terribly, making a noise and creating a terror to the demons.</p>
<p class="tat">Hearing that loud noise, hundreds of guards protecting the sanctuary went, taking
many kinds of weapons, spears, swords and axes. Those Kinkaras with huge bodies surrounded Hanuma,
duly discharging those weapons. They banged Hanuma with various kinds of maces, iron bludgeons
plated with gold and arrows shining like the sun. That troop of demons surrounding Hanuma the best
among monkeys, shone like a greatly extensive whirlpool in the waters of River Ganga.</p>
<p class="tat">Thereupon, the enraged Hanuma assumed a terrific form. Hanuma possessing a gigantic
body and the son of wind-god, uprooting a pillar with a hundred edges and decorated with gold in
that edifice, then speedily whirled it around. Fire was also generated tto friction with
other pillars) The edifice was then consumed by fire. Seeing the edifice burning, that Hanuma
killing those hundred demons, like Indra killing demons with his thunderbolt and gloriously staying
in the sky, spoke (the following) words:</p>
<p class="tat">"Thousands of monkeys like me, possessing gigantic bodies of strength, were sent on
the orders of Sugreeva. We and other monkeys are now roaming the entire earth. Some of the monkeys
are having a strength of ten elephants. Some are having a strength of a hundred elephants. Some are
having a prowess equal to that of a thousand elephants. Some are having the strength of a strong
stream. Some have strength equal to that of wind. Some other army-chiefs of monkeys even cannot be
measured."</p>
<p class="tat">"Surrounded by hundreds, myriads, lakhs and crores of such monkeys having their
teeth and nails as their weapons, Sugreeva, who is capable of destroying you all, will come. You
hold enmity with the high souled Rama. For this, the City of Lanka will not be there. Neither you,
nor even Ravana will survive."</p>
