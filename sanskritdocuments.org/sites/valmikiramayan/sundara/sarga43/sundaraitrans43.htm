<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 43<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">After damaging the pleasure-grove and after killing the Kinkaras dispatched by Ravana, 
Hanuma thinks of destroying a sanctuary which is sacred to the guardian-deity of the demons. Hanuma 
ascends to the top of the sanctuary and after killing the guards posted there, shows his strength by 
clapping on his arms and by uttering the names of Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva in a roaring voice. Hanuma 
assumes a gigantic form and uplifting a pillar in that sanctuary, he speedily whirls it around and burns 
the sanctuary by producing a fire, created out of its friction with the other pillars.</p>
