<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 47</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana sends Aksha, his own son, to fight against Hanuma. Aksha, along with his army 
elephants and horses, approach Hanuma and incites him to battle by discharging three sharp arrows. As 
Aksha discharges his arrows, Hanuma bounces quickly to the sky and smashes Aksha, his chariot and the 
horses with blows. After killing Aksha, Hanuma returns again to the same archy door-way.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - </p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing and sustaining that the five army-generals along with their followers and vehicles 
were disposed off by Hanuma, Ravana looked at Aksha, his son, violent in combat and who was inclined 
to fighting as well as sitting in front of him.</p>

<p class="tat">Goaded by the looks of Ravana, the energetic Aksha, wielding a golden dotted bow, quickly 
sprang up, like a fire switched up by the foremost of brahmins in a sacrificial fire, by offering oblations 
to it. Mounting a great chariot, having splendour of a newly risen sun and overlaid with protective 
armour of highly refined gold, that valiant chief of demons sallied forth towards that mighty monkey. 
Aksha&#39;s chariot was earned through many kinds of his penances. It was shining with protective armour 
of highly refined gold, adorned with a flag on a flag-staff studded with gems and yoked well with eight 
excellent horses, having speed equal to that of a mind.</p>

<p class="tat">That chariot was unassailable by celestials or demons. It moved without hindrance to 
any place. It shone like a sun and could move within the sky. It was well-conceived with a quiver, eight 
swords and tied with bells. It was orderly arranged with spears and lances in their respective places. 
Then, Aksha having a prowess equal to that of celestials, came forth, mounting that chariot decorated 
with golden wreaths, having a brilliance of moon and sun, filled with every right thing and shining 
like rays of sun.</p>

<p class="tat">Aksha, filling the sky earth and its mountains with sounds of horses, elephants and chariots, 
together with his army, approached the efficient Hanuma the great monkey, standing at the archy door-way. 
Approaching that Hanuma, standing there readily to destroy mortals, similar to a fire that is to destroy 
the world, the yellow-eyed Aksha was bewildered, born of a surprise and looked to him with a great esteem.</p>

<p class="tat">That Aksha, the mighty prince, assessing the swiftness of that high-souled Hanuma and 
his prowess with regard to his adversaries as also his own strength, increased his body more and more 
like the sun when the frost is faded away. Understanding Hanuma&#39;s prowess to be unrestrainable and stable 
in battle, that Aksha, exhibiting anger initially, became stable and mentally composed and incited Hanuma 
to battle by discharging three sharp arrows towards him. Recognizing that Hanuma, as a haughty monkey, 
after having gallantly conquered his adversaries and accustomed to fatigue, that Aksha, grasping the 
bow and arrows his hand, saw him with an excited mind. </p>

<p class="tat">Having a golden chain, a pair of armlets and charming ear-rings, Aksha of a swift prowess, 
approached Hanuma. Their unmatched get-together in combat became a baffle to even the celestials and 
demons. Seeing that battle between Hanuma and Aksha, the earth up roared. The sun did not shine brightly. 
The wind ceased to blow. The mountain shook. The sky made a reverberant sound. The ocean too was agitated.
<a name="Verse14"></a>Then, that eminent demon, who correctly knew how to fix his gaze on the target, 
to fit an arrow to the bow and to discharge it, hurled on Hanuma&#39;s head, three arrows which were well-painted, 
having golden shafts and feathers and which resembled venomous serpents. </p>

<p class="tat">Oozing the blood from his wound caused by those arrows descended into his head (by Aksha), 
looking like the newly risen sun, his eyes bathed in blood rolling rapidly, Hanuma shone brightly like 
the sun surrounded by a circle of rays, having the arrows as its rays. <a name="Verse16"></a>Seeing 
in the battle that Aksha the prince, with his marvelous weapons and picturesque bow, that Hanuma the 
excellent one among Sugreeva&#39;s counsellors, was rejoiced and with an inclination to fight, grew in size.</p>

<p class="tat">That Hanuma, endowed with strength and prowess, resembling the sun appearing on a peak 
of Mandara mountain and whose anger was increased, then burnt the prince Aksha along with his army and 
vehicles, by the rays of fire emanating from his eyes. That demon in the form of a cloud, raining down 
arrows, and then wielding a bow in the form of a rain-bow, soon discharged arrows on Hanuma standing 
in the form of a mountain, like a cloud showering rain on a high mountain.</p>

<p class="tat">Seeing that Aksha the prince, possessing an impetuous valour, endowed with enhanced splendour 
strength and vigour with a capacity to move within the sky like a cloud, coming to the battle, Hanuma 
roared with joy. Boastful of his valour in battle because of his childish attitude, Aksha wit an enhanced 
fury and red-blood eyes, approached Hanuma who was incomparable in battle, as an elephant approaching 
a well covered with heaps of straw.</p>

<p class="tat">As Aksha forcefully discharged his arrows, Hanuma roared a sound of thunder and bounced 
quickly to the sky assuming a terrible sight, stretching out his arms and thighs. That strong and valiant 
Aksha, the foremost among the demons, and the best among car warriors, went chasing Hanuma who was flying 
upwards, diffusing arrows like a cloud showering hail-stones on a mountain.</p>

<p class="tat">That valiant Hanuma, whose swiftness was equal to the mind and possessing impetuous valour 
in battle, rushing forth like wind in the space between one arrow and another and thus escaping Aksha&#39;s 
arrows, moved in the path visited by wind (the sky). With a respectful faculty of sight, Hanuma saw 
that Aksha who was wielding his bow and readily inclined to fight, covering the entire sky with excellent 
arrows with various types of tops and became thoughtful.</p>

<p class="tat">Then, the mighty armed Hanuma, who knew how to act under particular circumstances, roaring 
when pierced in the breast with shafts by the high souled heroic, Aksha, reflected on the prowess of 
his adversary in battle. </p>

<p class="tat">&quot;The mighty Aksha, possessing the luster of a rising sun, is performing a great act, 
as a mature youth. My mind is not conceding here to kill him, who is distinguished in all acts of war-fare. 
He possesses a great intellect and is also prominent by his valour. He is well-composed and highly tolerant 
in battle. Due to his eminent deeds and virtues, he is undoubtedly adored by saints, Nagas the serpent-demons 
and Yakshas the semi-divine being. He is standing very much before me and looks me straight in the eyes, 
reassured as he is, by his prowess and enthusiasm. His swift-moving prowess trembles even the minds 
of celestials and demons. If neglected, he would undoubtedly overpower me. His prowess is getting augmented 
in battle. The only option left out for me is to kill him now. It is not proper to neglect a spreading 
fire.&quot; <a name="Verse30"></a>The valiant and the mighty Hanuma, reflecting thus about the swiftness 
of the adversary and determining his own course of action, then acquired a course of action, then acquired 
a momentum and also made up his mind to kill him.</p>

<p class="tat">That Hanuma, the heroic son of wind, killed using the blows of his palm, those eight 
horses possessing a great speed in the path of sky with alertness as also having a capacity to bear 
burden while turning to different directions. Then, the great chariot of Aksha, thus struck by the palm 
and subdued by Hanuma the counsellor of Sugreeva, had its interior broken, its carriage pole loosened 
and its horses dead and fallen from the sky to the ground.</p>

<p class="tat">Leaving the chariot, wielding the bow and sword, that Aksha the chariot-warrior leapt 
to the sky. Having a terrible power of penance and leaving his body like a sage, he then was seen departing 
to heaven because of his Yogic penance. Thereafter, Hanuma with his prowess equal to that of wind, approaching 
Aksha moving in the sky, which is often frequented by Garuda the eagle, the wind and Siddhas the ascetics 
endowed with supernatural powers, slowly grasped his feet firmly.</p>

<p class="tat">That Hanuma, with a prowess equal to that of wind-god, his father, and the excellent 
one among monkeys, spinning round Aksha like grasping a great serpent an eagle for a thousand times 
in the battle, hurled him down to the floor rapidly. With his arms, thighs, hips and neck broken, blood 
dripping, his bones and eyes crushed, his joints displaced and his sinews shattered, that demon was 
killed by Hanuma.</p>

<p class="tat">Hanuma, having crushed him on the ground, created a great fear to Ravana. Aksha, thus 
having been killed, Hanuma was gazed on with excessive astonishment by great sages who move everywhere 
without obstruction and having great vows as also by spirits Yakshas the semi divine beings, Pannagas 
the serpent-demons and by celestials with Indra the lord of celestials. Killing that Aksha, possessing 
a luster equal to that of Jayanta the son of Indra the lord of celestials and having his eyes resembling 
blood, the heroic Hanuma reached the same archy door way again, like Yama the lord of death expecting 
in a moment any mortal getting destroyed by him.</p>
