<p class="txt">Seetha asks Hanuma to remind Rama of how he threw a blade of grass at the crow and destroyed 
its right eye thereby, as a token of remembrance. She also asks to remind Rama of his having once marked 
on her cheek with realgar, when a mark on her forehead was defaced, as a further token of Hanuma having 
met her. Seetha also requests Hanuma to appraise Rama of her wretched plight and finally greets him 
to have a happy journey ahead.</p>

<p class="verloc">- - - </p>

<p class="tat">Hearing the words of that high-souled Hanuma, Seetha who resembled the daughter of god, 
spoke the following words beneficial to herself. &quot;O Hanuma! Seeing you speaking pleasant words, I am 
as overjoyed, as a field with half-sprouted crop of grain is thrilled by receiving a rain. With my limbs 
emaciated with grief, I have a desire to touch that Rama the tiger among men. Show mercy on me and fulfill 
my desire.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O Hanuma the excellent one among the troops of monkeys! Present the story of the blade 
of grass called Ishika hurled with anger and thereby one eye of the crow destroyed by Rama (as a signal 
remembrance). O Rama! You ought surely to recollect that while a mark on my forehead had got effaced 
once, another mark with realgar was indeed painted by you on the side of my cheek. How are you, the 
valiant man equal to Indra the Lord of celestials and Varuna the King of Universe, ignore Seetha who 
was taken away and now staying in the midst of these demons?&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O faultless Rama! This wonderful jewel for the head head has been protected well by 
me. Seeing this in my distress, I have been getting delighted, as though I have seen you. This splendid 
jewel, produced in water, has been sent to you. Absorbed in grief, I shall not be able to survive henceforth. 
With a hope of your coming here at any time, I am enduring these unbearable hardships and also the words 
of horrible female demons; which pierce my heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O Rama the prince, the annihilator of enemies! I shall hold my life only for a month. 
I will not survive without you, after a month. This Ravana, the king of demons, is terrible. In my instance, 
his glance is not pleasant. Hearing that you are causing a delay, I will not survive even for a moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing the words of Seetha, spoken pitiably with tears, Hanuma the son of wind-god, 
with a great splendour, spoke (as follows): &quot;O Seetha the princess! Rama has grown averse to everything 
else, caused by grief towards you. I sear it to you truly. when Rama is overpowered by grief, Lakshmana 
too gets tormented with grief.&quot; &quot;O lady! Somehow or other, you have been discovered by me. This is not 
the time to lament. You will see the end of your sorrow shortly.&quot; &quot;Those two princes, the excellent 
among men, the annihilator of enemies and who are eager to see you, will surely reduce Lanka to ashes. 
&quot;O large-eyed Seetha! Killing the cruel Ravana along with his relatives, Rama and Lakshmana will take 
you to their own city.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O faultless Seetha! Be pleased to give another token of remembrance, which Rama will 
recognise and which creates pleasure to him. Seetha said, &quot; An excellent token of remembrance was indeed 
given by me. Seeing this jewel for my hair, Rama will trust your words.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Taking that excellent jewel, the illustrious Hanuma, the best among monkeys, offered 
salutation to Seetha by bowing his head and has set off to go. Seeing that Hanuma, the best among monkeys, 
possessed of energy to jump up with great speed and expanding, Seetha spoke (as follows) in her voice 
choked with tears and looking miserable in her face filled with tears.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O Hanuma! Enquire about the welfare of Rama and Lakshmana, the brothers looking like 
lions, of Sugreeva together with his ministers and of all other. Be pleased to make that long-armed 
Rama deliver me from this ocean of sorrow. O valiant monkey! After approaching Rama, appraise him of 
this terrific gush of my grief and also about the threatening attitude of these female-demons. Have 
a happy journey!&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Having been appraised of the matter by Seetha the princess, having accomplished his object, 
having his mind filled with joy and having perceived that only a little remained to be done, Hanuma 
intellectually sought the northern direction.</p>
