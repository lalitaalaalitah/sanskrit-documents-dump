<p class="tat">Thereafter that intellectual Hanuma saw the moon in the sky shining with rays,
obtaining the middle portion of sky. Spreading a great quantity of moon shine, moon looked like a
bull in heat among cows. After that He saw the moon coming up destroying the sins of the world,
causing the great ocean to grow and causing all living beings to shine. What ever splendour shines
over Mount Mandara on earth, on the ocean during evenings, over the lotuses in the waters, the same
splendour shone on the beautiful moon. Like a swan in a silver cage, like a lion in the cave of
Mount Mandara, like a warrior on a proud elephant, in the same way the moon shone in the sky. The
full moon with its horn like spot shone like a sharp horned standing ox with a high hump, like a
great white mountain with tall summits, like an elephant with golden tusks. The Divine moon who
lost the stain of cold water and frost, with lost stain due to eclipse by the great planet sun, one
who has a calm spot which is an abode of brilliant splendour, with a symbol of hare, shone
brilliantly.In whatever way a lion obtaining a level surfaced rock (shines), in whatever way best
elephant obtaining a great battle(shines), in whatever way a king obtaining kingdom(shines), in the
same way the clear moon shone. The Divine evening with lost stain due to rise of shining moon, with
the stain due to meal of flesh eating rakshasas, and in which the bitterness of mind of young women
and their lovers is wiped away, became with a heavenly glow. Musical notes from stringed
instruments which were comforting to ears started. Women with good character were sleeping with
husbands and also rakshasas with extremely strange character started to roam.</p>
<p class="tat">That Hanuma the courageous one, the intellectual one, saw houses with people in
heat, houses filled with people, full chariots, horses, elephants and best furniture and also full
of wealth. He saw rakshasas railing a lot at one another moving their heavy shoulders, throwing
wild and incoherent words a lot, insulting one another being intoxicated.</p>
<p class="tat">Hanuma saw rakshasas who smote breast, those who threw limbs on women, those who
were spreading their strange forms sporting their strong bows. He saw some women applying sandal
paste on their bodies and also some other women sleeping there, in the same way some women with
good appearance were smiling, and some other women were sighing in anger. Hanuma saw the city of
Lanka that shone with great elephants making sound and also with gentlemen well respected, shone
with warriors in a wresting bout, with long sighs, like serpents in a lake hissing. He saaas who were intellectuals, who were good talkers, who had good devotion, important people
to the world, who had various ways, and people who had beautiful names in that city.</p>
<p class="tat">That Hanuma seeing people with good appearance, who had various good virtues, those
who were according to their character, those who were radiant, all those - became happy. Then He
saw those who had horrific appearance, those who were according to their appearance - some of those
too. He saw thereafter there, their women - those who were eligible for distinction, those who were
of great skill with an interested heart in lovers and in drinks and those who were like stars with
good effect.</p>
<p class="tat">Hanuma saw some women who were brilliant with radiance, adorned a lot with
bashfulness, those who were hugged by lovers in the middle of night, those who were hugged with
great pleasure, those who were hugged by flowers like birds. The intellectual Hanuma saw some other
women there comfortably sitting on the laps of their lovers, at the top of their buildings, dear to
their husbands and (some other women) interested in virtuous deeds, and some possessed by the lord
of love. He saw women with golden complexion lacking clothes, women with a complexion of refined
gold suitable for mating and some other women also with the colour of moon and some other women
with beautiful bodies lacking a lover. Thereafter that Vanara warrior saw those with great
happiness, those who obtained lovers who entertained, those who attracted like flowers, those with
great beauty and women in their houses filled with happiness.</p>
<p class="tat">Hanuma saw rows of faces shining like the moon, beautiful rows of eyes with curved
eyebrows and rows of ornaments like beautiful rows of lighting. He did not see Seetha, one with
great beauty born in a royal family following a virtuous path, well brought up, like a creeper in
full blossom, one who was thin, and one who was born from the mind of creator.</p>
<p class="tat">Hanuma did not see that Seetha who stood in the path of ancient righteousness with
Her sight on Sri Rama, who was possessed by the love for Sri Rama, who entered the glorious mind of
husband and always the best among women who were the best. Who was, tortured by separation from Sri
Rama, with unabounding tears in her throat, in earlier times who had invaluable and best jewellery
on her neck, born with beautiful eyebrows, with a sweet voice, like a she- hen who did not dance in
a forest because of Her current sorrow.</p>
<p class="tat">Hanuma did not see Seetha who was like a crescent with a blurred outline, like a
streek of gold coated by dust, like an arrow in an injury, like a series of clouds scattered by
wind. He became a numb minded one for sometime, stricken with grief not seeing for a moment Seetha,
wife of Sri Rama the best among those who talk, and the lord of all humans.</p>

poem of India.</p>
