<h3>Valmiki Ramayana -
Sundara Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 64</h3>

<p class="tat">Coming back to Madhuvana as instructed by Sugreeva, and craving
  forgiveness of Angada, Dadhimukha submits to him that he along with the other
  monkeys are urgently required by Sugreeva. Angada and other monkeys including
  Hanuma spring forward into the air towards Kishkindha. Even before the
  arrival of those monkeys, Sugreeva explains to Rama the valid reasons for
  concluding that Seetha has since been found. Angada, Hanuma and other,
  monkeys approach Sugreeva. Then, Hanuma apprises Rama of the discovery of Seetha.
  Hearing the news, Rama and Lakshmana were thrilled with joy and looked on
  Hanuma with a high esteem.</p><br>
  <p class="verloc">- - - - </p>
<br>
<p class=tat>Hearing the words of Sugreeva, Dadhimukha the
monkey was pleased and offered his salutation with reverence to Rama, Lakshmana</p>

<p class=tat>After offering salutation to Sugreeva and to
the mighty Rama and Lakshmana, that Dadhimukha accompanied by his valiant
monkeys, sprang into the air. 
That Dadhimukha, after
entering Madhuvana, saw all the chiefs of monkeys, who were free from their
intoxication, having passed off the honey and who were inwardly excited.</p>

<p class=tat>With his hands joined together for salutation,
that valiant Dadhimukha approached them and cheerfully spoke the following
gentle words to Angada: 
&quot;O gentle sir! Due to their
ignorance, these guards in anger, obstructed you to enter the grove. No
resentment should be harboured by you about this obstruction. 
O
exceedingly strong Angada! You are the prince and also the master of this
grove. We have done a mistake. 
O faultless Angada! After
going there, I indeed informed your uncle about the arrival of all these
monkeys here.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;Hearing your arrival along with these
leaders of monkeys, your uncle was exceedingly pleased. Even after hearing of
Madhuvana having been attacked, he did not develop any anger. 

Sugreeva, your uncle,
the lord of monkeys and the king was pleased and told me, 'send all the monkeys
here'.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>Hearing these smooth words of Dadhimukha, the
eloquent Angada, the foremost among the monkeys, spoke to those monkeys as
follows: 
&quot;O the foremost of monkeys, the tormentators
of enemies! I assume that Rama might have heard the news (of our arrival).
Hence, it is not proper for us to remain here any longer, now that our work has
been accomplished. 
The monkeys are taking, rest, after
drinking the honey to their heart's content. What is there remaining, except to
go to the place where Sugreeva my uncle is there?&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;I shall do whatever all the leaders of
monkeys together tell me. I am obedient to you, in the matter of what ought to
be done. 
I am not the master to command you, eventhough I
am the crown prince. It is not befitting for me to play the lord over you, who
have accomplished the task.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>Hearing the indeclinable words spoken thus by
Angada, the monkeys with their pleased minds, spoke to him (as follows):</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;O prince, the foremost of monkeys! Who
would speak like this, while he is the lord? Every one indeed thinks one's supremacy
with an excited arrogance and says 'I, I'. 
It is so worthy
of you alone that you have spoken such words. None else can utter like this.
Your humility itself is telling of your future suitableness for prosperity. <a
name=Verse18></a>All of us, who reached here, are waiting for the right moment
to go to that place where Sugreeva, the imperishable king of the heroic
monkeys, is. 
O the excellent of monkeys! Without your
command, it is not possible for the monkeys anywhere, even a step forward. We are
speaking this truth to you.&#8221; 
While they were thus
speaking; Angada replied, &quot;Let us go.&quot; The mighty monkeys then sprang
into the air.</p>

<p class=tat>All those leaders of monkey-troops, like
stones shot from a catapult, making the space space-less, followed Angada, who
was springing forward. 
Those monkeys with speed, sounding
forth a loud noise, sprang into the sky, like clouds driven by the wind. <a
name=Verse23></a></p>

<p class=tat>Even before Angada landed there, Sugreeva, the king of monkeys
spoke to the louts-eyed Rama, who was afflicted with grief (as follows): <a
name=Verse24></a>&quot;Be pacified! Happiness to you! The princess has been
seen. There is not doubt. When the time earlier fixed by us exceeds beyond
limit, it is not possible for them to come here. 
Angada,
the long-armed prince and the most excellent of monkeys does not make his
appearance before my vicinity, if the work is ruined. 
Even
if such an exploit may be possible by these monkeys who have not been able to
accomplish their work, Angada would have worn a sad face and felt perplexed and
scattered in mind.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;If Angada the lord f the monkeys is not
rejoiced, he would not have damaged my madhuvana, which belongs to my father
and grandfather as well as protected by my forbears. Get consoled well, O
virtuous Rama, the splendid son of Kausalya! 
Seetha was
seen. There is no doubt. None other than Hanuma must have seen Seetha. There is
indeed none other than Hanuma, who is the executor.&#8221;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;O Rama, having a very good
understanding! In Hanuma, qualities like capacity to accomplish any object,
intelligence, strenuous effort and vigour are unchangeable, like a splendour in
the sun. 
Where Jambavan is a leader; Angada as the
commander of troops and moreover Hanuma as the administer, the progress of that
work cannot be as otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>
&quot;O Rama, of unlimited
prowess! Do not encounter troubled thoughts now!&quot; Meanwhile, when the
monkeys, who are proud of Hanuma's performance and who are making noise as
though they are proclaiming about the accomplishment of their act are
approaching Kishkindha Sugreeva heard certain sounds expressing joy, in the
vicinity of the sky.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>Then, hearing that clamour of the monkeys,
Sugreeva the chief of the monkeys became rejoiced at heart, duly stretching and
curling up his tail (in joy). 
Keeping Angada and Hanuma in
front of them, those monkeys too arrived with their eagerness to see Rama.</p>

<p class=tat>Those heroes, having Angada as their chief,
exceedingly pleased as they were and filled with joy, landed at the vicinity of
Sugreeva and Rama. 
Thereafter, the mighty armed Hanuma,
offering his salutation in bending his head low, informed Rama that Seetha the
princess is constant in devotion to Rama and sound in body.</p>

<p class=tat>Hearing the nectar-like words, saying
&quot;Seetha was found&quot; from the mouth of Hanuma, Rama and Lakshmana felt
happy. 
Thereupon, Lakshmana with love looked with reverence
on the joyful Sugreeva, who earlier decidedly apprised about the aforesaid
Hanuma, having accomplished the task. 
Rama, the annihilator
of hostile heroes, who obtained a great joy, looked on Hanuma with a high
esteem.</p>
