	<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose Sarga3</h3>

				<p class="txt">In this chapter Hanuma faces Lanka, the city of Lanka
  				herself in the form of a demoness.</p>

<p class="txt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="verloc">---</p>

	<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">That Hanuma, best among monkeys, the intellectual son of Vayu, one with great might, 
	stood on the mountain called Lamba with its high peaks equaling a high cloud, gathered courage and 
	entered at night the city of Lanka
	ruled by Ravana and filled with beautiful forests and places of water such as lakes. The city of 
	Lanka was shone by buildings equaling autumnal clouds. With a sound resembling that 
	of an ocean, it was served by ocean breeze. It was filled with well fed and mighty armies like Vitapati, 
	the capital of Kubera. It had elephants positioned at archways and had white gates and archways. Quickly 
	approaching that city of Lanka which was protected by Rakshasas, like the auspicious city of Bhogavati 
	being protected by serpents moving about, spread with cloud illumined by flashes of lightening, served by 
	pathways of stars, with a light breeze like the Indra&#39;s city of Amaravati, surrounded by a wall 
	with a golden hue, decorated by flags with sounds from groups of small bells. He became happy and leapt up 
	the wall.</p>

	<p class="tat">Seeing the city everywhere Hanuma became surprised at heart. Thereafter Hanuma the monkey, 
	became happy seeing the doors which were of golden color, with platforms of cat&#39;s eye gems, inlaid with diamonds, 
	crystals and pearls, embellished with floors of gems, graced with elephants made of refined gold, crowned 
	with spotless white silver, stairs studded with cat&#39;s eye gems, with inside walls made of crystal free from 
	dust, provided with lovely assembly halls, with sounds of Krauncha birds and peacocks, served by royal 
	swans, looking as though flying toward the sky, with auspicious houses resounding everywhere with the sounds 
	of clarionets and ornaments, equaling the city of Vasvaukasaara, as though flying towards the 
	sky.</p>

	<p class="tat">Seeing that city of Ravana, which was best among 
	cities, a wealthy city, a beautiful and auspicious city, that powerful Hanuma thought thus. &quot;It is not possible 
	for anyone else to oppose this city, by strength alone, which is being guarded by armies of Ravana with raised 
	weapons. This land may be conquerable by Kumuda or Angada, to the great monkey Sushena or to 
	Mainda or Dvivida. There may be access to this land to the son of Sun God Sugreeva, to the monkey 
	Kusaparvana, to the chief among monkeys Riksha and to me.&quot; Considering the long armed Sri Rama&#39;s 
	strength and Lakshmana&#39;s valour, Hanuma became happy.</p>

	<p class="tat">That great monkey saw that city of king of rakshasas like a wealthy woman decorated 
	with diamonds for her clothes, with various storage houses as earrings, with amouries for her breasts. 
	Due to the lamps that illuminated the radiant great houses, all darkness was lost. Thereafter, the guardian 
	of that city, in her own form, saw Hanuma, the best among monkeys and the mighty one, 
	entering. Seeing that best among monkeys Hanuma there, that Lanka ruled by Ravana, 
	rose up herself with a horrific appearance of face an eyes. She stood in front of the best among Vanaras 
	Hanuma. She made a great sound and spoke to Hanuma thus. &quot;O one who lives in gardens! 
	Who are you? For what reason did you come here? As long as your lives are sustained, tell me the truth here 
	before that. It is indeed not possible for you to enter this city of Lanka
	which is protected by Ravana&#39;s forces and strongly guarded all around.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Thereafter the mighty Hanuma spoke to Lanka standing in front of Him as follows: &quot;Whatever 
	matter you are asking me, I will tell you that truthfully. You are standing at the entrance to the city. O 
	one with ugly eyes! Who are you? O horrible one! Stopping me, for what reason are you threatening me? 
	</p>

	<p class="tat">Listening to Hanuma&#39;s words, that Lanka, with ability to achieve desired form, became 
	angry and spoke these strong words to Hanuma. &quot;I protect this city, being invincible. I wait for the orders 
	of the king of demons Ravana, the great one. After humiliating me it is not possible for you to enter the 
	city. Being beaten by me, you will leave life and have a permanent sleep. O Vanara! I am protecting 
	this city of Lanka in all directions. This matter has been already 
	told to you by me.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">The son of Vayu and best among Vanaras heard Lanka&#39;s words and stood up like 
	a second mountain, with a purpose. Thereafter that Hanuma the wise one, with great strength, best among those 
	who can fly and best among Vanaras, saw that city of Lanka in the form of an ugly woman and spoke thus. 
	&quot;I should like to see the city of Lanka
	with its palaces, defensive walls and archways. I came here for that reason. I am very curious to see them. 
	My arrival here is indeed to see Lanka&#39;s gardens, parks, forests and important houses all over.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Listening to Hanuma&#39;s words, Lanka with the ability to assume desired
	form, spoke harsh words stronger than before. &quot;O lowly Vanara with an evil 
	mind! It is not possible for you to see this city ruled by king of rakshasas, without first defeating 
	me.&quot; </p>

	<p class="tat">Then that tiger among Vanaras Hanuma spoke to that demon: &quot;O auspicious one! After seeing 
	this city I will return back again to where I came from.&quot;</p>

	<p class="tat">Thereafter that Lanka made a great sound causing terror and hit Hanuma, the best among Vanaras, 
	with her palm quickly. Then that tiger among Vanaras, the powerful son of Vayu, 
	being hit powerfully by Lanka made a great sound. Hanuma became dizzy with anger and folded his fingers 
	of left hand. He then hit her with His fist. &quot;She is a woman&quot; - thinking thus He did not 
	show much anger by Himself. That demon fell on land immediately by that hit with a distressed body 
	and appeared with a horrific face. Then the intellectual and glorious Hanuma saw her fallen down and thinking 
	her to be woman, showed kindness. Lanka being very gloomy spoke with a flattering tone without pride these 
	words to Hanuma the Vanara. </p>



	<p class="tat">&quot;O long armed one! O best among Vanaras! Get propitiated and protect me. O gentle one! 
	Those with great strength and courage always stand firm on tradition. I am myself the city of 
	Lanka. I am defeated by your strength. In earlier times I had been given a boon by 
	Lord Brahma. Hear from me about this matter. Let this be known by you - whenever a Vanara conquers 
	you with his might, then a fear will come for Rakshasas. O gentle one! With 
	your appearance now, that time has come for me. Ordinance of Brahma is the truth and is immutable. The destruction 
	has come for Ravana the evil minded king and to all Rakshasas due to Seetha. For that reason, enter 
	the city of Lanka
	ruled by Ravana and do here whatever tasks you want to. Enter the auspicious city of 
	Lanka stuck by the curse, ruled by the king of Rakshasas, roam everywhere and 
	search for the chaste wife Seetha according to your comfort.&quot;</p>
