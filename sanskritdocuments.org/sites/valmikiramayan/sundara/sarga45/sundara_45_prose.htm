<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 45</h3>

<p class="txt">The seven sons of Prahasta surrounded by a great army rush in speedy chariots upon Hanuma, 
who is standing on the archy gate way. They discharge a shower of arrows on Hanuma. Then, Hanuma crushes 
all the enemies, using his palms, feet, fists, nails, chest and thighs only as his weapons. After killing 
those demons, Hanuma climbs up the archy door-way and takes up his position there again.</p>

<p class="tat">Thereafter, those seven sons of his chief minister having a lustre similar to that of 
fire, surrounded by a great army, wielding their respective bows, possessing a great strength, well-trained 
in archery and the best among knower of weapons, wishing a victory reciprocally, having an immense prowess 
each, and as directed by Ravana, started highly delighted from that palace, in great chariots yoked 
with horses. Those chariots were having a noise similar to that of an autumnal cloud, overlaid with 
a protective armour of gold, surmounted by banners and decorated with smaller flags. They were stretching 
their bows inlaid with refined gold and looking colourful like clouds accompanied by flashes of lightning.</p>

<p class="tat">Coming to know that Kimkaras themselves were killed their mothers together with their 
relatives and friends were tormented with grief. Those sons of chief minister, wearing ornaments made 
of pure gold, rushed towards Hanuma, who was ready for battle and who stood on the archy gate-way motionless. 
Those demons looking like clouds, diffusing thunder-like sounds of their chariots and discharging a 
shower of arrows, moved in different directions resembling rainy clouds in the monsoon. </p>

<p class="tat">Thus covered by those showers of arrows, Hanuma became invisible even as a mountain-king 
is concealed by incessant showers. Roaming about in a cloudless sky, that fast-footed monkey made the 
arrows and the speedy chariots of those virile demons, useless. </p>

<p class="tat">Playing with those demons wielding a bow each in the sky, that hero shone like the Lord 
of Wind, playing with clouds brandishing a rain bow.</p>

<p class="tat">Making a terrific roar and frightening that great army, the valiant Hanuma rushed on 
those demons. That Hanuma, the annihilator of enemies, struck some with his palms, some with his feet 
and some others with his fists. He tore down some others with his nails.</p>

<p class="tat">Hanuma crushed some with his chest and some others with his thighs. Some fell down there 
itself on the ground, just by the roar made by Hanuma. Seeing those demons dying and falling on the 
ground, all the remaining army, afflicted with fear, fled in ten different directions.</p>

<p class="tat">Their elephants trumpeted with a wrong accent. Horses fell down on the ground. Even the 
earth was filled with chariots which had their seats, banners and canopies broken. Thereafter, streams 
flowing with blood were seen on the way. Lanka resounded with various kinds of horrible voices. That 
heroic and mighty Hanuma having a terrible prowess, killing those arrogant demons and being desirous 
of a combat with the other demons, again reached that archy door way itself. </p>
