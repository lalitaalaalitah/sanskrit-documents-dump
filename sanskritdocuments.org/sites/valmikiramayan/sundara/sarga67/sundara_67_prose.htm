<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 67</h3>

<p class="txt">Hanuma narrates at length an incident connected with a crow that occurred during the 
sojourn of Seetha with Rama at Chitrakuta, which was related by Seetha by way of a token of remembrance. 
Seetha then describes her miserable state to Hanuma and requests him to ask Rama, Lakshmana and Sugreeva 
to come to Lanka to destroy Ravana together with his army. Hanuma consoles Seetha, saying that Rama 
and Lakshmana would reduce Lanka to ashes and take her back to Ayodhya. When Hanuma further requests 
Seetha to give a token of remembrance to be handed over to Rama, she gives him a jewel for the head 
as a token.</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing the words of the high-souled Rama, Hanuma reported to Rama, all the words spoken 
by Seetha.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O Rama the foremost of men! Seetha, the princess, spoke a detailed account of an event 
which occurred long ago in Mount Chitrakuta, as a token of recollection. Seetha, who slept happily by 
your side (at one instance) got up before you. A crow coming down quickly tore her flesh at an area 
in the midst of her breasts (with its beak). O Rama! You slept in your turn on 
the lap of the princess. That crow again began to torment the princess. Coming near again and again, 
it toe her breast severely. Dampened by her blood, you then were awakened by her. O tormentator of enemies! 
Though lying happily asleep, you were awakened by Seetha the princess, who was being ceaselessly tormented 
by the crow. O long-armed Rama! Seeing her, who was lacerated at the midst of her breasts, you were 
enraged like a hissing snake and spoke to her as follows. &#39;O bashful Seetha! By whom was the middle 
of your breasts lacerated with nail-points? Who is playing with an angry five-hooded serpent? Looking 
around, you suddenly saw a crow, which perched in front of Seetha, with its sharp nails stained with 
blood. That crow, foremost of the birds was indeed the son of Indra the lord of celestials; dwelling 
in the middle of the mountains and equal in speed to the wind.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O great armed Rama, the excellent among the wise! With your eyes rolling with anger, 
you then harboured a cruel intention against that crow. Taking a blade of grass from your bed of the 
sacred grass, you charged it with the potency of Brahma missile. That flaming blade blazed forth like 
the fire of universal dissolution, with its end facing the bird. You hurled that flaming blade of grass 
towards the crow. Then that flaming blade of grass for its part followed the crow. Forsaken by all the 
celestials, Indra, its father and the sages too, that crow did not find a protector even after going 
round all the three worlds (heaven, earth and the lower regions).&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O destroyer of enemies! Being frightened the crow came to your presence once again and 
sough your protection. Though fit to be killed, you on your part, affording shelter, in mercy to the 
crow, protected that crow which had fallen flat on the ground. O Rama! Since it is not possible to make 
the missile a waste, you destroyed the right eye of the crow.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O Rama! Then, that crow, having been discharged by you, went back to its own habitation, 
after offering salutation to you and to king Dasaratha. Why are you not employing the same type of a 
missile on the demons, though you are the foremost among the wielders of missiles, though courageous 
and possessed of good disposition?&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Neither the Nagas the celestials serpents nor even Gandharvas the celestial musicians 
nor the demons nor the troop of Maruts the host of gods, nor all of them joined together are capable 
of fighting with Rama. If that powerful Rama is eager to save me, let him kill Ravana in battle quickly 
with his exceptionally sharp arrows.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Why even that Lakshmana, the annihilator of adversaries and the foremost of men born 
in Raghu dynasty is not saving me, by taking orders from Rama his brother? Wherefore those two competent 
brothers Rama and Lakshmana, with their splendour equal to that of air and fire, and excellent among 
men, even though they can conquer the celestials, are ignoring me? There is no doubt that I had done 
some big impure act, for which reason those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana, who torment the enemies, 
even though capable, are not paying attention to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing the miserable words of Seetha spoken with tears, I again spoke to that venerable 
Seetha the following words:</p>

<p class="tat">“‘O Seetha the princess! Rama has grown indifferent because of grief born of separation 
from you. I swear it to you truly. Rama, being overwhelmed with grief, Lakshmana too is feeling pain.
You have been discovered somehow. This is not a time to lament. You will see the 
end of your sorrows during this very moment&#39;.Those two princes, the foremost 
among men and the faultless ones are eager to see you. They can reduce Lanka to ashes. O lady with charming 
hips! Killing the terrific Ravana together with his relatives in battle, Rama will certainly take you 
to his City of Ayodhya&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">“‘O faultless one! You can give now, a token of recollection, which Rama can recognize 
and which can beget happiness to him. Having surveyed all the directions and having untied from the 
end of her garment, this excellent jewel which was being strung together in her hair that Seetha gave 
it to me. O Rama! Taking that wonderful jewel for your sake from her, and offering my salutation by 
bowing my head to that venerable Seetha, I was seized with a haste to come back. Seeing me who was in 
a hurry to come back and augmenting my body abundantly, Seetha having a beautiful complexion spoke to 
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">With her eyes filled with tears, looking miserable, with her words ambiguously coming 
out of her coked throat, bewildered as she was, at the though of my flying away and afflicted with a 
gush of grief; (she spoke to me as follows):</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O Hanuma! Inquire those two brothers Rama and Lakshmana looking like lions, Sugreeva 
together with his ministers and all others about their welfare. You ought to clear 
up difficulties for that mighty armed Rama, so that he can help me to cross this ocean of sorrow. O 
best of heroes among monkeys! Approaching Rama, tell this horrible gush of my grief and the threats 
of these female-demons. Have a happy journey! O illustrious princes, the protector of men! The venerable 
Seetha filled with sorrow spoke these words to be conveyed to you. Comprehending this matter spoken 
by me, believe that Seetha is completely safe.&quot;</p>
