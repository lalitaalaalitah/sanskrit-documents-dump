	<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
	<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 57</h3>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>

	<p class="txt">Hanuma leaps from the coast of Lanka and touches Mount Mainaka, which he came across 
	in the way. He advances further and roars at the top of his voice at the Mount Mahendra, so as to 
	bring jubiliation to the monkeys awaiting his return there. Jambavan tells the monkeys, who moved 
	by jumps with joy on hearing Jambavan, that Hanuma has returned successfully, from his expedition 
	as way evident from his jubilant roar. Having greeted Jambavan, Angada and others on alighting on 
	the summit of Mount Mahendra, Hanuma narrates to them briefly the story of his discovery of Seetha. 
	Applauding Hanuma, prince Angada, who was eager to hear the story, sits down on a rock along with 
	all others.</p>
