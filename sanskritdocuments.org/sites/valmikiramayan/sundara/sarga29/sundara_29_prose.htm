<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 29</h3>

<p class="txt">Seetha experiences some good omens as follows; Her left eye, left shoulder and left thigh quivered, 
as also her clothing slipped a bit. Feeling these omens, her consciousness was awakened with exaltation.</p>

<p class="tat">To her who was in such circumstances, who was in distress, who was irreproachable, devoid of joy 
and dejected but virtuous, was bestowed with auspicious omens, as a prosperous man is bestowed with dependent 
servants. The beautifully haired Seetha&#39;s left eye, which was auspicious, whose surrounding row of eye-lashes 
were curved, which was black, wide and bright-looking; was predominantly quivering, like a red lotus quivered 
by the blow of a fish.</p>

<p class="tat">Her left shoulder, which was pretty, distinguished beefy and round, which deserved to be applied 
with excellent black aloe and sandalwood paste, which had been used for long as a pillow by her most excellently 
beloved Rama, quickly quivered. Of her two thighs kept together, the left thighs which was beefy and well born, 
which resembled the trunk of a princely elephant was predominantly quivering, spoke indistinctly of existence 
of Rama in front.</p>

<p class="tat">Again, the clothing of Seetha standing there, of spotless eyes and charming limbs, having teeth 
resembling the buds of jasmine, which was of golden shade and was slightly soiled as it were with dust, glided 
down, which appeared auspicious (for her). Bolstered by these and some other omens which straight explained that 
they were fruitful on the earlier occasion also, Seetha of beautiful eyebrows disclosed a great joy, even as a 
seed vanished and withered by the wind and the sun, got sprouted by rain.</p>

<p class="tat">Moreover, having the lips resembling Bimba fruit, having beautiful eyes and eyebrows, whose eye 
lids are curved, having charming white teeth, her face shone like the moon liberated from the mouth of the demon 
Rahu. Free from sorrow, her weariness removed, her mental affliction alleviated and her consciousness awakened 
with exaltation, that esteemed lady (Seetha) looked handsome with her countenance, as a night with the moon appears 
during the bright fortnight.</p>

sage and the oldest epic.</h4>
