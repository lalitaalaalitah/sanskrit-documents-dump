<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 7</h3>
<p class="txt">Hanuma continues his search for mother Seetha in Ravana's inner city. He sees the
aerial plane Pushpaka in Ravana's building.</p>
<p align="center" class="verloc"> </p>
<p class="tat">Hanuma, the strong one, saw a group of houses with windows in golden hue, embedded
with cat's-eye gems, like a great group of clouds in rainy season with lighting, together with a
group of birds. He saw various halls of the houses, important buildings storing conches, bows, and
other weapons, and also heartening spacious attics at the top of mountain- like houses. He saw
houses glittered by various riches, well worshipped by Devas and Asuras, devoid of all flaws and
obtained by the self-might of rakshasas. He saw those houses of the ruler of Lanka, constructed by
great effort as though constructed by Mayaa himself on earth with all best qualities.</p>
<p class="tat">Thereafter Hanuma saw the best house of the lord of rakshasas, having the appearance
of a cloud, soul-captivating one having a beautiful form made of gold which has no comparison,
suitable of Ravana's might. The son of Vayu Hanuma saw Ravana's house like heaven thrown upon
earth, effulgent with glory, embedded with variety of diamonds covered by flowers of various trees,
like the summit of a mountain covered by pollen. Being shone by the best among women like a cloud
by lightening, being worshipped, like being carried by the best swans, like an aerial car full of
splendor, of good people in sky. He saw the best house like a beautiful cloud endowed with many
hues, like the sky illumined by planets including the moon, decked with numerous precious stones
like a mountain peak, looking picturesque with numerous minerals. The earth was made to be full of
mountain ranges. The mountains were made to be abounded of trees. The trees were made to be full of
flowers. The flower was made to be full of filaments and petals. White mansions were also built in
the same way. Lakes also with beautiful flowers and also lotuses together with filaments and forest
that were the best and wonderful.</p>
<p class="tat">There the great Hanuma saw a great aerial car, the best among best of aerial cars,
shining with the name of Pushpaka with the rays of precious stones, and capable of traveling long
distances. Artificial birds made of cat's-eye gems, as well as birds made of silver and coral,
wonderful serpants made of various jewels, horses of beautiful limbs suitable by their noble breed
were arranged. Birds were made with corals on their wings and together with golden flowers, with
good wings, with curved and bent wings in a playful way, shining like helpers of the god of love
himself. Images of elephants in a lotus-pool with filaments of lotus on body, with lotus petals
held in their trunks, were devoted to the worship of an image of Goddess Lakshmi. And also an image
of Goddess Lakshmi with four graceful hands and holding lotus in Her hand was made to exist in
Pushpaka.</p>
<p class="tat">Then that Hanuma nearing that city of Lanka worshipped by Rakshasas ruled by arms of
ten-headed Ravana moving thereabout became very gloomy on not seeing that Seetha well worshipped by
all. Greatly conquered by the virtues of Her husband Sri Rama</p>
<p class="tat">Thereafter Hanuma nearing that city of Lanka worshipped by Rakshasas, ruled by arms
of ten-headed Ravana, moving thereabout became very gloomy on not seeing that Seetha well
worshipped by all and greatly conquered by the virtues of Her husband Sri Rama  Thereafter then the
heart of the great souled Hanuma who contemplated supreme spirit in many ways with a disciplined
mind following righteous path, with good observant eyes, moving about in the city of Lanka became
greatly sorrowful on not seeing Seetha.</p>
