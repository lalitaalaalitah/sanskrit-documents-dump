<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 60</h3>

<p class="txt">
Angada suggest with enthusiasm that Seetha must be restored by them only, after conquering Lanka. But 
Jambavan replies that it is not proper for them to do like that; without enquiring about Rama&#39;s intention.</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing those words of Hanuma, Angada the son of Vali spoke as follows: &quot;Even after our 
seeing of Seetha, it is not proper for us to approach the high-souled Rama without taking Seetha with 
us. I perceive it as improper to inform there that Seetha the princess, though seen by you of renowned 
prowess, has not been brought here.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;O the best of monkeys! No one is equal to us even in our prowess nor indeed anyone who 
can leap like us in the worlds either of celestials or demons. Hanuma indeed thus killed all the warriors 
among the demons. What work is remaining to be done by us? We will go, after taking Janaki.&quot; </p>

<p class="tat">Jambavan, the foremost among the forest-animals, understanding the sense, was very much 
pleased and spoke the following meaningful words to that Angada, who thus formed a resolution.
&quot;O prince! This thought you thus perceive is not incompetent of us. But, you must 
see the way in which Rama&#39;s inclination would be, for the accomplishment of the object.&quot;</p>

<h4>Thus completes 60th Chapter of Sundara Kanda of the glorious Ramayana of Valmiki, the 
work of a sage and the oldest epic.</h4>
