<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 49</h3>

<p class="txt">
Hanuma sees well-adorned Ravana, who is seated on a well-decorated throne of crystal. He 
is surrounded by four ministers viz., Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparshva and Nikumbha. Surprised to behold 
the splendor and glory of Ravana, Hanuma believes that he could even rule heaven along with Indra, but 
for his gross unrighteousness, which pulled him down.</p>

<p class="tat">Then, Hanuma with a terrific prowess, was enraged (at his capture and his being dragged) 
and saw Ravana with his red hot eyes. He was surprised by that deed of Indrajit. Ravana was endowed 
with a great splendor and shone with a glittering and precious diadem of gold as also encircled with 
strings of pearls.</p>

<p class="tat">That Ravana was adorned with bright-coloured gold ornaments, inlaid with diamonds and 
decorated with worthy gems, which appeared as though they were prepared with the mind. Ravana was attired 
in very costly silk and his body was smeared with red-sandal paste and well painted with various brightly 
coloured designs. Ravana looked strange with his ten heads, having terrible-looking 
yet good-looking pair of red eyes each, with brilliant sharp enormous teeth and protruding lips, like 
a daring demon endowed with extra ordinary vigour, shining brightly as Mount Mandara with its peaks 
and infested with snakes of different varieties. </p>

<p class="tat">Ravana was having a pearl necklace casting its splendor on his bosom. He was looking 
like a mass of blue antimony, but with his countenance shining like the full moon and appearing like 
a cloud illumined by the rising sun. He was distinguished by (twenty) arms, adorned with bracelets, 
smeared with excellent sandal-paste and decked with shining Angadas another variety of bracelets and 
looking like large five-hooded serpents.</p>

<p class="tat">He was comfortably seated on a big excellent throne of crystal, rendered picturesque 
by being embedded with jewels and overspread with an exquisite covering. He was duly waited upon at 
close quarters on all sides by young ladies, well-adorned and with whisks in their hands. He was proud 
of his might and had four counselors sitting nearby, all belonging to the demonical race and who knew 
the secret of good counsel, viz. Durdhara, Prahasta, Mahaparshva the demon and the counselor Nikumbha 
and looked like the entire terrestrial globe enclosed by four oceans.</p>

<p class="tat">He was being reassured by counselors knowing the secret of good counsel and other demons 
with auspicious minds, as Indra the lord of celestials is reassured by celestials. Hanuma saw Ravana 
with a great splendor, sitting on the throne, looking like a rainy cloud on the peak of Mount Meru. 
Though tortured by the demons that Hanuma, of terrific prowess, experiencing a great surprise, looked 
attentively at Ravana. </p>

<p class="tat">Seeing the glittering Ravana, the king of demons, Hanuma was bewildered by his splendor 
and thought in his mind as follows: “What figure, what courage, what strength, what splendor and what 
amalgam of auspicious marks, alas, this king of demons has! Had this lord of demons perhaps not strong 
in unrighteousness, he would have been a protector of even the world of celestials together with Indra 
the lord of celestials. By his cruel and violent acts despised by the world, all people including gods 
and demons indeed remain frightened of him. If enraged he is indeed capable to turn the entire world 
into a single ocean.” Seeing the power of Ravana the king of demons, who possessed an unlimited vigour, 
the intelligent Hanuma formulated many kinds of thoughts in this way. </p>
