<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 63</h3>

<p class="tat">Dadhimukha comes to Sugreeva and reports that Madhuvana, the grove abounding in honey, 
has been damaged by monkeys headed by Angada and Hanuma. When Lakshmana in the vicinity enquires Sugreeva 
about the matter, Sugreeva says that by hearing about the jubilation of the monkeys, it can be concluded 
that Seetha has been traced out. Assuaging Dadhimukha, Sugreeva asks him to send without delay, Hanuma, 
Angada and others to him, so as to hear about their efforts in tracing out Seetha.</p>

<br>

<p class="verloc">-----------</p>

<br>

<p class="tat">Just on seeing Dadhimukha, who fell touching his feet with his head, Sugreeva the chief 
of monkeys, with an agitated mind, spoke the following words: &quot;O valiant monkey! Stand up, rise! Why 
have you fallen on my feet? I grant you immunity from fear. Let the entire truth be spoken!&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Thus inspired by the high-souled Sugreeva with confidence, that highly intelligent Dadhimukha, 
rising up, spoke the following words: &quot;O king! Madhuvana was indeed not set free previously at any time 
by Riksharajas, your father, nor by you, nor by even Vali. That Madhuvana has been consumed away by 
the monkeys. When these guards of the grove obstructed the monkeys, they disregarded the guards and 
continue to eat the fruits and drink the honey too. Some are throwing away a remnant of honey, after 
drinking it there and some others are consuming that remnant. When prevented by us, all of them are 
indeed exhibiting their eye-brows to us (in anger).&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;When these guards of the grove became angry and tried to keep them off from the grove, 
those enraged monkeys threatened them. O chief of monkeys! Then, those valiant monkeys in large numbers, 
having their red eyes in anger, drove away these monkeys. Those monkeys struck some of the guards with 
their hands. They beat some of them with their knees. They dragged some of them and tossed them into 
air. While you are in the position of a king, those monkeys have beaten these valiant guards and are 
eating away the entire Maduvana too.”</p>

<p class="tat">Lakshmana, the killer of hostile heroes and a very wise man, asked that Sugreeva, the 
excellent of monkeys (as follows) while Dadhimukha was thus reporting to him: &quot;O king! Why has this 
monkey the garden-protector, come here?&#39; Pointing out what matter has this monkey in grief, spoken these 
words to you?”</p>

<p class="tat">Hearing the words of the high-souled Lakshmana, the eloquent Sugreeva replied to him 
as follows: &quot;O esteemed Lakshmana! Dadhimukha, the valiant monkey is informing that the foremost of 
monkeys, who returned from the southern direction, after searching for Seetha as also Angada and other 
heroes consumed honey. By seeing the manner in which these returned monkeys overpowered, destroyed and 
behaved towards Madhuvana, we can deduce that the monkeys would not have indulged in such an exploit, 
had they not accomplished my purpose.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;When those monkeys have overpowered Madhuvana, then it means that our task has been 
accomplished by the monkeys. Seetha was found. There is no doubt. None other than Hanuma must have seen 
Seetha. There is none other than, Hanuma who is the executor in accomplishing this work. In that Hanuma, 
the foremost among the monkeys, capacity to accomplish any object; intelligence; strenuous, vigour effort; 
and learning are well established in his life. Where Jambavan as well as Angada are leaders and Hanuma 
is an administrator, the progress of that work cannot be as otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;It is so reported that Madhuvana has been destroyed by the heroes with Angada as the 
chief and the garden-guards who were together preventing the damage, were beaten up with knees. To tell 
this matter in sweet words, the monkey renowned by Dadhimukha by name, with his celebrated prowess, 
has come here. O the long-armed Lakshmana! Perceive the truth that Seetha has been seen and see that 
all monkeys, getting together, are drinking honey. O Lakshmana, the foremost among men! If the renowned 
monkeys have not seen Seetha, they would not have abused the charming grove; which was granted as a 
boon. </p>

<p class="tat">Then, the righteous Lakshmana, together with Rama, felt delighted. Hearing the words 
coming from the mouth of Sugreeva, which were pleasant for the ears, Rama was rejoiced. The mighty Lakshmana 
too was very much rejoiced. </p>

<p class="tat">Hearing those words of Dadhimukha, Sugreeva with a charming neck, was very much pleased 
and further spoke to Dadhimukha, the guardian of the grove (as follows): &quot;I am happy that Madhuvana 
has been enjoyed by those monkeys, who have accomplished their act. Since the act (damage to the grove) 
done by those monkeys, who have accomplished their purpose is fit to be forgiven, I pardon them. I, 
together with Rama and Lakshmana, soon desire to see those monkeys, with Hanuma as their chief, who 
having acquired the pride of a lion and who attained his purpose; and also to hear about their effort 
in finding out Seetha.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">Seeing Rama and Lakshmana with their eyes filled with ecstatic delight, the princes, 
who were thrilled with joy and who accomplished their aim, Sugreeva that king of the monkeys was very 
much delighted, knowing that accomplishment of their work is coming close to their hands and his limbs 
were thrilled with joy. </p>
