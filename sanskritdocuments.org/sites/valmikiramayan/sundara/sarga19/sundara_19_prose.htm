<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Sundara Kanda in Prose</h3>
<h3>Sarga 19</h3>

<p class="txt">In this chapter Valmiki describes the plight of Seetha in Ashoka garden in detail.<br></p>

<p class="verloc">- - - </p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">Thereafter me Seetha a princess without any blame of excellent limbs shook like a plantain tree 
in wind on seeing Ravana the king of rakshasas endowed with beauty and youth adorned with excellent ornaments. 
The wide eyed Seetha with excellent color covering stomach with thighs and breasts with hands sat down crying.</p>

<p class="tat">Ravana saw Seetha protected by batches of ogres looking miserable being struck with grief like 
a ship in danger in the sea. Hanuma saw Seetha sitting down on uncovered land, with a firm resolve, like a branch 
of a tree fallen down on earth being torn from the tree.</p>

<p class="tat">Hanuma saw Seetha with a strange body with dirt as ornament, who although suited to decorate with 
ornaments was without ornaments. Although She was shining like a lotus stem covered with mud, She was not shining 
also. Seetha was as though going near to Rama a lion among kings with a famous personality with desires as chariot 
tied with thoughts as horses. Seetha a pleasant one, was emaciated, was crying, being alone having surrendered 
to Her thoughts and sorrow not seeing the end of grief, following the will of Rama.</p>

<p class="tat">And also Seetha was like a great she-serpent writhing under the spell of an incantation. She was 
like Rohini being fumigated by a smoke colored planet called Ketu. Being born in a virtuous traditional family 
with good conduct and character and getting married, Seetha appeared as if She was born in a bad family.</p>

<p class="tat">Seetha was like fame fallen down due to false blame. She was like education ruined due to lack 
of learning by heart. Seetha was like deteriorated great fame, like insulted faith, like an understanding grown 
feeble, like dulled hope.</p>

<p class="tat">Seetha was like an expectation destroyed, like an order flouted; like a blazing quarter during 
a period of destruction, like a worship stolen. Seetha was like a lotus destroyed, like an army with killed warriors, 
like light destroyed by darkness, like vanished river. Seetha was like an altar desecrated, like a tongue of fire 
gone out, like a full moon night with moon devoured by Rahu.</p>

<p class="tat">Seetha was like a lotus pond agitated with torned out leaves and lotuses, being roughly treated 
by the trunk of an elephant. Grieved for husband, Seetha was like a river which has dried up with water caused 
to flow out lacking best washing, was like a new moon night.</p>

<p class="tat">Seetha was a delicate one with well built limbs, accustomed to houses full of diamonds, being tormented 
by heat, like a lotus fiber uprooted short time back. Seetha was like a she-elephant captured and tied to a pillar, 
made to be without the leader of herd, sighing, very much tormented by grief. With a long single plait, shining 
without effort, Seetha was like the earth with dark groups of trees at the end of rainy season. Wasted, emaciated 
due to fasting, due to sorrow, due to thought and due to fear, Seetha was with limited food and with austerity 
as wealth. Seetha was like a celestial being, tormented by grief and by thought with joined palms, desiring the 
defeat of Ravana at the hands of Sri Rama. </p>

<p class="tat">Ravana was trying to allure and threatening death to Seetha who was looking at every direction, 
crying, without blame, with good eye lids and reddish and white eyes, with an excessive vow to follow Sri Rama.
