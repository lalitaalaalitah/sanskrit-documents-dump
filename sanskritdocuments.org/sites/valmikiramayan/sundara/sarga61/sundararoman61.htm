	<p class="txt">Leaving Mount Mahendra and leaping ahead towards Kishkindha, the monkeys on their 
	way halt at Madhuvana, a protected grove abounded in honey which was dear to Sugreeva and guarded 
	by the monkey, Dahimukha. When the monkeys started to enjoy drinking of honey in the grove with 
	the permission of Prince Angada, Dahimukha hinders in their way. The monkeys bruise Dadhimukha with 
	their nails and teeth.</p>
