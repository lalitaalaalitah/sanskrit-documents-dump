<p class="txt">Leaving Mount Mahendra and leaping ahead towards Kishkindha, the monkeys on their way 
halt at Madhuvana, a protected grove abounded in honey which was dear to Sugreeva and guarded by the 
monkey, Dahimukha. When the monkeys started to enjoy drinking of honey in the grove with the permission 
of Prince Angada, Dahimukha hinders in their way. The monkeys bruise Dadhimukha with their nails and 
teeth.</p>
