<p class=tat>After that, Hanuma, the destroyer of foes, desired to travel in
the sky where celestials like 
chaaranas</span> tread, to
search for Seetha, who was taken away by Ravana. 
<span
class=GramE>Hanuma</span> who desired to perform a deed done by no one else,
shone like a bull without any obstacles, with his stretched neck and raised
head.</p>

<p class=tat>After that, the mighty and courageous Hanuma
roamed at ease on the lawns with the hue of an emerald, which looked like still
water from a distance. 
The thoughtful Hanuma tread like a
rampant lion, making birds fear, uprooting trees by his breast and also killing
many animals.</p>

<p class=tat>

That
great monkey Hanuma shone like an elephant in a lake, standing on the foot of
that great mountain by the name of 
Mahendra</span>, where
many elephants of good breed resided, which was beautifully decorated with many
naturally formed mineral rocks of varied hue like black, white, red, blue,
yellow and green and which was surrounded by godly serpents and 
Yakshas</span>, 
Kinnaras</span>, 
Gandharvas</span> who were capable of assuming desired form,
together with their families.</p>

<p class=tat>He saluted with joined palms to the Sun-God,
Lord Indra, God of Wind, Lord Brahma and 
Bhutas</span> and
decided to leave. 
Hanuma turned towards east, saluted his
father, the Lord of Wind and increased his body to go towards southern
direction. 
With all the 
Vaanaras</span>
seeing, Hanuma decided to fly and like an ocean swelling on full moon days,
grew for Rama's success.</p>

<p class=tat>With a desire to cross the ocean, Hanuma grew
his body immeasurably and pressed the mountain with his feet and hands. <a
name=Verse12></a>Thus tormented by Hanuma, that mountain shook for an instant
and showered all flowers of trees on it.</p>

<p class=tat>Covered all through by those fragrant flowers
which fell down from the trees, that mountain shone like a mountain made of
flowers. 
That mountain shed water like an elephant in rut
emitting rut juice, after being pressed by the mighty Hanuma. 
Pressed
by that mighty Hanuma, streaks of gold silver and antimony color appeared on
the 
Mahendra</span> <span class=GramE>mountain</span>.</p>

<p class=tat>Huge Rocks of Sulfur were also shot forth from
that mountain, just as a fire burning with a medium flame would emit columns of
smoke. 
Being pressed on all sides by the mountain which
itself was being pressed by Hanuma, creatures living in the caves of that
mountain shrieked in horrifying tones.</p>

<p class=tat>That loud noise from creatures which emanated
because of stress caused to the <span class=GramE>mountain,</span> filled the
earth and all four directions and forests near that mountain. 
Great
snakes with clear swastika signs on their <span class=GramE>hoods,</span>
spewed out frightening flames with their great heads and bit the rocks with
their teeth.</p>

<p class=tat>Then those great rocks bit by those snakes
with anger and venom, burned due to the flame and split into thousand pieces. <a
name=Verse21></a>Medicinal herbs from that mountain, although capable of
destroying ordinary poisons, could not neutralize the poison from those snakes.



Ascetics residing
on that mountain flew away from there thinking that some demons were destroying
it. 
<span class=GramE>Vidhyadharas</span></span> who lived
there, became afraid and flew away with their women folk, leaving behind them
golden jugs of wine in the liquor house, gold vases, a varieties of sauces that
can be licked, eatables, various meats, skins of oxen and swords with golden
hilts.</p>

<p class=tat>The intoxicated 
Vidyadharas</span>
with garlands around their neck decked with red flower garlands and smeared
with sandal paste, with reddened eyes, and with lotus shaped eyes, obtained the
sky. 

Vidyadhara</span> women wearing
necklaces, anklets, armlets and bangles stood in the sky with surprise and with
smiles along with their loved ones.</p>

<p class=tat>
Vidyadharas</span> and
great sages stood in the sky in a group, showing their great prowess and viewed
the mountain. 
Then they heard words of 
Charanas</span>,

Siddhas</span> and pure hearted 
Rishis</span>
who were located in that clear sky. 
&quot;This Hanuma, who
is equal to a mountain, who is the son of 
Vayu</span>, and
who has great speed, wants to cross the ocean which is abode to crocodiles.<a
name=Verse30></a> Hanuma has decided to perform an impossible task for the sake
of Rama and 
Vanaras</span> and wants to obtain the other
side of ocean which is hard to obtain.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>
Vidyadharas</span> thus
listened to the words of those great people and looked at the incomparable
Hanuma, best among 
Vanaras</span>, standing on the mountain.

He, who is equal to a mountain, shook his hair, quivered
his body and let out a great roar like from a vast cloud.</p>

<p class=tat>About to fly, Hanuma jolted his tail, which
was rolled into a circle from top to bottom, and which was covered with hair,
just as 
Garuda</span>, the king of birds would jolt a snake.

Receiving his vigor, the tail curled at his back was seen
like a great serpent being stolen by 
Garuda</span>. <a
name=Verse35></a>Hanuma firmly supported his arms (on the mountain surface)
which resembled huge iron clubs, <span class=GramE>crouched</span> the waist
and contracted his feet.</p>

<p class=tat>Bending shoulders and neck, that mighty and
glorious Hanuma, increased his energy, strength and courage. 
With
his eyes raised up, seeing the way from a distance, viewing the sky, he held
his breath in his heart. 
That mighty Hanuma, equal to an
elephant among monkeys and the best among 
Vaanaraas</span>,
stood firmly with his legs, bent his ears and before flying spoke these words
to the 
Vaanaraas</span>.</p>

<p class=tat>

<a
name=Verse42></a>&quot;I will go to the city of <st1:City><st1:place>Lanka</st1:place></st1:City>,
ruled by Ravana just like an arrow released by Rama will go, with wind-like
speed. If I do not see the daughter of 
Janaka</span> there,
I will go with the same speed to the abode of gods. If I do not see Seetha
there in heaven, I will get Ravana the king of 
raakshasaas</span>
tied up in chains without any effort. I will, in all events, return
successfully along with Seetha or I will get Lanka along with Ravana after
uprooting it.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>
The best among 
Vaanaraas</span>, Hanuma, spoke in this way to 
Vaanaraas</span>
and then without thinking about anything else, flew up with lot of vigor. That great
monkey also thought himself equal to 
Garuda</span>, the king
of birds. 
While he was flying up, due to that force, all
trees on that mountain flew away in all directions, drawing together all their
branches.</p>

<p class=tat>While flying in the sky, he took along with
him, because of the force of his thighs, trees shining with flowers and with
fattened lapwing birds. 
The trees thus being held aloft by
the speed of 
Hanuma's</span> <span class=GramE>thighs,</span>
followed him for a while just as relatives would follow their loved ones
embarking on a long journey.</p>

<p class=tat>Uprooted by the force of 
Hanuma's</span>
thighs, Sal and other excellent trees followed Hanuma like soldiers following
their king. 
Hanuma the great monkey presented a wonderful
sight, with his mountain-like appearance together with the well flowered trees.</p>

<p class=tat>After that, powerful trees sank into the salt
ocean like mountains sinking into ocean due to fear of 
Mahendra</span>.

That Hanuma who was equal to a cloud, covered with flowers
of various kinds, shoots and buds, shone like a mountain with fireflies. <a
name=Verse52></a>Those trees which were released by 
Hanuma's</span>
<span class=GramE>speed,</span> dropped flowers and fell down in the water like
friends going back after bidding farewell to their dear one. 
Set
in motion by the wind from the movement of Hanuma, that variety of blossom,
with various hues, from the trees fell down into the sea. That great ocean
shone like the sky filled with stars.</p>

<p class=tat>Hanuma shone like a cloud in the sky decorated
by lightening, with flowers of various hues sticking to his body. <a
name=Verse55></a>That sea water looked like the sky with delightful stars rising
up, with flowers flown up by 
Hanuma's</span> speed. <a
name=Verse56></a>That sky-borne 
Hanuma's</span> arms which
were spread <span class=GramE>out,</span> were seen like five-headed serpents
coming out of a mountain's peak.</p>

<p class=tat>That great monkey shone like one who is
drinking the great sea together with its waves. He also seemed like one who
desires to drink the whole of sky. 
The eyes of that Hanuma,
who was following the path of sky, which had <span class=GramE>a brilliance</span>
equal to that of lightening, were shining like two fires on a mountain.</p>

<p class=tat>The round, wide, reddish brown eyes of Hanuma,
the best among the monkeys shone like fully risen sun and moon. <a
name=Verse60></a>The ruddy face of Hanuma, with His reddish face shone like the
Sun touched by twilight. 
The tail of Hanuma, the son of 
Vayu</span> floating in the sky, being risen up looked like the
pillar erected in 
honour</span> of Indra.</p>

<p class=tat>The great intellectual Hanuma, with his great
body, and with white teeth, shone like the Sun, being surrounded by his
circular tail. 
That great monkey Hanuma, with his red
colored buttocks, shone like a mountain with a large deposit of red 
Gairika</span> herb broken into pieces.</p>

<p class=tat>Air passing through the lion among monkeys 
Hanuma's</span> arm pits sounded like a thundering cloud. <a
name=Verse65></a>The best among monkeys Hanuma flying thus in the sky, looked
like a meteor darting away with great speed in the sky from northern direction.

With a fast pace equaling that of Sun god, the tall Hanuma
shone like an elephant which increases its size when being festered by a rope.</p>

<p class=tat>Then Hanuma who was flying above the ocean
with his body above the ocean and his shadow being immersed in the sea below,
looked like a boat being driven by wind. 
Whatever place
Hanuma went towards on the ocean, that place became agitated due to the force
of thighs.</p>

<p class=tat>That great monkey with great speed flew in the
sky striking with his chest series of waves which had a great body like that of
mountains. 
Wind from the mighty Hanuma and the wind
released from the clouds caused the ocean with a fearful sound to shake a lot.</p>

<p class=tat>Hanuma flew in the sky dragging along with him
big waves from the ocean as though he were sprinkling them in the sky. <a
name=Verse72></a>Hanuma with great speed crossed waves which were equal to <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Mount</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName>
Meru</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Mount</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName>
<span class=GramE>Mandara</span></span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span
class=GramE>, that</span> had risen up in the sea, as if counting them.</p>

<p class=tat>Then the water together with clouds which was
driven up by the force of Hanuma, shone like a stretched autumnal cloud in the
sky. 
Then various whales, fishes, turtles and crocodiles
were being seen clearly in the sea just as bodies of humans would be seen when
clothes are removed.</p>

<p class=tat>Serpents living in the sea saw Hanuma flying
in the sky and thought that it was 
Garuda</span>, the king
of birds. 

Hanuma's</span> shadow which
was ten 
yojanas</span> wide and thirty 
yojanas</span>
long appeared very beautiful on water.</p>

<p class=tild align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:37.5pt'><span
class=GramE>Comment :</span> &quot;
Yojana</span>&quot; is a
measure of length in ancient <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>
like the modern mile. However its value does not seem to be a standard even
within <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Some consider it as six miles, some as eight miles and some as two and half
miles. Hence it is difficult to have an accurate conversion from 
yojanas</span> to miles.</p>

<p class=tat>That shadow which was following Hanuma and
spread on the ocean, shone like a series of dense white clouds. <a
name=Verse78></a>That great monkey Hanuma, the great resplendent one with a
huge body, shone like a mountain with wings flying in the sky without any
support underneath. 
In whatever path Hanuma the mighty one
went, in that path, there immediately appeared a trough in the ocean below.</p>

<p class=tat>Hanuma while coursing through the path of
birds like the king of birds 
<span class=GramE>Garuda</span></span><span
class=GramE>,</span> dragged with him series of clouds like the god of wind. <a
name=Verse81></a>Great clouds with white, red, blue and madder colors shone on
being dragged by Hanuma.</p>

<p class=tat>Hanuma who is repeatedly entering and leaving
series of clouds as He flies in the sky, is being seen like the moon who shines
and is hidden alternately. 
Then, on seeing Hanuma flying
quickly in the sky, 
Devas</span>, 
Gandharvas</span>
and 
Danavas</span> showered flowers on him.</p>

<p class=tat>Then, the Sun did not scorch Hanuma, the best
among 
Vanaras</span>, who was flying for Rama's welfare. The
wind god 
Vayu</span> also served him with a delightful
breeze. 
Sages praised the great resplendent Hanuma flying
in the sky. 
Devas</span> and 
Gandharvas</span>
also sang in His praise. 
Immediately on seeing the best
among monkeys, Hanuma, flying without any effort, 
Nagas</span>,

Yakshas</span>, 
Rakshasas</span>, 
Devas</span> and birds all praised Him.</p>

<p class=tat>While that best among 
vanaras</span>,
Hanuma, was flying, the god of ocean thought thus for the respect of 
Ikshvaaku</span> dynasty: 
&quot;If I do not
help this best among 
vanaras</span> Hanuma, I shall become
prone to all kinds of ill-talk by those who want to speak against me. <a
name=Verse89></a>I was developed by 
Sagara</span> of 
Ikshvaaku</span> dynasty. This Hanuma who is helping a descendant
of that dynasty should not become tired. 
I have to behave
in such a way that Hanuma would take rest. After resting in me for a while, He
can cross the remaining distance with comfort.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>
Samudra</span> thus making
a good <span class=GramE>thought,</span> spoke to 
Mainaka</span>,
the best among mountains with gold in the middle hidden in water. <a
name=Verse92></a>&quot;O best among mountains 
Mainaka</span>!
You have been positioned here by 
Devendra</span> as an
obstacle to the groups of 
asuras</span> living in 
paataala</span>. 
You are standing at the
entrance of 
paataala</span> which is difficult to measure,
fully covering it, when 
asuras</span> courageous by birth
are trying to rise up again. 
O mountain, you have
capability to grow wide, up or down. O best among mountains, for that reason I
am encouraging you. <span class=GramE>Raise</span> up. 
Hanuma,
the best among monkeys, the courageous one, who has taken up a fearful task for
the benefit of Rama, that such Hanuma while flying in the sky is coming over
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;To this Hanuma, who is a follower of the

Ikshvaaku</span> dynasty, help should be done by me now.
Descendants of 
Ikshvaaku</span> are 
repectable</span>
to me. They are even more respectable to you. 
Do help to
us. Our task may not be miscarried. A task which needs to be performed and not <span
class=GramE>done,</span> will increase the anger of good people. <a
name=Verse98></a><span class=GramE>Raise</span> up above from the water. This
Hanuma is the best among fliers and is a guest to be worshipped for us. Let him
stand on you.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;O mountain with golden hued middle area
and one who is served by 
Devas</span> and 
Gandharvas</span>! Hanuma can take rest on you and then traverse
rest of the distance. 
You are fit to <span class=GramE>raise</span>
up after seeing the gentleness of Sri Rama, and the exile of Seetha, and the
effort of Hanuma.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>The mountain with gold in the middle, 
Mainaka</span>, listening to the words of the salty ocean, got up
quickly from the water, together with great trees and creepers. <a
name=Verse102></a>Then that 
Mainaka</span> became in the
risen state, passing through the ocean water, just like the Sun piercing
through a cloud with His shining rays.</p>

<p class=tat>
That great 
Mainaka</span> who was covered by water in all directions, who had
peaks with 
Kinnaras</span> and great serpents, which were
equal to a sun rise, which were touching the sky, and which had a golden hue,
being ordered by the ocean, showed his peaks in an instant. 
The
sky which had a bluish tinge like that of a <span class=GramE>sword,</span>
shone with a golden hue because of the peaks of the mountain which rose up and
which was like molten gold.
 That best among mountains
became equal to a hundred suns with its peaks which had a golden hue and which
were shining with a self generated shine.</p>

<p class=tat>Hanuma on seeing the mountain which stood
before Him, rising up from the middle of the salty ocean suddenly, decided that
it as an obstacle. 
That great monkey Hanuma with a great <span
class=GramE>speed,</span> brought that great tall mountain with His chest just
as the God of wind would a cloud. 
That best among
mountains 
Mainaka</span>, thus being fell down by that
Hanuma, recognized 
Hanuma's</span> speed and lauded him with
pleasure.</p>

<p class=tat>
<st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Mount</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName>
Mainaka</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
with love and with gladdened heart obtained a human form and standing on its
own peak, spoke these words approaching that courageous Hanuma in the sky. <a
name=Verse112></a>&quot;O the great 
Vanara</span>! You have
performed this impossible task of flying over the ocean. Do come down on to my
peaks and rest for a while to your comfort. 
The ocean was
developed by people born in Sri Rama's dynasty. That such ocean is worshipping
in lieu of Sri Rama, you who is desirous of Sri Rama's welfare.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;When a service is done, a return
service needs to be rendered. This is an ancient tradition. Such this <span
class=GramE>ocean</span> who wants to do a return service to the 
Raghu</span> dynasty, is suitable for respect by you. <a
name=Verse115></a>
&quot;After flying a hundred 
yojanas</span>, let this Hanuma rest on your peak and then travel
the rest of distance.&quot; - Thus I have been encouraged by this ocean for
your sake due to His great respect for you. O best among 
vanaras</span>!
Stop for a while and then go after resting on me.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;O best among 
vanaras</span>!
For that reason, here <span class=GramE>is</span> lots of roots, fruits and
other eatables which are fragrant and sweet. May you leave after eating that
and resting here for a <span class=GramE>while.</span>
 O
chief among 
vanaras</span>! Besides this, there also exists a
relationship which is famous in all the three worlds, which is based on great
virtues, for us with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;O son of 
Vayu</span>,
the god of wind! O best among 
vanaras</span>! I am thinking
you as being very important among those 
vanaras</span> who
are fast and who are capable of flying. 
By a person who
wants to know dharma or by one who knows dharma, a guest even though ordinary
is to be respected. What else can I say in the case of a great guest like <span
class=GramE>you.</span> 
O best among 
vanaras</span>!
You are the son of the great 
Vayu</span> - the God of wind,
who is best in speed among the 
Devas</span>. In speed you
are equal to him alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;O knower of Dharma! If you are
worshipped, 
Vayu</span> also gets worship. For that reason
you are to be worshipped by me. Also listen to another reason in this matter. <a
name=Verse123></a>O son! Earlier in the 
Krita</span> 
<span class=GramE>yuga</span></span>, mountains had wings. With
speed equal to that of 
Garuda</span> and 
Vayu</span>,
they went in all directions. 
After that when those
mountains were thus flying freely, 
Devas</span> and living
creatures together with sages obtained fear in the doubt that those mountains
might fall down.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;Then the angry 
Devendra</span>
who performed a hundred 
Asvamedha</span> rituals, cut off
the wings of thousands of mountains by his weapon 
vajra</span>
then and there. 
That 
Devendra</span>
angrily reached me with raised 
vajra</span>. Then I was
thrown away immediately by the great 
Vayu</span>. <a
name=Verse127></a>O best among 
vanaras</span>! With saved
full wings, being thrown down into this salt ocean, I have been protected by
your father.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;O chief among 
vanaras</span>!

Vayu</span> is thus indeed respectable to me. For that
reason I am respecting you. <span class=GramE>My this</span> relationship with
you has great virtues. 
O great 
Vanara</span>!
Because this matter is like this, you are suitable to make myself and 
Sagara</span> happy, with a gladdened heart. 
O
best among 
Vanaras</span>! Reduce your fatigue. Accept our
worship also. Respect our love. I am happy by your manifestation.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>Hanuma listening to the best mountain's
words, spoke <span class=GramE>thus :</span> &quot;I am happy. Hospitality has
been done. Let this ill feeling be removed. 
The time to
perform my duty is hastening me. The day too is passing. A promise has also been
given by me. I should not stand here in the middle neglecting my duty.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>The courageous Hanuma saying thus, touched
the mountain with His hand, entered the sky and flew on with a smile. <a
name=Verse134></a>That Hanuma was thus seen with great respect by the ocean and
the mountain, and also worshipped with suitable blessings. 
After
that leaving the mountain and the great ocean, and flying up far into the clear
sky, Hanuma followed the path of his father.</p>

<p class=tat>The son of 
Vayu</span>
obtained the speed to fly still higher into the sky and seeing that mountain
below, went in the clear sky which had no support. 
Seeing
Hanuma perform that very difficult second task (first one being the flight over
ocean), all 
Devas</span>, 
Siddhas</span>
and great sages praised Him.</p>

<p class=tat>
Devas</span> and the
thousand eyed 
Devendra</span> who were there, became happy
by the task of that golden hued 
Mainaka</span>. <a
name=Verse139></a>The wise 
Devendra</span> himself spoke
these words through faltering tones due to extreme happiness, to 
Mainaka</span>, the best among mountains. 
&quot;O

Mainaka</span>, the king of mountains! I am very happy with
you. O gentle one! I am giving protection to you. Proceed according to your
comfort.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>To the dauntless Hanuma crossing hundred 
yojanas</span>, who is fearless even when there is reason to be
afraid, a great help has been done by you. 
This 
Vanara</span> Hanuma is going for the benefit of Sri Rama, the son
of Dasaratha. I am very happy with you who <span class=GramE>is</span> doing
respect to Him.</p>

<p class=tat>Thereafter, the best among mountains obtained
great happiness on seeing 
Devendra</span>, the lord of 
Devas</span> being happy. 
Then that mountain
with a given boon from 
Devendra</span> stood still there.
Hanuma also leaped over that part of the ocean in an instant.</p>

<p class=tat>Thereafter, 
Devas</span>
together with 
Gandharvas</span>, 
Siddhas</span>
and great sages spoke thus to 
Surasa</span>, the mother of 
Nagas</span>, equal to the Sun in brilliance. 
<a
name=Verse147></a>&quot;This glorious son of 
Vayu</span>,
going by the name of Hanuma is flying over the ocean. You obtain a horrible
mountain like demonic appearance and make a face with fearful tusks, red-brown
eyes and as vast as the sky, and create an obstacle to Him for an instant. <a
name=Verse148></a>We <span class=GramE>are desiring</span> to find out if by
His strength and also courage and intelligence He can win over you or obtain
sorrow.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>
That Goddess 
Surasa</span>, thus spoken to by 
Devas</span>
and also being respected by them, wearing a horrible disfigured appearance of a
demon in the middle of the ocean which caused fear to all, and stopping Hanuma
who was flying, spoke these words. 
&quot;O best among 
Vanaras</span>! You have been given by 
Devas</span>
as my food. I will eat you. Enter inside my mouth.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>Thus spoken to by 
Surasa</span>,
the glorious Hanuma, with a happy face and with folded hands, spoke these words
to 
Surasa</span>. 
&quot;The son of
Dasaratha, with the name of Rama entered the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>forest</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>
Dandaka</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
together with His brother Lakshmana and wife Seetha. 
When
that Sri Rama, with a bitter enmity towards 
Rakshasas</span>,
was diverted in another task, His famed wife Seetha had been taken away by
Ravana. 
I am going for Rama's sake as a messenger to find <span
class=GramE>Her</span> presence. O subject of Sri Rama! You are suited to help
Rama. 
Otherwise after seeing Seetha and informing that to
Sri Rama who makes Seetha without troubles, I will obtain your mouth. I am
promising truthfully to you.&#8221;</p>

Thus
being spoken to by Hanuma, 
Surasa</span> with power to take
desired form, spoke thus: &quot;No one can overcome me. This is my boon.&quot;<a
name=Verse158></a> Mother of 
Nagas</span>, 
Surasa</span>, desiring to know the strength of Hanuma, spoke
these words on seeing Him going away.</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;O best among 
Vanaras</span>!
You are bound to go only after entering my mouth. This boon had been given to
me long ago by Brahma.&quot; - speaking thus, with quickness she opened her
wide mouth and stood before Hanuma. 
Then Hanuma speaking
thus to 
Surasa</span>, became angry and became ten 
yojanas</span> long and ten 
yojanas</span>
wide.</p>

<p class=tat>Seeing Hanuma, who looked like a cloud, being
ten 
yojanas</span> long, 
Surasa</span>
also made her mouth twenty 
yojanas</span> long. <a
name=Verse162></a>Thereafter, Hanuma got angry and became thirty 
yojanas</span> long. 
Surasa</span> made her
mouth forty 
yojanas</span> high. The courageous Hanuma then
became fifty 
yojanas</span> high. 
<a
name=Verse164></a>Thereafter, Hanuma got angry and became thirty 
yojanas</span> long. 
Surasa</span> made her
mouth forty 
yojanas</span> high. The courageous Hanuma then
became fifty 
yojanas</span> high.</p>

<p class=tat>
Surasa</span> then made
her mouth sixty 
yojanas</span> long. The mighty Hanuma in
the same <span class=GramE>fashion,</span> became seventy 
yojanas</span>
high. 

Surasa</span> made her mouth
eighty 
yojanas</span> high. The mountain-like Hanuma then
became ninety 
yojanas</span> high. 
<span
class=GramE>The great wise Hanuma seeing that mouth with a long tongue which
was horrible and equal to hell being opened by 
Surasa</span>,
greatly reduced His own body and became the size of a thumb.</span></p>

<p class=tat>The glorious Hanuma with great <span
class=GramE>speed,</span> quickly entered 
Surasa's</span>
mouth and came out of it and standing in the sky spoke these words to 
Surasa</span>. 
&quot;O daughter of 
Daksha</span>! I indeed entered your mouth. <span class=GramE>My
regards to you.</span> I will now go where Seetha is. Your boon also came
true.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat><span class=GramE>Seeing that 
Vanara</span> being released from her mouth like the moon from the
mouth of 
Rahu</span>, goddess 
Surasa</span>
spoke these words assuming her normal form.</span> 
&quot;O
gentle Hanuma! Go according to your comfort to achieve the desired task. Bring
Seetha together with the great Sri Rama.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>Seeing that third very difficult task of
Hanuma, all the creatures then praised Hanuma saying &quot;Good! Good!<span
class=GramE>&quot;.</span> 
That Hanuma, equal to 
Garuda</span> in speed, neared the ocean which is the abode of 
<span class=GramE>Varuna</span></span><span class=GramE>,</span>
entered the sky and went in His original path.</p>

<p class=tat>

<a
name=Verse177></a>


Hanuma
went, like 
Garuda</span>, in the sky served by clouds (or
streams of water), served also by birds, tread by masters of music 
Tumbura</span> and other 
Gandharvas</span>,
served by 
Airavata</span>, borne by lions, elephants,
tigers, birds and serpents, decorated by clear 
Vimanas</span>
moving with great speed, shone by fires with thunderous jolt equal to that of 
Vajra</span> - the weapon of 
Devendra</span>,
decorated by people with good deeds, people with great luck who conquered the
heavens, served by the God of fire carrying great quantities of oblations,
shone by planets, stars, moon, sun and starlets, occupied by groups of great
sages, 
Gandharvas</span>, 
Nagas</span>, 
Yakshas</span> but unpopulated by humans, clear and all pervasive,
served by the 
gandharva</span> king 
Vishvaavasu</span>,
roamed by elephants of 
Devendra</span>, the path of the moon
and the sun, the auspicious one, a wide canopy of the earth constructed by
Brahma, served in various ways by excellent courageous groups of 
Vidyadharas</span>.</p>

<p class=tat>Hanuma, the son of 
Vayu</span>,
visible everywhere, obtained the sky without support, like the king of birds
with long wings. 
A 
demoness</span> by
the name of 
Simhika</span> with the power to assume desired
form, saw Hanuma flying, increased in size and thought thus in her mind.<a
name=Verse183></a> &quot;After a long time, this great animal came into my
grasp. After long time, today I will enjoy my meal.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>Thinking thus in her mind, 
Simhika</span> attracted His shadow. While the shadow was thus
being grasped, Hanuma thought thus. 
&quot;Like a great
boat in the ocean with opposing winds, I am being pulled back forcefully, with
disabled power.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>After that, Hanuma looking sideways, upwards
and downwards, saw a big animal raised up in the salty ocean. 
Hanuma
saw that animal with a horrible face and thought: &quot;This animal with a
strange appearance, with great strength attracting shadow, is indeed the animal
that had been told by 
Sugriva</span>. There is no doubt in
that.&quot; 
That wise Hanuma recognizing that animal
correctly as 
<span class=GramE>Simhika</span></span><span
class=GramE>,</span> increased His body greatly, like a cloud in rainy season.</p>

<p class=tat>That 
Simhika</span> seeing
the growing body of the great monkey <span class=GramE>Hanuma,</span> spread
her mouth to be equal to the middle of 
Patala</span>. <a
name=Verse190></a>
Roaring like a dense cloud, she ran
towards the 
Vanara</span>. Then the wise Hanuma saw her
opened very big mouth equal to His own body and also her internal organs. <a
name=Verse192></a>That Hanuma with great strength and with a body equal to a <span
class=GramE>diamond,</span> repeatedly contracted His body and fell into her
opened mouth.</p>

<p class=tat>
Siddhas</span> and 
Charanas</span> saw Hanuma sinking in her mouth, like the full
moon on a full moon day being swallowed by 
Rahu</span>. <a
name=Verse194></a>Then Hanuma rend her internal organs with His sharp nails and
after that flew up with a speed equal to that of thought.</p>

<p class=tat>That wise Hanuma felling 
Simhika</span>
down with His vision, courage and ability, developed again by speed. <a
name=Verse196></a>That 
Simhika</span> with heart rend by
Hanuma fell in water with sorrow. Seeing 
Simhika</span>
killed by Hanuma, creatures roaming in the sky spoke thus to that best among 
Vanaras</span>. 
&quot;O best among 
Vanaras</span>! A huge animal has been killed by you. A great task
has been done. Perform the task dear to you auspiciously. 
O
best among 
Vanaras</span>! Whoever has the four qualities of
courage, vision, intellect and skill, all these four virtues like you, such a
person will not fail in any task.&quot;</p>

<p class=tat>That Hanuma the respectable one, thus
respected by them, entered the sky and went like the 
Garuda</span>
with a determined goal. 
Hanuma after almost reaching the
other <span class=GramE>shore,</span> looked in all directions and saw a series
of trees at the end of his journey of hundred 
yojanas</span>.</p>

<p class=tat>The best among 
Vanaras</span>,
Hanuma, immediately after getting down also saw an island decorated by a
variety of trees and also the forests in the region of <st1:place>Malaya</st1:place>.


That Hanuma with controlled senses and
with good thoughts looked at the ocean, the bay and the trees born in the bay,
and also the faces of the wives of the ocean (rivers are considered wives of
ocean), observed Himself to be equal in size to a great cloud as though
stopping the sky, and thought thus.</p>

<p class=tild align=left style='text-align:left;text-indent:37.5pt'><span
class=GramE>Comment :</span> It is considered an auspicious sign to be welcomed
by married women. Hanuma seeing the wives of 
Sagara</span>
coming to meet their husband thus bodes well for Hanuma.</p>

<p class=tat>&quot;After seeing my huge body and the
speed, 
Rakshasas</span> will become curious.&quot; - <span
class=GramE>thus</span> thought the great Hanuma.</p>

<p class=tat>For that reason, Hanuma reduced His
mountain-like body and obtained the nature of one who reached self-realization,
free from infatuations. 
Hanuma greatly reducing His size
became normal in nature regaining His original form, like Vishnu who mitigated
the strength of <st1:place>Bali</st1:place> by taking three strides.</p>

<p class=tat>Hanuma capable of assuming many different
beautiful forms, <span class=GramE>who</span> cannot be defeated by enemies,
obtained the other side of ocean and being cognizant of Himself restored His
own form and became with a decided mission. 
After that
great one who looked like a huge mass of clouds, alighted on the mountain <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>peak</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName>
Lamba</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
with wonderful lower peaks, abundant with various things and filled with 
Ketaka</span>, 
Uddalaka</span> and coconut
trees.</p>

<p class=tat>After that Hanuma for His part obtained the
ocean shore, observed the city of <st1:City><st1:place>Lanka</st1:place></st1:City>
from the top of the mountain, leaving His original form, tormenting animals and
birds, alighted on that mountain. 
Having traversed, by the
dint of his strength over the ocean which was infested with demons and reptiles
and endowed with series of huge waves, and alighting on the shore of the great
sea, Hanuma then saw the City of <st1:City><st1:place>Lanka</st1:place></st1:City>
having a resemblance of 
Amaravati</span>, the capital City
of <st1:City><st1:place>Indra</st1:place></st1:City>.</p>

<p class=verloc style='text-indent:25.0pt'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=tat>Thus, this is the 1st chapter in 
Sundara</span>
Kanda of 
Valmiki</span> Ramayana, the First Epic poem of <st1:country-region><st1:place>India</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
