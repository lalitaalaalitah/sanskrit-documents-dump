<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy Monkeys</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 24<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Sugreeva and Tara lament Vali&#39;s death. Sugreeva seeks permission of Rama to enter the funeral pyre of 
his brother Vali to self-immolate himself for his wrongdoing in getting his own brother killed. Tara 
asks Rama to kill her with the same arrow with which Vali is killed, so that she too can go to heavens 
to meet her husband.</p>

<p class="tat">
A word about this chapter. The bardic tradition is in the habit of including everything, while the critical 
editions exclude anything arbitrary. This chapter is excluded in the critical editions, but traditional 
versions retained it, and all publications publish this. The scholars have also said that all the forty-four 
verses in here have no stamp of Valmiki, the verbiage and verbosity are heightened, even the meter is 
overfilled, and even the word positioning does not yield proper meaning. Even so, all are retained in 
all publications. However, it may be mentioned that if some Valmiki Jr. written and included this chapter, 
it should have been ages before, but not in the known ages, because Dharmaakuutam, Govindaraja and others 
have commentaries on chapter. In all the commentaries an exhaustive commentary is there on two verses 
uttered by Tara, which is included here also.</p>

confront any hopping of any monkey at him, with indignation for killing Vali.</p>

<p class="comment">
Mythical parable: Once Brihaspati, the Jupiter and the Divine Counsellor of Indra was irritated at Indra 
and went in hiding for some days. Then gods have fetched one named Vishvarupa, a son of TvaSTa, where 
TvaSTa himself is Brahma&#39;s brainchild, and made Vishvaruupa to sit on the high seat of Brihaspati. This 
Vishvarupa becoming partial to demons used to give portions of ritual oblations to demons. Knowing this 
Indra kills Vishvarupa, and thus gets attached to sin called <em>brahma paataka paapa</em>, sin for 
slaying a Brahman.</p>

<p class="comment">
Myth: Indra seeks the help of earth, trees, waters and women to get rid of the sin of Brahman-slaying 
when he killed Vishvarupa, the son of TvaSTa. These four in turn barter with Indra for some boons to 
them. Earth wanted automatic refill of dugout portions, trees wanted regrowth of cut branches, waters 
wanted an all purifying effect, and women wanted to have never decreasing sexual desire. When Indra 
agreed to these conditions, then the earth has taken a part of Indra&#39;s sin by which it acquired sinful 
wastelands, waters got froth, trees exudation, and women menstruation. This is as detailed in <em>bhaagavata 
puraNa </em>, sixth canto.</p>

shuddha sattva</em>, the other two human traits, namely anger and stupidity <em>rajo tamo guNaaH</em>, 
have quietened in her and she became very polite and started to eulogise him. When she advised Vali 
to not to confront this Rama, then also she spoke about the attributes of Rama, but it is on hearsay 
information. Now to be in his presence, she is rendered as a pure consciousness. Other mms ascribe
<em>vishuddha sattvaa</em> to Tara, as Rama&#39;s pure being is already known to all. The nearness of a

There are voluminous commentaries on this and next verse of Tara, of which some excerpts from Govindaraja

<p class="comment"><em>tvam</em> &#39;you... of whom I am about to 
give a positive picture, though presently contrary to that is your aspect and action...&#39;
<em>aprameyaH ca</em> &#39;indeterminate is your aspect...&#39; &#39;Veda-s themselves have 
no consolidation of your aspect when said as, <em>vedaahametam purusam mahaantam</em> 
&#39;Supreme Person is endless in nature...&#39; and as <em>ka itthaa vedaa</em> &#39;who knows 
that the being is like this or that...&#39; and further <em>shvetashvataropanishad</em> 
at 4-19 and also <em>mahaa naaraayaNa upanishad</em> at I-10 say:</p>

<p class="ItrSloka">
na enam uurthvam na tirya~ncam na madhya parijagrabhat |<br>na tasya pratimaa asti yasya naama mahad 
yashaH ||</p>

<p class="comment">&quot;None has ever grasped Him by his upward limit, or His middle 
portion, or His limit across... His name is &#39;great glory&#39; for nothing limits His nature by definition...&quot;</p>

<p class="comment">Veda-s also said that he does not know of himself
<em>so anga veda yadi vaa na veda. </em>But Rama is evident before her eyes. That 
is not the reality of that being, so disputes Tara. This present aspect is only a namesake. While we 
worship the unknown we conceive a picture or statue to our contemplation but not for his benefit.
<em>upaasakaanaam kaaryaartham brahmaNo ruupa kalpanaa</em> &#39;he does not need any 
benefits from us should we be benevolent.&#39; The singular <em>tvam</em> &#39;you...&#39; implies 
his singularity. &#39;You are without any other divine paraphernalia and yet you can manage the entire universe, 
singularly... but presently you appear to be manlike, with arrows and a bow... may be you are hiding 
your divine disc and conch shell etc., thus we are unable to elicit whether you are &#39;that&#39; or &#39;this&#39; 
being with our limited physical faculties.&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">Though we are unable to know you by our physical faculties, can 
we know by our mental faculties? Even that is impossible for us, because you are
<em>duraasadaH</em> &#39; an inaccessible entity...&#39; <em>dur aa sada</em> 
the root <em>sad - Sa d`al`</em> after two preverbs <em>dur, aa</em> 
, has three meanings <em>Sa d`al` visharaNa gati avasaaneSu</em> 1]
<em>visharaNa= jiirNatvam, shidhilatvam</em> perish, pine away; 2]
<em>gati= gamana</em> dynamism. For this Monier William&#39;s lexicon has no equalling 
word, but recorded in there is the word, &#39;watch, wait for&#39; an act in the nature of dynamism; 3]
<em>avasaadana</em> ruin, distress, depression. Then she said this way, &#39;because 
you are eternal there is no perish, because you are ever dynamic no impasse can occur, because you are 
ever blissful no depression can occur, either to you or to your administration of dharma...&#39; This is 
what is told in Bhagavad-Gita at 11-53: <em>na aham vedaiH na tapasaa na daanena na 
ca ijyayaa | shakya evam vidho draSTum...</em> &#39;not through Veda-s, not through charities, not through 
rituals I can be discerned...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">She further analyses: &#39;Because you are such an inaccessible being, 
but we are all accessible to you, can you excite yourself to grab this kingdom or the females or riches 
in it? You cannot do so, because you are <em>jitendriyaH</em> &#39;one with his senses 
conquered...&#39; You will give away all this to Sugreeva. You are said to be not eyeing at other&#39;s wives.
<em>na raamaH para daaran vai cakshubhyaam api pashyate</em> then how you eye at 
us? You cannot.&#39; This goes with the saying of <em>shveta ashvatara upanishad, 3-19: 
apaaNi paado javano grahiitaa pashyatya cakshuH na shR^iNoti karnaH</em> &#39;no hands no legs, He goes 
everywhere, no ears no eyes He sees everything...&#39; Thus the sensory organs and their activities are 
for the mortals, immortal is beyond them. Thus you have conquered all such physicality.&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">&#39;I thought you to be an unrighteous person in killing my husband, 
but you are <em>uttama dhaarmikaH</em> supreme among the righteous souls, because 
you have helped Sugreeva without any personal greed...&#39; A person who undertakes and does a deed only 
for himself is a base-level righteous person. One, who does so for his benefit, and for the benefit 
of a few others, is a middle-level righteous one. And a highest level righteous one undertakes anything 
to protect righteousness alone. In killing Vali, Rama has got only one point in view, &#39;to eliminate 
an abuser of tradition, <em>caaritra duuSaka...</em> and not even bothering for 
the searchers of Seetha. When Rama can eliminate fourteen thousand demons of Khara in Aranya Kanda and 
also when he can put the sea to turmoil, can he not fling his arrow to the other side of that ocean 
to kill Ravana? He can, but he has to course through Sugreeva&#39;s friendship to punish Vali, among other 
things. &#39;So you are supreme among these kinds of benefactors, because you have paved way to Vali to 
go to heavens instead of netherworlds... so no discredit ensues...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">Rama may question as to &#39;why you are eulogising me when I got 
discredit in killing Vali without confronting him?&#39; For this she said <em>a + kshayya 
kiirti</em> &#39;unmitigated is your glory...&#39; &#39;you are renowned not by a few of us but all the Veda-s 
extol you...&#39; This is what is available in Bhagavad-Gita at 15-15 <em>vedaiH ca sarvaiH 
aham eva vedyo</em> &#39;by all Veda-s, I alone can be known...&#39; and the Vedic saying
<em>tasya naama mahad yashaH</em> is also there.</p>

<p class="comment">&#39;You are a very discriminating person because you are...
<em>vicakshiNaH</em> &#39;because you have eliminated only one scandalous Vali but not 
the entire race. You yourself said, &#39;I will eliminate all the demonic race...&#39; when you wanted t punish 
Ravana the abductor of your wife, when you have seen Seetha&#39;s ornaments as at 4-6-25. That analogy is 
not shown here in Kishkindha. When Sugreeva examined your capacity, you also examined the capacities 
of Vali and Sugreeva in their first round of fight. Because Sugreeva prayed for your mercy you simply 
did not kill Vali, but a calculated approach is adopted by you, in the second round, and hence you are 
very discriminating...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">You are <em>kshiti kshamavaan</em> &#39;earth-like, 
in endurance...&#39; and as told by Narada to Valmiki <em>kshamayaa pR^ithvii samaH</em> 
&#39;in perseverance equals with earth...&#39; Bala Kanda 1-1-18. You are tolerant of us, the other monkeys, 
though we were on the side of erring Vali. You have not taken us on en masse because of your tolerance.</p>

<p class="comment">The words like &#39;ca&#39; &#39;tu&#39; &#39;eva&#39; either play a havoc or go in drain 
in their usage. Here &#39;ca&#39; is used for six attributes while two more are not suffixed with it. The usage 
of &#39;ca&#39; to six of the attributes is to tell that those aspects are available in the Supreme alone. The 
last two attributes are not suffixed with this &#39;ca&#39; because these two are Rama&#39;s attributes in his personal 
humanly nature and the Supreme is above these things.</p>

<p class="comment">Leaving all the above to a side for a moment, there is another 
viewpoint for these aspects. The word &#39;<em>ca</em>&#39; if taken as &#39;alone&#39; or &#39;only&#39; <em>aprameyaH 
ca</em> becomes &#39;you are knowable &#39;only&#39; by your adherents [alone,] despisers cannot know you...&#39;
<em>duraasadaH ca</em> becomes &#39;you are inaccessible to others and accessible &#39;only&#39; 
to your adherents [alone...] <em>jitendriyaH ca</em> &#39;indulgent in your adherents 
&#39;only / alone&#39; and by conquering your senses you do not cast your glance at the disavowed...&#39;
<em>uttama dhaarmikaH ca</em> &#39;you are the &#39;only&#39; supreme Dharma, or you alone is 
Supreme Dharma...&#39; <em>vicakshanaH ca</em> &#39;you &#39;only&#39; can discriminate good from 
bad, right from wrong... as you alone have said <em>mitra bhaavena sampraaptam na 
tyajae ayam katham ca na</em> &#39;I will not leave off one who befriends me...&#39; <em>
kshiti kshamavaan ca</em> &#39;the only/alone forbearing being...&#39; Here also the &#39;ca&#39; can be brought in 
as per <em>dehalii diipa nyaaya,</em> the syndrome of &#39;portico-lamp&#39; a lamp kept 
in portico beams a little inside the house. Thus Govindaraja comments on this verse.</p>

<p class="comment">
It is said that Tara is pacified by this single assurance of Rama 
that Angada will not be looked down, or banished, or killed by the forthcoming regime, and she is self-assured 
that Rama effectuates his promise. Not only this but her status of an empress is also protected because 
Sugreeva remarries her. Can a Hindu woman remarry? Yes she can, and should.

<p class="comment">
There are some more rulings besides this. A woman is at liberty 
to remarry under &#39;certain&#39; circumstances. It appears that Tara is given equally to Vali and Sugreeva 
by gods, like Draupadi to Pandava-s. But in such wife-sharing system some strict rules are to be observed 
like time, months, years, turns etc., as has been done by Pandava-s. That was lacking with Vali. Vali&#39;s 
thinking is that Sugreeva wants Tara more than Kishkindha, so Vali did not kill Sugreeva but chased 
him away from Kishkindha, presuming the begrudging of Sugreeva is too trivial. The actual cause of rivalry 
between these two is Tara. But this cannot be over stated. Sugreeva informs Rama while narrating episode 
of Dundubhi, &#39;due to some woman there was a rivalry...&#39; Sugreeva too does not overstate this. This is 
as per Govindaraja commentary.</p>

<p class="comment">
Regarding the chastity of Tara no doubt is to be expressed by 
any for she is a celestial, emerged from the churning of Milky Ocean. She is equated with Seetha, Draupadi, 
Ahalya, and listening their episodes is said to remove any evil-visualisations, as in this verse:</font></p>
