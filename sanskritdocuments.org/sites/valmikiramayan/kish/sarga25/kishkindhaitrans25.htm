<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 25<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
<p class="txt">
Rama hurries up Sugreeva to proceed with the funeral ceremony of Vali instead of sitting around the body and wailing 
endlessly. Rama tersely tells about living being&#39;s dependency on the eternal Time, Fate and the Absolute. Then 
Sugreeva takes charge of the situation and arranges for the monarchical funeral to Vali. At the final departure 
of her husband, Tara again laments. Ultimately Vali&#39;s body is committed to fire for his voyage to heavens on a 
remote avenue.</p>

<p class="comment">
A person comes to life after ten months incarceration in mother&#39;s womb; lives for a hundred year period, but on 
death, dead body is to be removed within ten hours. If a dead body is kept unattended for more than ten hours 
of death, a blemish called paryuSita doSa occurs. Thus, it is said, &#39;The duties ordained according to their time 
value are to be attended on time, otherwise if you lapse that particular time by shedding tears alone, there is 
no merit to the departed soul...&#39; Maheshvara Tiirtha</p>

niyatiH kaaraNam loke niyatiH karma saadhanam |<br>niyatiH sarva bhuutaanaam niyogeShu iha kaaraNam || 4-25-4</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>4. loke</em> = in world; <em>niyatiH</em> = SOP standard operating procedure of universe, Fate, God, Time;

<p class="tat">
&quot;Fate is the cause of all the worlds, Fate is the instrument for action, Fate is the deciding factor for motivation 
of all beings in these worlds. [4-25-4]</p>

<p class="comment">
Here the word <em>niyati</em> has three deflections, <em>svabhaava vaada</em> Nature-theory, <em>niyati vaada</em> 
Fate-theory, <em>kaala vaada</em> Time-theory, and all these culminate into Theism, for theologises. Atheists 
hold the above three in each of its own. <em>svabhaava: kaaraNam vinaa eva sarvam bhavati iti svabhaava vaada...</em> 
&#39;without any apparent reason everything happens on its own, where the question of merit or sin does not arise...&#39; 
and the adherents of karmic-cycle say, <em>niyati: puurva janma aarjita dharma adharmau niyati, sa eva sarvasya 
kaaraNam...</em> &#39;the merit or sin earned or accrued in last births brings forth the fruits of the present and 
future births...&#39; <em>kaala</em> Time, the undisputable time factor is the reason for everything, also called 
&#39;god&#39;.</p>

<p class="comment">
If the attribute of god to the Time is removed and seen only as time with its watches, Rama is said to have spoken 
in the perfect tongue of perfect atheists in these four or five verses given below. However, if there is an All-Supervisory-God, 
these three will culminate in Him and then He becomes the Time, the presiding authority of worlds. For this the
<em>shveta ashvatara upanishad</em>: has this hymn at its 1-2: <em>kaalaH svabhaavo niyatiH yadR^icaa bhuutaani 
yoniH puruSha iti cintyaa |&nbsp; </em>&#39;time, nature, fate, chance, material, power, intellect... thus all these 
are [thought to be the cause, but in vain...] Thus the words used as &#39;Fate&#39; &#39;Time&#39; are alterable with &#39;Supreme 
Being/Person.&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Unlike Bhagavad Gita, which says everything in first person, here Rama is saying that he alone is Supreme, but 
naming Time, Fate etc., instead of using first person and declaring about himself.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;But even the mutations brought forth by Time are observable by a perceiver with a clear vision, and the virtue, 
wealth, pleasures are to be perceived as cumulated during the course of Time. [4-25-8]</p>

<p class="comment">
If it is asked that, &#39;If Time takes care of everything what is it humans have to do, except to live like other 
animals?&#39; For this the above verse says that &#39;a gentle perceiver has to perceive the changes brought in by the 
course of Time and according to them and also taking the help of scriptural dictates, one has to intelligently 
undergo the course of events, without asserting himself of his own achievements or without blaming himself or 
that imposing Time, should the results be distasteful. This is the way to attain the humanly-means, <em>puruSa 
artha</em> -s. And this is the way to live different from animals.</p>

of a true combatant unworried of his life, he acquired heaven. [4-25-10]</p>

<p class="comment">
This is to say Vali has attained a higher heaven than the routine heaven ruled by Indra, where the merit and demerit 
are metered. These higher heavens are impossible abodes for usual seekers of release from karmic cycle, but they 
chance upon certain blessed souls like Vali, who is sent from here to<em> vaikunTha</em> Vishnu&#39;s Milky-Oceanic 
abode, by no less than Rama himself.</p>

[4-25-11]</p>

<p class="comment">
This is choicest course Vali sought after is to die in the course of fighting. For this it is said in Dharmaakuutam:

the word <em>niyati</em> the results of earlier births come to fruition abiding the Time... Time is bound by the 
results of earlier births... as such no independency to Time... thus, bound by the Time cycle, an individual is

<p class="comment">
These few verses describing the royal palanquin are not available in critical edition and even in some ancient 
mms. The word <em>guhaa gahana</em> is not &#39;deep cave&#39; as in ordinary sense. It is one among the rare expressions 
used in Ramayana. <em>guhaa gahana shabdena shibika upari prasaarya maaNaanaam pa~njaram ucyate...</em> &#39;the roof 
of the cabin / cage of the palanquin...&#39; is the meaning of the above words. Tilaka. [After Dr. Satya Vrat.].</p>

<p class="tat">
On giving fire to the pyre procedurally, then Angada with dismayed senses performed circumambulations in an anticlockwise 
direction to his father, who is voyaging on a remote avenue. [4-25-50]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>apa savya</em> means another way, &#39;to keep the sacred thread on the right shoulder...&#39; which will 
be observed only in funeral ceremonies. Usually this sacred thread of Hindus is sling on the left shoulder, which 
is called <em>savyam</em>. In funeral rites it is occasionally changed onto right shoulder. In temples when circumambulations 
are performed, the devotee faces the idol, keeping his right to left of the idol and moves on his left, around 
sanctum sanctorum. This is called <em>savya pradakshiNa</em> and in funerals it is other way round, called <em>
apa savya pradakshiNa</em>.</p>

<p class="comment">
In fact Sugreeva is fully wet with river waters and effusing is water from his clothing and body, yet he is compared 
with flaming blaze, only to say that Sugreeva has washed off the sin called Vali and bathed in the pious waters 
called Rama&#39;s mercy, thus his resplendence is pure and fire-like. Govindaraja. By these observances of funeral 
rites, water oblations etc., the Vanara- may not be regarded as monkeys or as other mammals, but this race is 
to be regarded a divine race adherent to Vedic practises. They took birth at the hest of Brahma.</p>
