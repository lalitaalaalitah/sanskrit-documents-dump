<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Kishkindha Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 45 </h3>

<br><p class="txt">The war cries of monkey soldiers in their enthusiasm to conquer Ravana are uttered
in the audience of Sugreeva, when all of them started to their designated directions. This suggests
the <em>sugriiva aaj~na</em> 'the inviolable order of Sugreeva.'</p>
<br>

<p class="tat"> </p>
<p class="tat">On calling forth all the fly-jumpers for achieving the purpose of Rama's task the
best fly-jumper and the king of monkeys Sugreeva spoke to all of them, "oh, best vanara-s, you
shall search all of this earth as I have detailed." Sugreeva said so to all monkeys. </p>
<p class="tat">Understanding that arduous order of the king of monkeys Sugreeva those best monkeys
started out covering the earth like grasshoppers. Rama remained on that Mt. Prasravana along with
Lakshmana looking forward to that month which is marked for locating Seetha. Then the brave monkey
Shatabali swiftly started towards the beautiful northern quarter that is encompassed by the king of
mountains, namely Himavanta. The monkey-troop commander Vinata journeyed towards the eastern
direction, and the fly-jumper, leader of monkeys and Air-god's son Hanuma travelled towards
southerly quarter that is once trodden by Sage Agastya, along with Lt. Tara, Prince-regent Angada,
and others. The commander of fly-jumpers and a tigerly monkey Sushena started out towards the
horrifying western direction that is ruled by Varuna, the Rain-god. </p>
<p class="tat">Then on disposing the commanders of monkey army to all directions according to their
capabilities, that valorous king Sugreeva who is contented earlier by way of gaining his kingdom
through Rama, is now gladdened to his heart's content for sending monkey troops to all directions
as a requital to Rama's help. In this way when despatched by their king Sugreeva all the vanara
lieutenants expeditiously started towards one's own direction. </p>
<p class="tat">When those great mighty fly-jumpers have started to dash off some are bawling, some
highly blaring, some more thundering, and some more oddly bellowing, while some more are roaring
like lions. Well-motivated this way by the king Sugreeva those vanara lieutenants put their
fortitude into boastful words and said, "we lead forth Seetha, we wish to kill Ravana." </p>
<p class="tat">"I will kill Ravana single-handedly if he chances on battlefield, and then on
drubbing the other demons I will quickly bring back Janaka's daughter, Seetha." Another monkey
soldier said so. </p>
<p class="tat">"I alone will bring back Janaki even from netherworlds, who might be shivering owing
to enervation, and you my monkey-soldier colleagues, you all may stay behind now." Thus another
monkey-hero said. </p>
<p class="tat">"I will completely shatter the trees, shred the mountains, split the earth and storm
the oceans." Thus another monkey gave war cry. </p>
<p class="tat">"I can fly-jump a hundred yojana-s, undoubtedly," said one monkey while the other
said, "I can jump even more than a hundred yojana-s, for sure." </p>
<p class="tat">"My transit cannot be thwarted either on the plane of earth, or in the ocean, or on
mountains or in forests, or in the netherworld, or in its core." This is the slogan of another
monkey-warrior. </p>
<p class="tat">Thus each individual vanara gave war-whoops with the proper proud of his might in
the audience of monkeys king Sugreeva and departed. </p>
