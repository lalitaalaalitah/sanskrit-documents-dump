<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
Monkeys</h3>

<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 66<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Legend of Hanuma's birth is eulogised together with his innate capabilities. Jambavanta familiarises Hanuma of his capabilities giving
an account of his birth, rather what for he took birth, and extols his unready faculty. In the sixty-sixth chapter of Bala Kanda, Valmiki very
concisely narrates the birth of Seetha. But here Valmiki elaborately informs about the birth of Hanuma through Jambavanta. Some information about
Hanuma is included in the endnote.</p>

<p class="comment">There used to be many systems to beget children in the bygone eras, called
<em>kshetraja</em>, one's own, <em>aurasa</em>, in one's own wife but by other supernatural
entities, <em>niyoga</em>, in one's own though other superior human beings or supernatural beings,
and <em>kR^itrima</em>, by artificial methods like the present day cloning or by 'test tube baby'
methods, and by <em>datta</em>, adaptation etc. Here Hanuma is said to be both the
<em>kshetraja</em> as well as <em>aurasa</em> where his <em>aurasa</em> sonship is said for its

Some parables of Hanuma</p>

<p class="comment">Apart from trying to snatch Sun-fruit, Hanuma&#39;s childhood-rascaling 
was intolerable for some sages and hermits. Hanuma used to tease and tickle the sages by snatching away their 
personal belongings, by spoiling well arranged worship articles etc. Knowing that Hanuma is indomitable by the 
blessings of Brahma and Indra and all the celestials, and as a severe punishment is uncalled for, as he is simple 
little monkey, the sages gave him a minor curse. That curse is &#39;Hanuma does not remember his might on his own, 
but recollects it whenever others remind him about it...&#39; If Hanuma were to be aware of his own might, the course 
of Ramayana would have been otherwise. He would have simply enlarged his body and brought whole of Lanka island 
to Rama, as he has lifted <em>sanjivini</em> mountain, to enliven Lakshmana in the war with 
Ravana&#39;s son, Indrajit. So this was a necessary curse upon Hanuma. Hence Jambavanta had to harangue Hanuma.</p>

<p class="comment">The word <em>kapi</em> also means &#39;Sun...&#39;
<em>kam</em>= water; <em>pi</em>= drinker, drinker of waters... the Sun.
<em>kaparkayebhavaanaraaH</em> Sun, monkey, elephant are the meanings for
<em>kapi</em>. As Sun drinks waters only to give rain Hanuma drinks <em>
raama rasa amR^ita</em> to shower wisdom on anyone, may it be Sugreeva, Angada or Seetha. Hanuma is the student 
of a guru no less than Sun-god. On ascertaining that nobody is prepared to teach him scriptures, and fied him 
as a fickle monkey, he approaches Sun, as Sun is an all-knowing teacher, <em>karma saakshi</em>, 
an eternal witness of all deeds. Hanuma raises his body to solar orbit and requests Sun to accept his studentship. 
Sun declines saying, &quot;I am ever on my wheels, where can I be standstill to teach you leisurely, I have my unending 
duty to perform...&quot; and thus continued His solar traversal. But Hanuma undeterred by Sun&#39;s dismissing, still enhances 
his body, placing one leg on the eastern mountain range and the other on the western, face turned toward the travelling 
Sun. Hanuma again requested Sun in this posture saying, &quot;my face will always be towards you, in whichever orbit 
you go, but teach me...oh! God...&quot; Pleased by the pertinence of Hanuma, Sun teaches all the scriptures to Hanuma. 
So also Hanuma is a witness to all the happenings in Ramayana, like Sun, and also performing whatever duty assigned 
to him. Even today any student is asked to adore Hanuma, to obtain such a stubborn health, enduring education, 
and above all a reverential scholarship.</p>

<p class="comment">Hanuma is having a benefit of <em>icChaa 
maraNam</em> &#39;death at his wish...&#39; but he is not yet dead, believably, for he is <em>chiranjiivi</em> 
&#39;eternal entity on earth...&#39; When Rama is crowned as emperor, after his exile and eliminating Ravana, Rama and 
Seetha gave gifts to all of their friends. When it was turn to Hanuma to choose a gift, shunning the heavens or 
other higher planes or other things, he asks for living in this mortal world as long as the name
<em>Rama</em> is audible. Then Seetha blesses Hanuma with that gift saying &quot; Oh! Hanuma, wherever 
you are, there will be plenty of fruits and eatables, and further, in villages, public shelters, temples, houses, 
gardens, cowsheds, cities, and at riversides, crossroads, pilgrimages, water tanks, trunks of banyan trees, and 
on mountains, caves, peaks and wherever people stroll, your image will be installed, so that you can listen Rama&#39;s 
name, uttered by the people from all corners of the earth...&quot; Thus Hanuma is believed to be still living, as the 
name of Rama is still audible. He is also called <em>an old monkey</em> living from ages till 
now, which is reflected in Maha Bharata, when Bhima could not lift the tail of this old monkey, on his way in 
forests. Even today one can see huge images, statues of Hanuma at all these places, as said by Seetha, either 
installed ages ago, or recently.</p>

<p  class="comment">Another parable is told that Hanuma is the first one to 
script Ramayana on claytablets, recording each and every detail of what Rama did. Having finished his writing 
he brought those claytablets to Rama, to bless that work. Rama humbly said to Hanuma, &quot;I have not done anything 
great to be recorded this laboriously... I have done my righteous duty...that&#39;s all...&quot; Then Hanuma was upset. 
Dejected by the slighting away of &#39;his great deeds as simple acts of duty&#39; by Rama, Hanuma brought those clay 
tablets to seashore, recited each verse, and broke each tablet on his knee and threw them into sea. This writing 
is called <em>hanumad ramayana</em>. This work is unavailable from that time. But one tablet 
came to shore afloat on the sea, which is retrieved during the period of Mahakavi Kalidasa, and hung at a public 
place to be deciphered by scholars. On that tablet only one foot of a stanza is available. That foot says &quot;Oh! 
Ravana, those your ten heads, on which you lifted of Mt. Kailah, the abode of Shiva, are now bumped on battlefield 
by the claws of crows and eagles, know what has happened to your high-headed Decahedral pride, at the hands of 
virtue...&quot; Kalidasa deciphers this stanza and informs that it is from <em>hanumad ramayana</em>, 
recorded by Hanuma, but an extinct script. And Kalidasa salutes that clayplate for he is fortunate enough to see 
at least one stanza of <em>hanumad ramaayana</em>. It is said that none can conclusively narrate 
about Hanuma, for he is many faceted. He is symbolic for unwavering dedication to righteousness, unstinting performance 
of entrusted duties, unfailing talents in service. So the tradition holds Hanuma dear...</p>
