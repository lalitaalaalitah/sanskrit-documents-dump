<br><h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy Monkeys</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 1<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Rama in his pursuit to regain Seetha reaches Pampa Lake along with Lakshmana. Rama visualises Pampa 
Lake as a heavenly abode and narrates to Lakshmana the suffering he is undergoing due to the departure 
of Seetha, i.e., the departure of innate soul from the Supreme. Seetha is the alter ego of Rama, either 
in heaven or on earth. In heavens she is Goddess Lakshmi and she incarnates herself as Seetha on earth. 
In the first chapter of Kishkindha Kanda the elaborate description of Pampa Lake and its surroundings 
is to be taken as a two-fold narration, one pertaining to Divinity, the other to Rama, the human. The 
area of Pampa Lake metaphors with heavens, and its trees and birds with divine souls, and who incidentally 
are teachers too. The fragrant breeze metaphors with god&#39;s gift, flowers as pure knowers and knowledge, 
and the tranquil water as clear heart and so on. Rama as hero of the epic is in search of Seetha. Rama 
as god incarnate is also in search of true devotees who are entrapped in the bodies of living beings. 
The true devotees are the trees, birds, flowers, waters and other naturals except the humans who cherish 
the earthly comforts. Thus Rama&#39;s sorrowing over Seetha and Bharata is in similitude with the god&#39;s 
sorrowing for the true devotees, who needs salvation from the birth and death cycle. Hence the god incarnate 
Rama is in search of true devotee like Seetha, who is now in a distant place and needs some education 
about her release from the embodiment in Lanka. Later Rama finds Hanuma, the teacher, who will be deputed, 
to Seetha to enlighten her about her release. In the last two chapters of Aranya Kanda there will be 
some 61 verses detailing about Pampa Lake and Rama&#39;s love for Seetha. But in Gorakhpur and Eastern recessions 
there are 130 verses in this first canto of Kishkindha and some 20 verses in the fag end chapter of 
Aranya canto. In these many verses Rama expresses his deep-rooted emotion for Seetha, which the ancient 
commentators have interpreted to be the God&#39;s deep-seated love and anguish for the created souls. The 
comparison is, Rama to Vishnu, Seetha to the created soul, now captivated in the embodiment called Lanka, 
and Lakshmana as the true devout. God needs a messenger or a Messiah or as per Hindu tradition the Guru, 
the teacher. That is what Hanuma. Rama as a god incarnate is actually in search of a true teacher, for 
which the surroundings of Pampa Lake are exemplified as good surroundings for finding such a true teacher. 
As far as possible, the commentaries of ancients are given in comment section of those verses. At the 
fag end of this chapter, the mighty monkey hero Sugreeva, moving on the Rishyamuka Mountain sees Rama 
and Lakshmana entering into his territory, flees into deep forests, fearing them to be enemies.</p>

sa taam puShkariNiim gatvaa padma utpala jhaShaakulaam |<br>raamaH saumitri sahito vilalaapa akulendriyaH 
|| 4-1-1</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. 1. saH</em> = such as he is, [viz. he who took birth in Ayodhya, relegated from kingdom, exiled 
to forets, lost his wife, and who is searching for her in wilderness, such Rama]; <em>taam puShkariNiim 
gatvaa</em> = that, lotus lake [Pampa,] arriving at; <em>padma utpala jhaSha aakulaam</em> = lotuses, 
Costuses, fishes, full with; <em>raamaH saumitri sahitaH</em> = Rama, Sumitra&#39;s son,[Lakshmana,] along 
with; <em>vilalaapa</em> = lamented; <em>akulendriyaH</em> = disturbed, senses [emotions disturbed.]</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama, on arriving at that Lake of Lotuses called Pampa along with Lakshmana, which is full with lotuses, 
costuses, and fishes, lamented as his emotions are disturbed, on seeing the beauty of the Lake comparable 
with Seetha&#39;s face. [4-1-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
In this very first verse itself the auspicious nature of the land of Kishkindha is implanted. Rama as 
hero of this epic identifies his heroine Seetha&#39;s face with the tranquil sheet of lake&#39;s water, her 
eyes with the lotuses, and her quick glances with the quick swims of the fishes in the lake. Rama as 
god incarnate observes the tranquil sheet of water as the quiescence of his creation. The red lotuses 
are meditatively standing, as the devotees ready to be taken away to the feet of their god. The swimming 
fishes are seen as the souls captivated in human bodies, rushing hither and thither for salvation, which 
is hindered by the banks of life [here the banks of the lake.] Thus on certain occasions we chance to 
meet with the different points of view of Rama, one as hero and the other as god incarnate, derived 
from the metaphors or similes by the ancient commentators.</p>

saumitre shobhate pampaa vaiduurya vimala udakaa |<br>phulla padma utpalavatii shobhitaa vividhaiH drumaiH 
|| 4-1-3</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>3. Soumitri! vaiduurya vimala udakaa</em> = cat&#39;s-eye-gem [lapis lazuli] like, clear, with water;
<em>phulla padma utpala vatii</em> = she who has bloomed lotuses [Lythrum fructicosum,] costuses [Saussurea 
hypoleuca]; <em>vividhaiH drumaiH shobhitaa</em> = with many, trees, beaming forth; <em>shobhate pampaa</em> 
= magnificent is, Pampa Lake.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh! Soumitri, magnificent is Pampa Lake with its cat&#39;s-eye-gem like waters, and she with her fully 
bloomed lotuses and costuses is beaming forth, along with many trees around her. [3-1-3]</p>

<p class="comment">
The clear water is devout-soul and the bloomed lotuses are the tranquil faces of the devotees. The water 
is like cat&#39;s eye gem. Cat&#39;s eye or Lapis Lazuli is &#39; a beautiful stone consisting of calcite and other 
minerals coloured ultramarine...&#39; and a precious stone of Sri Lanka and the Malabar Coast...&#39; thus say 
Chambers and Oxford dictionaries, and it is Indian, that too South Indian specific. It is one of the 
nine gems, in <em>nava-ratna </em>combination.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Secondly the usage of <em>vaiduurya vimala udaka </em>is an often-repeated expression, which may not 
be construed only that the waters are like cats-eye or Lapis Lazule, the precious gem in nava ratna/ 
nine-gem combination. In fine composition it is <em>smaraNa alankaara </em>, a metaphorical memorabilia. 
If it were said that the water is like <em>vaiduurya </em>or cat&#39;s-eye or Lapis, it reminds us of all 
other eight gems including a diamond. As such the waters are crystalline and pellucid in their look 
like priceless gems, for water is the invaluable gem-like gift of nature and flowing waters are the 
priceless possessions for livelihood as well.</p>

or trees lustre with their mountainous peaks... [4-1-4]</p>

<p class="comment">
The mountainous trees are teachers, and their mountainous branches are the taught, that depend on their 
teachers, and both of they depending upon the Pampa Lake, the divine tranquil water... and everything 
depends on waters, as per Vedic saying: <em>aapovaa idagam sarvam...</em> waters are everything...</p>

maam tu shokaabhi santaptam aadhayaH piiDayanti vai ||<br>bharatasya cha duHkhena vaidehyaa haraNena 
cha || 4-1-5</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>5. bharatasya duHkhena</em> = of Bharata, by anguish of; <em>vaidehyaa haraNena cha</em> = Vaidehi&#39;s 
[Seetha&#39;s,] abduction, also; <em>shoka abhisantaptam</em> = by anguish, well seethed; <em>maam tu</em> 
= me, but; <em>aaadhayaH</em> = sensibilities distress&#39;; <em>piiDayanti vai</em> = distressing, indeed.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;But I, who am well seethed by the anguish of Bharata, and even by the abduction of Seetha, am indeed 
distressed by my sensibilities and their distresses... [4-1-5]</p>

<p class="comment">
In some other version like Eastern version the word Maadhava i.e., Love God Manmadha used for <em>aadhayaH</em> 
because the <em>alankaara</em> or the aesthetics demand the description of vasantha requires Manmadha. 
Then the compound is read as <em>santaptam maadhavaH piidayanniva</em> comes there, meaning that &#39;the 
Vasanta, the spring season, or the personified Manmadha, the Love God, is distressing me, besides the 
problems of anguished Bharata and abduction of Seetha.&#39; It is said that Rama remembers Bharata too, 
along with Seetha at this juncture, because as a god incarnate He remembers the sufferance of these 
innate souls dedicated to Him. Bharata is another <em>kainkarya</em> /dedicatee of Rama, the divine, 
like Lakshmana.</p>

In grief everything is disquieting, <em>duHkhite manasi sarvam asahyam...</em> but these pleasant floral 
environment of Pampa is admirable to Rama, because nature is divine.</p>

<p class="comment">
The appreciation of nature is said to be of divine nature, for the Divine creates the nature that itself 
is of Divine nature. The high crowned trees are the sessile teachers and the flowers and birds are mobile 
students, who always surround the teachers. Rama in search of some good teacher to convey his message 
to the captive Seetha finds some other great teachers of nature, but whom he cannot utilise for his 
purpose because they are sessile. He however praises them while remembering Seetha. The touch of Cupid 
is for the Rama, the Hero, and the touch of anguish in search of a good teacher is for the god incarnate.</p>

The word <em>patitaH</em> also synonyms with morally fallen. The three states of flowers viz., fallen,

<p class="comment">
The kokila is not exactly a cuckoo, for cuckoo gives out a two note call whereas the kokila gives out 
a single lengthy call with up and down of its tone, and also replies its imitative cooing of the humans. 
However it belongs to the same species of cuckoo. Here the &#39;air itself is singing&#39; has the similitude 
with singing of Sama Veda hymns, which here is coming out of mountain caves, where the caves themselves 
are the abode of the hermits and sages, who sing Sama hymns. Later in the canto the monkey heroes also 
dwell in caves, and are equated with the pre-eminent teaches who always sing in the praise of God, which 
will be as good as singing the Vedic Hymns. Now the air emerging from the caverns of yonder firmaments 
is singing Sama Veda applauding Rama, the Divine.</p>

<p class="comment">
The fragrance <em>gandha</em> always synonyms with <em>puNya</em> merit. A flower emits fragrance without 
anybody&#39;s rrequest and it is its merit. The flowers of grass are forbidden for worship, for they have 
no scent. And God is said to be <em>sarva gandhaH sarva rasaH</em> &#39;He is all the fragrance, He is all 
the essence...&#39; The appealing sounds of the birds are taken as the recitation of Sama Veda, the top 
of the trees is <em>parama pada</em> , the heavens, and the flowers are the knowledge-full seers, and 
the birds are the innate souls captivated in living beings. The flower is an essential item in the worship 
of any religion and in Maha Naarayana Upanishad we are told it to be carrier of moral merit unto god, 
like its fragrance that can be felt at a distance without any visible medium. According to; Maha Narayanopanishad 
Section Eleven, Hymn 1: <em>yathaa vR^ikShasya sampuShpitasya duuraat gandhovaatievam karmaNo duuraadgandho 
vaati -- maha Narayanopanishad ||</em>
</p>

<p class="comment">
&nbsp;Just in the same manner as the fragrance of a tree in full blossom is wafted by the wind from 
a distant place, the fragrance of meritorious deeds-- the good name that accrues from them -- spreads 
to a great distance [as far as heaven.]
</p>

<p class="comment">
Thus the corollary of the teacher and the taught is also applicable here. The flowers are the teachers 
and their knowledge is fragrance, where the taught are the birds whose cooing is the chanting of Sama 
Veda. The birds, as the captivated souls, are seeking salvation in their chanting around the teachers 
i.e., flowers to communicate the same to god, with their fragrant knowledge. This enthrals the god, 
now Rama.</p>

<p class="comment">
Prof. R. D. Ranade, the eminent professor of Indian Philosophies said that &quot;Translations are always 
bound to be uncouth; they are like a heavy cart-load which moves slowly along...&quot; So also Ramayana, 
whose text itself is a cartload, and the translations become many more cartloads. Much can be said in 
Kishkindha Kanda, for it comprises of many a derivative, which cannot be compressed and put together. 
The hero-heroine and the god incarnate aspects, together with some Indian philosophies included, are 
sufficient to become some more cartloads. The Hindu Love-god, Manmadha, unlike his European counterpart 
Cupid, has no body. At one time, Shiva burned Him down physically, for arousing lasciviousness in Shiva 
Himself. But Shiva makes the Love-god Manmadha to thrive without a physical body, at the request of 
Love God&#39;s wife Rati. Hence Love God is also called <em>an anga</em> = without, body. The bodiless nature 
and only the emotive responses in love are symbolical with the formless activity of romancing aroused 
by <em>ananga</em> or Manmadha, i.e., Love God. Alternately the word Manmadha not necessarily be taken 
as a noun, denoting the Love God alone. As a phrasal verb it denotes, mind, churning. <em>mann; manas; 
madhaH - mannamsi mathate iti manmathaH...</em> to churn. There is a platform called <em>manas</em> 
, below the subconscious level, and above sensory organs, which receives all the input from the sensory 
organs, which the manas separates, categorises, analyses and so on, and then sends to databank at subconscious 
level. Amara Kosha defines it as <em>cittantu ceto hR^idayam svaantam hR^in maanasam manaH || dhii varga</em>and 
the separation is <em>chittam, chetaH, hridayam, svaantam, hrit, maanasam, manH</em> and this is not 
the composite mind, but a faculty of reason, what we generally call, a heart, a mind, a thought etc. 
Hence the lamentation of Rama is more churned out of his manas for Seetha, not just for amorousness, 
but for real love. And love, as per good old saying, is togetherness. Having lost that togetherness, 
Rama is pouring out his heart churned agony. Yet again, Rama the god indulges in those that are indulged 
in Him, and here his thoughts are constantly indulged in Seetha, his alter ego in heavens and on earth. 
In the Vaishnava mythologies, Vishnu incarnating on earth always looses his consort, Goddess Lakshmi 
and roams over to find Her. It is the same situation in <em>narasimha</em> incarnation. Goddess Lakshmi 
is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, after which Her consort Vishnu searches and 
retrieves Her, for no one on earth can amass heavenly wealth. In Lakshmi tantra, the Vaishnava aagama 
text Lakshmi states that: <em>aham naaraayanii naama saa sattaa vaiShNavii paraa</em> &quot; I am indeed 
Naaraayanee [i.e. Lakshmi] the supreme essence of Vishnu...&quot; [Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.] Hence, Seetha may 
not be taken as yet another princess from this viewpoint.</p>

[4-1-29b, 30a]</p>

<p class="comment">
Vasanta or spring is a friendly season, and Kishkindha is a friendly place, [and Rama gets more friends 
in this place later,] but Rama&#39;s lifetime friend and supreme essence is missing. For god, this burning 
is the sensation or perception of energy as warmth shown by the devout nature, and its blessed souls. 
Shaiva/Shaakta traditions emphasises the power and majesty of the God, whereas the Vaishnava theory 
demands a heart pouring devotion to achieve the God&#39;s saving grace <em>anugraha</em> . Hence the lamentation 
of Rama as god is for the departure of his Shakti, i.e., Goddess Lakshmi, visualising all the nature 
and its component devotees he created, such as, trees, peacocks, birds, flowers, waters, mountains etc. 
All of this nature and its components are maddening Him for love from that Shakti.</p>

<p class="comment">
This point of view requires some understanding of Vaishnava canons and some <em>paancharaatra aagama</em> 
expositions. The readers may find them in a great essay of Prof. Samjukta Gupta on Pancharatra, in a 
&#39;worm&#39;s eye view&#39;, [for she calls it that way,] in a book called <em>Mantra</em> . It is a collection 
of essays on the Hindu hymns by eminent Indologists like Frits Staal, Ellison Banks Findly et al, published 
by the State University of New York Press, State University Plaza, Albany, N.Y., 12246. These are published 
under their SUNY Series in Religious Studies, and this one is under the editorship of Harvey P. Alper.</p>

<p class="comment">
For the hero in the epic, it is the want of warmth from the heroine. It may please be noted that if 
Rama addresses Lakshmana in the verse, it is a dialogue. Otherwise it is to be treated as monologue 
or soliloquy or aside or the character&#39;s heartfelt feelings, aimed for communicating to us, but not 
to Lakshmana alone. Not all the verses are spoken to Lakshmana. It is a kind of commixture of dramatics 
and narration. Here the lovelorn Rama views Ashoka trees as the arrow of the Love god, <em>manmadha</em>. 
The Love God has five arrows and they are:</p>

The iridescent eye like spots on the back plumage of the peacock are said to be like a <em>gavaaksha,

to permit the air to circulate. Even a single feather of peacock is called the eye of the peacock for 
its glittering eye like spot. Here the air is permeating these eyes on the plumage of peacock and making 
those eyes look like crystals. Thus the spring breeze is permeating anywhere, including Rama, causing 
a want for the togetherness with Seetha. Unlike other birds, the peacocks do not mate often and in open. 
It has some ritual like dancing and secret in its conduct of mating.</p>

&quot;The boons and curses in Ramayana&quot; is an exclusive subject and there are a variety of books on these 
subjects. So also, the prognostications are another subject. Special attention will be paid to the cawing 
of the crow, for Rama blessed the crow. A crow is said to have requested Rama to remove its ugly look. 
Rama instead of blessing the crow to look like a white-swan blessed it to be proficient in foretelling. 
The crow&#39;s cawing is for both good and bad omens, which even now is an accepted belief. If the crow 
roves over in the sky continuously cawing, it is bad omen. If it sits on nearby tree or wall and caws 
incessantly, it is good omen to get desired things or to indicate the arrival of dear ones etc. Such 
prognostications are available by way of bad dreams etc., at many places in Ramayana.</p>

India, one Tunga and the other Bhadra, at whose confluence it is called Tunga Bhadra. The Vijayanagara 
Empire built their capital Hampi at this place. The regional language Kannada uses &#39; ha &#39; for Sanskrit 
&#39; pa &#39; and hence Pampa is now called Hampi. Long before Vijayanagara dynasty, this place is ascribed 
to be Pampa, where the Kishkinda, the capital of monkey kings was situated. &quot;The kingdom of Vanara or 
monkey race was in the north and west of Mysore, their chief city being Kishkindha near the village 
of Hampi on Tungabhadra...&quot; Mysore and Conty Vol. I, page.178--Reie Vol. I pg. 146, and also in Bombay 
Gazetteer Vol. I pg. 142 of Dr. Bhandarkar. There are four copper plate inscriptions, dating around 
3012 BC, at Shimoga District, Karnataka State, ascribing that Janamejaya, son of Parikshat makes grants 
to the Pampa area, because his great grand father Yudhisthara of Maha Bharata rested on the banks of 
Tungabhadra at this place. However there is a vast lake like formation at present day Hospet and Hampi 
in Karnataka State, where three rivers, namely Tungabhadra, Varada and Hagari and their tributaries 
etc., meet and disperse. This place is geographically at Long. 76�--78�, and Lat. 12�--16�.</p>

Rama&#39;s tranquil heart is throbbing like the ripples in the waters, because the resident in that lotus

&quot;This breeze� let out from within the thickets of forests, breezing touching the pollen of lotuses,

<p class="comment">
This verse is well explained by the ancient commentators in many derivatives. Some of them are:</p>

<p class="comment">
1] Rama wanted to take comfort in the breeze, at least. But that breeze itself is troubling him, because 
it is carrying the fragrance of the pollen of lotuses, which is like the fragrance of Seetha&#39;s breath.<em> 
surabhi nishvashite dadatahtrishaam</em> as in <em>laxana shaastra</em> . Exhale of the beloved bears 
a kind of fragrance, which is known only to her lover. Seetha also holds the lotus dear and every aspect 
of Seetha is lotus oriented and thus Rama&#39;s remembering of Seetha by seeing lotuses. [Ibid. <em>satatam 
priya pankajaam</em> - 4-1-67.]</p>

<p class="comment">
2] Goddess Lakshmi sits in the middle of the lotus, which will be in the heart of Vishnu. As of now 
She is stolen and Rama could not avert it. Hence the lotuses are angered at the loss of their resident 
Goddess Lakshmi, are taking the help of the breeze to carry the scent of the pollen, which is akin to 
Seetha&#39;s breath, and invade Rama&#39;s heart, to regain their tenant. Then a question arises as to why Rama 
confronts the invasion of this spring breeze without going away from there. In reply it is said that 
this breeze is like Seetha&#39;s breath, and it is coming from out of the thickets of the forests. So she 
must be around and appear to him any moment. Regaining Seetha is prime ordeal than the invasion of the 
cool spring breeze.</font></p>

<p class="comment">
3] Another way of putting this is: -- <em>padma</em> </em>= Goddess Lakshmi; <em>kesara - or - kesaraiH</em> 
= affection, like fragrant pollen; <em>samshR^iSTaH </em>= carrying; <em>vR^iksha antara vi nisshruta
</em>= tree of the Universe, within it, emitted;<em> nishvaasa iva</em> = uninterrupted breathe, like;
<em>siithaayaa </em>= of Nature [Seetha the feminine, is symbolised with the whole creative Universe,]
<em>vaayuH</em> = all-pervading ether [mythical]; <em>manaH </em>= [sins of] heart; <em>haraH </em>= 
stealing/obliterating one.</p>

<p class="comment">
This is based on the <em>ashwattha </em>structure of the Universe.</p>

<p class="smItS">
1 uurdhva muulo&#39;vaak shaakha eSho ashvatthaH sanaatanaH || 2-6-1 - kaThopanishad<br>2 uurthvamuulam 
athaH shaakham ashvattha~N praahuravyaya~N ||15_1-3 - bhagavadgiita
</p>

<p class="comment">
The roots of Aswattha tree [the Holy fig tree, Ficus Religiosa, meaning that: <em>shva </em>= tomorrow;
<em>na stha</em> = not there; the tree of the Universe that will not be there tomorrow, i.e., this Universe 
perishes, are inthe firmament and its stem, branches, and leaves spread upside down as this Universe. 
This is similar to the Igdrasil of Scandinavian mythology. Goddess Lakshmi sitting in Her Divine Lotus 
in empyrean abode exhales Her uninterrupted affection as the all-pervading ether, within the tree i.e., 
Universe, which is the life principle. When the created being is endowed with Her affection, but becomes 
a sinner, She recommends even that sinner to the Almighty Vishnu for obliteration of his sins and to 
accord salvation. Hence Vaishnavites demand heart-pouring devotion to the Almighty, than indulging in 
earthly cherishing. This is termed as <em>nirhetuka satata dyaa prasaara</em> i.e., without any precondition 
the grace of Goddess Lakshmi always flows.</p>

The mountains always have similitude with kings as they stand high and noble on the land. The Himalaya 
is King Himavant, the father of Goddess Parvati, Shiva&#39;s consort. So also here the Rishyamuka Mountain, 
where Sugreeva takes asylum, is termed as a kingly mountain and Rama has not yet known the name of this 
mountain. On this mountain there are coloured dust splashes hiding the greenery of leaves, and the flowers 
are luminous in red colour, all over. This is indicating that the Kingly Mountain Rishyamuka is inviting 
the other King Rama or Rama the divine, with an incensed camphor, that will be red in glow and emits 
coloured smoke. This is the <em>mangala aarati</em> , the auspicious camphor-torch deference offered 
to kings of deities.</p>

<p class="comment">
The question of self-control of Rama in indulgence is discussed here. Rama&#39;s libido is not expressed 
after the abduction of Seetha, until his entry into the area of Pampa or its forests. Here, in these 
surroundings of Pampa, the spring season is at its height and the nature is adding fire to his fuelling 
desire. What anyone can do but to lament about his unconsummated desire? That too, when Manmadha, the 
Love God, assumes the charge of this particular Chaitra month, or spring season, it is impossible to 
play-act celibacy. For more details about such a condition, Gosvami Tulasi Das is perhaps the best poet 
to narrate in Ram Charita Manas, at Doha 73 to 76 of Baala Kaanda. Narrated in there is, that the saints 
and sages lost their loincloths, chastity belts peeled off on their own, and entire social order went 
topsy-turvy, when Manmadha took charge of the Universe for only a few moments, to kindle Shiva&#39;s love 
towards Parvati. As such the nature at Pampa itself has become a love god to Rama, to pour out his passion 
for Seetha.</p>

The word <em><em>shakraaya</em> </em>is in Dative case, meaning that the throne of Ayodhya is meant for an Indra-like 
ruler on earth, and qualifies for a demonstrative adjectival expression in its adjacency principle. 
As such Rama is pondering over negating the kingdom, i.e., the Rajya Lakshmi, in comparison with Seetha, 
who is his Bhaagya Lakshmi. Kalidasa, in Raghuvamsha, depicts what this Bhagya Lakshmi has to say, when 
Rama, basing on some satirical remarks of his lowly subject deserts Seetha.</p>

dur anvaya - wrong parsing of words in verse</p>

<p class="comment">
The above is the wrong orientation of words used in above two verses. While the word-to-word translation 
of Ramayana is rare in print medium, the prose versions are giving meanings with such orientation, and 
they will be usually found in almost all printed books. The above suggests that Lakshmana is asking 
Rama to forget Seetha, which is meaningless. The following is said to be the reasonable orientation. 
Other words being same, the rest are:</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>priya jane</em>= in dear, ones; <em>sneham smR^itvaa</em>= fondness, on remembering; <em>iidR^ishaanaam</em>= for this kind 
of; <em>a + kaluSa atmaanaam</em>= of un, blemished, souls; <em>matiH mandaa na bhavati</em>= intellect, languorous, will 
not, become; <em>viyogajam duHkham tyaja</em>= by separation, caused sadness, leave off.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On remembering the fondness for dear ones, intellect of your kind of unblemished souls will not become 
languorous. Leave off the sadness caused by separation.</p>

<p class="comment">
Such wrong orientations of words used in verses will be found in other verses also, because printed 
books are carrying them forward, and they need correction by some pundits who can kindly spare time 
and effort. The above correction is per courtesy of : Pt. Paturi Sitaramaanjaneyulu</p>

Lakshmana repeats the same words in Yuddha Kanda, the Book of War, chapter 83, verse 43, when Rama laments 
on receiving information that Indrajit, the son of Ravana killed Seetha. Here the word <em>shoka</em>

His creation. Thus the pity and fondness of god is now aimed at releasing the innate soul, namely Seetha,

The lustful words of Rama are to be construed as pure pleasure forhaving Seetha at his side, as a longing 
to have His first creation with himself. This is for deifying Rama as incarnation of Vishnu. All the 
Ramayana-s or Purana-s which deal with the episode of Rama&#39;s reaction on seeing Pampa Lake have the 
same import. In Skanda Purana there is yet another instance stating that Rama gave curses to such lusty 
components of nature, for his lust is not satiated. It is as below: -</font></font></p>
