<p class="txt">
Sugreeva orders vanara-s to search east under the leadership of Vinata, a mighty vanara. Firstly he dedicates 
all the vanara forces to Rama, but Rama desired to know whether Seetha is alive or not, and if so at what place. 
Then Sugreeva commissioning Vinata explains the topography and geography of Eastern side of the
<font color="#B3003A">jambuu dwiipa</font>, &#39;the Indian subcontinent,&#39; and its eastward, comprising whole of South-East 
Asia. This is the first chronicle ever recorded about the lands and oceans, islands and dwellers in there, as 
far as Ancient Indian Geography is concerned.</p>

<p class="comment">
Vividly: &#39;These vanara-s are acclaimed for their impossible deeds like jumping over oceans, swinging from mountains 
to mountains, even lifting mountainous mass etc., thus any impracticable task is assignable to them, and hitherto 
each and every infeasible task undertaken by them is accomplished by each of them, thus they all are dependable... 
these are not only powerful individually, but they also have overpowered their individual weariness, thus they 
pursue any task unweariedly... and these are renowned for their complicate confrontations and noteworthy manoeuvres...&#39;</p>

The mention of these two western rivers, Saraswati and Sindhu, at this eastern place, to where Vinata is being 
sent, is a disputed matter. The River Saraswati is the river of Vedic period that once coursed but later disappeared 
or is coursing underground. This river is &#39;this creative centre of Man, River Saraswati, was made by the deva-s...&#39; 
Rig Veda, 3.33.4, and &#39;all life takes its origin from your [Saraswati womb... Rig Veda, 2-4, 9-17. Presently research 
work is undertaken to find out this river under the banner &#39;Saraswati Nadi Shodh Abhiyaan&#39; and they are trying 
to find out the palaeodrainage, the buried course of this river. It is believed that this perennial river was 
flowing from Himalayas through Punjab, Haryana, Western Rajasthan, and through the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, and 
it is said that if this could be traced an abundant source of underground water could be established.</p>

<p class="comment">
Likewise, the mention about Sindhu at this place does not relate to westerly Indus River, because any river or 
rivulet is generally called Sindhu: <em>deshe nada visheSe abdau sindhurnaa sariti striyaam - amara kosha.</em> 
Sugreeva separately indicates Indus river at 15th verse, chapter 42: <em>sindhu saagarayoH caiva sangame...</em> 
Hence it is taken as another easterly river called Indusa.</p>

<p class="comment">
So also the river Mahi as said in next verse, on which Griffith says that &#39;The Mahii River rises in Malwa [Malwa 
Plateau, Madhya Pradesh, and falls in the Gulf of Cambay after a westerly course of 280 miles...&#39; But the Ancient 
Geography of India says that &#39;the mention of this river is out of place here and is probably due to erroneous 
transposition of the verses...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
It is generally accepted that many verses in these episodes of Sugreeva&#39;s narrating the geography are shuffled. 
The River Shona is present day Shon, and Kaushiki is Koshi, and she is the sister of Vishvamitra. That sage explains 
about the emergence of this river in Bala Kanda.</p>

Videha is Mithila, the kingdom from where Seetha came to Ayodhya, this and Anga kingdoms were roughly present 
West Bengal. Magadha is the famous post Buddhist period kingdom, ruling from present-day Bihar. Huen Tsong recorded 
that &#39;to the north of Magadha, River Ganga courses, to the west of it Kaashi province is there, and in east
<em>hiraNya parvata</em> [Maanghir is there, and in south <em>giraNa suvarNa [singa bhuumi</em> is there... and 
its capital is <em>kusuma pura [paaTalii putra</em> present day Patna. Next, the word &#39;<em>koshakaara</em> is 
literally a silkworm or one who makes scabbards or a lexicographer. It is also referred to the kings of these 
clans.</p>

<p class="comment">
The Yava Island is taken as the present day Jawa Island, and the seven kingdoms referred may compare to Jawa, 
Sumatra, Bali, Indonesia etc. It is believed that around 10 to 8 millennia B.C., there used to be a continuous 
landmass from Burma to Central America, which is why Maya civilization has flourished there via this route. Later 
in time due to tectonic activity, the northern India&#39;s landmass rose up and southern sunk down. [Chronology of 
Ancient Bharath, by Prof. K. Srinivasa Raghavan, published by &#39;Sri Aurobindo Study Circle, Triplicane, Chennai, 
in year 1896. It is therefore presumable that the islands of Indian Archipelago are so numerous and so nearly 
situated. However, this splintering of islands may have happened by the time of Ramayana, since the Sage-poet 
of Ramayana is citing them as <em>dwiipa,</em> islands.</p>

<p class="comment">
Regarding the difference between the names of <em>Yava</em> and <em>Jawa</em> the word <em>ya</em> in Sanskrit 
becomes <em>ja</em> in vernaculars <em>tadbhava pada</em>. Hence Yava became Java, as <em>simha pruri</em> &#39;lion-city&#39; 
became the present day <em>Singapore.</em></p>

<p class="comment">
On this point of Yava/Java island as said in Ramayana, Sri Kedarnath Basu notes in his &#39;Hindu Civilization&#39;: &#39;The 
reader may note here that <em>java dwiipa</em> described as consisting of seven kingdoms was probably the group 
of islands now called the Indian Archipelago, of which Java was at that time the most powerful. The chief islands 
of this group are Sumatra, [say, <em>su mitra</em>= good friend, Java, Bali, [the benefactor; Borneo, [or <em>
varuNa</em>, the Rain-god, and Celebes. More details are with: Vivekananda Kendra, Kanyakumari, who are publishing 
&#39;Vivekananda Kendra Patrika&#39; an encyclopaedic journal on Ancient India.</p>

<p class="comment">
Aurasa derives from the word <em>uuru</em>, meaning &#39;the thigh.&#39; The mother of this sage hid him under her thigh 
when some kings came to kill, as such he got this name. Then with vengeance this sage started to burn the world 
with his yogic fire, but his manes came to him to pacify and asked him to release his yogic fire in oceanic water. 
When he did so, that fire remained underwater, ready to emerge from a cavity like that of a she-horse&#39;s mouth, 
from beneath the ocean from the South Pole. This fire is called <em>vaDaba agni</em>, or <em>baDaba anala</em> 
, referred here as Horse&#39;s Face. At the time of <em>yuga anta</em>, End of Era, that fire emerges out, and the 
whole creation, with all its sessile and mobile beings, becomes its fuel, as said in next verse. This episode 
is detailed in <em>aadi parva</em> , First Canto, Maha Bharata.</p>

<p class="comment">
This is the irrefutable <em>sugriiva aaj~na</em>&nbsp; &#39;Sugreeva&#39;s order,&#39; and it always annexes the wording &#39;you will be killed, 
executed, or eradicated, if you fail to accomplish...&#39; which indicates his style as an autocratic disciplinarian 
of his subordinates in getting things done for his master, Rama. And he himself becomes one such subordinate before 
his masters, Rama and Lakshmana. This is the kainkarya &#39;dedication.&#39; Rama&#39;s appreciation is winnable with such 
&#39;dedication to duty, friendship, of to given word.</p>

<p class="comment">
Lakshmana&#39;s dedication is of the sort of <em>daasya bhaava</em> &#39;dedication in servitude...&#39; while Sugreeva&#39;s 
is <em>sevaa bhaava</em> &#39;a dedication in servitorship...&#39; and Hanuma&#39;s <em>bhakti bhaava</em> &#39;dedication in 
reverence...&#39; a true devotee, and thus in whatever way one shall strive, everything culminates in one selfless 
entity, the Supreme Person.</p>
