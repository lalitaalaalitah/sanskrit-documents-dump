<br><h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy Monkeys</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 18<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Rama explains to dying Vali as to why he gave such a punishment. Rama categorically explains all the 
question put by Vali in the last chapter from the viewpoint of scriptures that lay down principle for
<em>sanaatana dharma</em>, eternal tradition, as well as <em>raaja 
dharma</em>, king&#39;s duty. Vali finally concludes that there is someone superior to him and thus seeks 
refuge in Rama.</p>

<p class="tat">
Thus, Vali who is hit down by arrow and who is collapsing humbly spoke exacting words that contained 
probity, meaningfulness, and expedience, to Rama. [4-18-1]</p>

<p class="tat">
Then to him who is rendered like a lusterless sun, fizzling out like a cloud that released its water, 
and who became like a quenched fire, to such a best monkey and an unexcelled lord of monkeys who has 
just now imputed Rama with words that are abounding with righteousness and meaningfulness, Rama spoke 
subsequently. [4-18-3, 4]</p>

<p class="comment">
The words Vali spoke contain righteousness from his viewpoint, when he said &#39;How did you hit me without 
confronting me...&#39; and the meaningfulness in the words like &#39;a quarrel comes when gold and silver are 
the cause, I should have brought Ravana without bloodshed, I would have brought Maithili and presented 
before your...&#39; etc. But these words are with the death time wisdom of Vali, and they become parroted 
saying but cannot be practical with the kind of righteousness followed by Vali.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Holding his virtuous decree desiring to keep up the continuum of righteousness, we and some other kings

<p class="comment">
The 'virtuous decree to keep up virtue' <em>dharma kR^ita aadesha</em> is not
that of Bharata, but by the king <em>raaaja dharma kR^ita aadesha</em>. Bharata as younger brother
cannot order his elder, and that too, a 'would-have-been-king,' but the throne demands it to be
done by any subject, and now Bharata is in that throne. Actually Bharata did not give any explicit
orders to Rama or others making them responsible for the upkeep of dharma, on his behalf. Rama
himself orders Bharata as at: <em>tvam raajaa bharata bhava svayam naraaNaam | vanyaanaam aham api
raaja raaNmR^igaaNaam |</em> Ayodhya Kanda II, 1-674-17 'Bharata, you become the king of humans,
and I shall be the king of forest-beings...' Thus, taking responsibility on his own shoulders, in
his own duty as a Kshatriya to keep up dharma, Rama is trekking forests. Some 'other kings' roaming
like this are not detailed.</p>

Vali&#39;s question: 2] &#39;you are not punishing the wrongdoer...&#39; is answered. <em>saama daanam kSamaa dharmaH 
satyam dhR^iti</em> &#39;influencing, largesse, forbearance, probity, candour&#39; etc., will work with kings 
of equal status and worthiness in political strategies. But you are an inferior with an immodest conduct. 
Then, why should I waste that much of political manoeuvre in your regard? Thus you are eliminated straightaway...&#39; 
Vali may counter Rama in asking for a lesser punishment than killing, like exiling etc., which he has 
given to Sugreeva. For this Rama is ready to say that no other punishment is evident than the one said 
by Manu: <em>sapiNDaapatya daareShu (retaH siktvaa) praaNa tyaago vidhiiyate - - manu smR^iti</em>.</p>

<p class="comment">
Vali&#39;s question 13] &#39;I would have brought back Maithili in one day...&#39; is given an answer. Bringing 
Maithili from the captivity of Ravana would have averted Vali&#39;s death - so Vali thought. But who will 
bring Ruma, wife of Sugreeva, and give her back to Sugreeva? Vali does not consider this, and in this 
alone Vali&#39;s transgression is said to have been proved. Thus any truce between Vali and Rama is an impossible 
and improbable proposition.</p>

<p class="comment">
What all Rama wanted is the &#39;search for Seetha...&#39; not bring her to his fore. Elimination of Ravana 
is to be done by Rama alone, for which Seetha is to be located first. If a truce is struck between Vali 
and Rama, Vali straightway goes to Ravana and asks for Seetha. If Ravana yields Seetha there is no cause 
left for his elimination. Ravana for sure refuses to yield her. Then a combat ensues between Ravana 
and Vali. But Vali can combat one-to-one in a duel and he may not encounter a magical war of Indrajit 
or Kumbhakarna. Then all the demons will combine to eliminate Vali, thus the epic concludes there haphazardly. 
Other way round, if Vali seeks help of Ravana and his military to combat Rama, Vali&#39;s forces and Ravana&#39;s 
forces will come down on a handful warriors like Rama, Sugreeva Hanuma, and Jambavanta et al. Then the 
whole of monkey force will be with Vali, and these few warriors will be routed down mercilessly. Above 
all, Rama has promised Sugreeva to eliminate Vali, the abuser of tradition, and Rama becomes blameworthy 
if he fails in his word. Hence the simplest formula &#39;enemy&#39;s friend is my enemy too...&#39; works well and 
Rama followed that only.</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama is quoting a precedent from his own dynasty. Maandhaata has to impose capital punishment to a sage, 
for that sage committed some immoral act. Here also the <em>shramaNa</em> is used for a wandering sage, 
called <em>yati</em>. Because he is religious person is he to let off; a religious person&#39;s sinning 
is doubly punishable; are the problems of Maandhaata. This word <em>shramaNa</em> yati, need not be 
equated with a Buddhist monk, for they also have same titles, and Maandhaata is said to have existed 
long before Buddha&#39;s era.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="comment">
There is none to say that Vali is &#39;unkillable...&#39; or &#39;not to be killed...&#39; But to every one a doubt 
occurs as to why Rama did not come face to face with and killed him? Why hit him from a remote place? 
For these doubts, the above said arguments may not suffice or satisfactory, either to Vali or to us, 
the readers. Dharmaakuutam, the only commentary on Ramayana insofar as dharma is concerned explains 
that for us.</p>

<p class="comment">
When it is said by Rama that &#39;today only I will kill Vali...&#39; then it may be countered by saying, &#39;then 
why killing him from distance, why not confront him?&#39; If Rama comes to fore, fear may grip Vali, then 
he may take Ruma, Sugreeva&#39;s wife, and to insult, Sugreeva further, Vali may go to a distant place with 
her. Or, he may seek shelter with Ravana. Or, he may even take refuge in Rama like Sugreeva. Or, on 
seeing Sugreeva with enough support, he may summon all his Vanara army to fight with Sugreeva and his 
supporters. Then it will prolong for a time. Then the promise of Rama made to Sugreeva to accord his 
wife and his kingdom by killing Vali, also prolongs. Justice delayed is denied. Otherwise, if Vali surrenders 
to Rama, as the killing of a refugee is not a merited act, Rama has to pardon Vali. Whether Vali takes 
refuse or not, killing Vali on that day itself, and establishing Sugreeva in Kishkindha are the promises 
made by Rama, at the time of befriending Sugreeva. The word given is to be kept up. So Rama did it and 
there is no unrighteous deed done by Rama. And Vali also accepts this in the coming stanzas.</p>

<p class="comment">
Any combatant is self-assertive until he is defeated. Here Vali is telling that he came here to die 
on his own. This statement has two kinds of meaning. One is, Vali being an all-daring Vanara came out, 
in &#39; come-what-may &#39; sense and readying himself to confront even Rama, if Rama affronts him. His argument 
with Tara at the start of 16th chapter details this. He asks Tara, &#39;If Rama is a virtue-knower and a 
diligent one, how then he can sin, in killing me?&#39; Vali, unlike Ravana, never goes to a duel unless 
provoked. Vali being a wilful combatant and Sugreeva is coming for a second time with the support of 
Rama, he wanted to defeat that unknown Rama, along with suppressing Sugreeva&#39;s trivial pride. Vali promises 
Tara that he is not going to kill Sugreeva, but wanted to take him to task. On coming to field Rama 
is not evident. Then Vali wanted to see to Sugreeva first and then search for Rama. But what happened 
is the reverse of it. Perhaps gorilla war tactics started from this point onwards.</p>

<p class="comment">There are three kinds of giving. Grudge giving, duty giving, 
and thanksgiving. Grudge giving says &#39; I have to...&#39; Duty giving says &quot; I ought to...&#39; Thanksgiving 
says &quot; I want to...&#39; The first comes from constraint; the second from a sense of obligation; the 
third from a full heart. This being the saying by an unknown, Vali gave torture to Sugreeva because 
he had to, Rama gave punishment to Vali because he ought to, and Sugreeva given himself to Rama, 
because he wanted to. Rama befriends Sugreeva only to take his help in searching Seetha, because 
Danu, the demon, after release from his curse advises Rama to do so. The killing of Vali is 
incidental to that befriending. To take help of Sugreeva, he is to be uplifted from his nasty state, 
and the abuser of tradition Vali is to be resolved.</p>

<p class="comment">In <em>aananda raamayana, saara kaanDa</em> another treatise of 
Ramayana, tells that Rama not only accords salvation to Vali but accords a boon to become a tribal 
in Krishna&#39;s incarnation, and kill Krishna at the end, as retaliation to the present killing.</p>

<p class="comment">But <em>bhagavata puraaNa</em> or padma puraaNa do not quote 
this sort of sanction by Rama. It is said in Anada Ramayana only to extol Rama&#39;s kind-heartedness.</p>
