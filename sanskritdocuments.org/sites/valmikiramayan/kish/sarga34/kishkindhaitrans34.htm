wars were waged. This attribute, all-endower, is sometimes given to Lakshmana in this verse, but here Sugreeva is the giver and Lakshmana is the

[4-34-9]</p>
<p class="comment">
The above verse will be generally translated as 'A person gets attached to the
sin of killing of a hundred horses if he promises to gift one horse but fails to do so, and in
promising to gift one cow but failing in it he gets the sin of killing a thousand cows, and if he
belies to a person to do the needful help, he then gets the sin of killing himself along with his
own kith and kin...' But, it is not the sin of killing hundred horses or thousand cows, but it the
sin of killing those many numbers of killer's manes, the deified souls of one's own dead ancestors.
This is as per Manu dharma and it is detailed in Dharmaakuutam as:</p>

<p class="comment">

Maha Bharata, Udyoga parva. Killing the already dead souls is lesser sin than the killing of living
beings and committing suicide.</p>
