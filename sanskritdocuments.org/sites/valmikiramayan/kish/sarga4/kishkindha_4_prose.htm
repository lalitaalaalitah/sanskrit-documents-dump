<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Kishkindha Kanda <br>Sarga 4 in Prose</h3>

<br><p class="txt">Lakshmana explains about Seetha's abduction and their inability to trace her
whereabouts. As informed earlier by a demon freed from his curse and who became a celestial,
Lakshmana says that they are searching for one Sugreeva, King of Vanmara-s, to befriend him in
order to take help in searching for Seetha. Hanuma who is on a similar mission to befriend these
two warriors, as instructed by Sugreeva in the earlier chapter, comes to a conclusion that the
needs of both the friends would be fulfilled. Then Hanuma takes the two bothers on his back to the
place where Sugreeva is hiding from Vali.</p>
<br>

<p class="tat"> </p>
<p class="tat">Then that Hanuma, who has good deeds for his credit, on hearing the words of
Lakshmana, and even knowing that they are finely meaningful, he rejoicingly recalled in his mind
that Sugreeva's effort is going to fructify.</p>
<p class="tat">"Conceivable is the retrieval of the kingdom by that great souled Sugreeva...and for
which deed, this purposive Rama has come, and that deed desired by Rama is also achievable by
Sugreeva, and thus all this has came by..." thus thought Hanuma. Then Hanuma, the ablest flyer is
thus very gladdened...and in turn then spoke to that very learned one, namely Rama.</p>
<p class="comment">Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on the letters of Gayatri Hymn.
The letter <em>ga</em> in <em>plavagottama</em> is the 10th letter in Gayatri hymn, and up to now
9,000 verses are over, out of 24,000 of the total epic.</p>
<p class="tat">"What for you have come into these perilous forests hemming in Pampa Lake along with
your brother, for these are impenetrable forests abounding with many a serpent and animal?" Thus
Hanuma asked Rama. On hearing the words of Hanuma, Lakshmana motivated by Rama, narrated about the
great soul Rama, the son of Dasharatha.</p>
<p class="tat">"The king named Dasharatha, a resplendent one and the patron of virtue was ruling
the four-caste system with its, and by his own rectitude, for he is also bound within that
four-caste system... There is none despising him, nor he despised any and for all the living beings
he is like the Grandparent Brahma on earth...</p>
<p class="tat">"And he, King Dasharatha who performed rituals agniSToma and the like Vedic rituals
wherein he donated liberally, and this one is his eldest son, and he is renowned among people by
the name of Rama... He is the protector of all beings and the follower of father's directives, he
is the eldest one among the sons of King Dasharatha... possessor of high virtues, qualities and
royal fortune befitting to a king... but he is deprived of his kingdom, and came hither to dwell in
the forests... nevertheless, followed by me...</p>
<p class="tat">"With his wife Seetha following him, oh, highly fortunate Hanuma, this
self-controlled and highly resplendent Rama came to forests like the Sun followed by his consort
Prabha, who vanishes when the day is abated...</p>
<p class="ItrSloka">Or</p>
<p class="tat">With his wife Seetha following him, oh, highly fortunate Hanuma, this
self-controlled and highly resplendent Rama came to forests like sun with his dwindling
resplendence when the day is abated...</p>
<p class="tat">"I am the one who obtained servitude by the justness of this faithful and
knowledgeable one, and his younger brother, by name I am named as Lakshmana... He who aspires to
keep up the well-being of all the beings, and he who is merited for all comforts and respectability
is now devoid of his prosperity and predisposed to forest dwelling... such as he is, his wife is
abducted by a guise changing demon in a lonely place, of whom we know not... we know not which
demon stole his wife...</p>
<p class="comment">The aspect of 'helping the destitute' is retold here. Though Rama could have
rejoiced in the nearby forests bordering Ayodhya for fourteen years without a bother, and could
have regained his comforts and respectability, his mission to help the piteous sages and saints,
and other god-forsaken creatures had to trigger off somewhere in the deep of woods. So while in
woods his wife is stolen, paving a way for him to embark on his above mission.</p>
<p class="tat">"One named Danu, son of Diti, who acquired demon-hood by curse had said that
Sugreeva, the chief of monkeys, is a capable one, and he even said, "that great valorous Sugreeva
can know about the abductor of your wife..." saying thus that Danu is released from the curse of
his demon-hood, moved skyward and went away to heavens while becoming self-luminous...</p>
<p class="tat">"All this is informed to you, as it is as you have asked..Myself and Rama, we now
have our recourse to Sugreeva alone...</p>
<p class="tat">"He who gave away riches in charity, who obtained unequalled renown and who himself
was the lord of this world earlier, now accepts the lordship of Sugreeva... Who was a patron of
virtue and who himself was a shelterer, to whom Seetha is the daughter-in-law, such a shelterer's
son Rama is now taking shelter under Sugreeva... He who is a virtuous one and protector of all the
world, and who is the only refuge for all in earlier times... such a Raaghava, my mentor, is now
seeking refuge with Sugreeva... By whose beneficence all these people are always delighted, he that
Rama is now seeking benefaction from the lord of monkeys...</p>
<p class="tat">"By which kingDasharatha, are all the kings with all possible good attributes are
always, and at all the times were esteemed to be safeguarded as defensible kings, such king's
eldest son Rama, renowned in all the three worlds for his own sheltering the needy, has now taken
shelter under monkeys lord Sugreeva...</p>
<p class="tat">"One who is rebuffed by sadness, and even agonised by it had already sought refuge,
hence it is apt of Sugreeva to do favour in Rama's respect along with other vanara commanders..."
Lakshmana said thus to Hanuma. To Lakshmana, who is telling that piteously with tears falling out,
the eminently lettered Hanumaan said this in his return.</p>
<p class="tat">"Intellectuals of your kind, who have conquered anger and senses are to be seen by
the chief of monkeys Sugreeva, for your advent is godsend... He who is made as an enemy, very
muchinsulted, and abrogated from kingdom by his own brother Vali, that Sugreeva is roaming about
forests fearing him alone, his own brother Vali... He that son of Sun, Sugreeva, will render help
to you two, joining forces of our like Vanara-s in searching Seetha..." Thus Hanuman on speaking
melodious words with politeness, also said to Raghava as, "good, we may now approach
Sugreeva...."</p>
<p class="tat">Hanuma when said thus virtuous Lakshmana adored him customarily in the way befitting
to an envoy, and spoke this to Rama. "Raghava, as to how this monkey seems to be happy in meeting
us, by way of his narration, and he too neared us as an aspirant of some deed to be performed by
us, hence joining them seems to fulfil your mission... He is talking with a lucid expression and
pleasing facial tinge by which he seems to be gladdened at his heart... needless is telling
untruths to such a valiant son of Air-god, Hanuma, isn't it!" So said Laskhmana to Rama</p>
<p class="tat">Then he that very intelligent son of Air-god Hanuma, took those two valorous
Raghava-s to go to the king of monkeys Sugreeva. On discarding the ascetic's semblance that
estimable monkey Hanuma obtained his own monkey's form, and mounting those two valiant ones onto
his back he proceeded towards Sugreeva.</p>
<p class="tat">Hanuma, the extensively renowned heroic son of Air-god with pious mind and highly
audacious nature, is then gladdened like the one whose difficult deed is just accomplished, thus he
gladly travelled to Mt. Rishyamuka where Sugreeva is abiding, along with Rama and Lakshmana.</p>
