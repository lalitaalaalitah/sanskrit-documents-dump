the wealth god Kubera, was to the north of Himalayas. It would appear to correspond with the Kwenlun Range, which

These mountains Maanasa and Kaama are said differently in other translations, like &#39;the wish-endower Kaama and 
the bird-less Maanasa Mountains.&#39; That is to say, &#39;even birds cannot enter there then where is the question of

The Problem of Mapping and Dating Ramayana</p>


<p class="comment">On seeing the names like this <em>Yavana, 
Shaka</em> etc., some hold the view that Ramayana was written more later to Greek&#39;s invasion on India. Max Muller 
in his &#39;What Can India Teach Us?&#39; says: &#39;If I call the invasion which is generally called the invasion of the 
Shakas, or the Scythians, or the Indo-Scythians, or <em>Turushkas</em>, the Turanian invasion... 
who took possession of India, from about first century BC to the third century BC.&#39; Again classifying Sanskrit 
literature he says, &#39;we divide the whole of the Sanskrit literature into there two periods, one anterior to the 
great Turanian invasion, the other posterior to it, we may call the former period as ancient and natural, that 
of the later modern and artificial.&#39; Thus, Ramayana belonged to the modern and artificial literary period and 
Veda-s to ancient. According to Indians the <em>Turushkas</em> are not the Scythians but Turkish, 
and the <em>Yavanas,</em> are clearly the Greek. Michelson in his &#39;Linguistic Archaisms of 
the Ramayana...&#39;adds another phase called Epical period. Thus, there are three, Vedic, Epical, and the rest of 
it is modern and artificial. At the same time Max Muller says: &#39;At the time of Solomon, there was a channel of 
communication open between India and Syria and Palestine is established beyond doubt, I believe, by certain Sanskrit 
words which occur in the Bible such as ivory, apes, peacock, and sandalwood, which, taken together, could not 
have been exported from any country but India...&#39; So Solomon, Bible, Turanian invasion, Ramayana... all occasioned 
at one time, i.e., around 0 BC. So many professors, so many researchers have not said a date agreeable to Indians 
as well as to the world.</p>


<p class="comment">At one place, it is said that there was a rapport among 
these places India-Syria-Palestine and even up to Egypt, but at other place, the Indian thought, that the Indian 
had Greeks and Greeks had Indians, is dismissed. What prevents to agree that both hold up mirror to almost the 
same culture, though diverse in its practise, right from the belief of Greeks, viz., &#39;the sense of many gods are 
there near at hand&#39; to various gods, to their names, to the epical literature, and also to myths and legends and 
dramas etc, is unknown. But when it comes to dating and mapping &#39;the earliest date known for certain in Indian 
history is the invasion of Alexander in 326 BC...&#39; and &#39;The chronology has been built up form the identification 
of Sandracrottus of Greek writers with Chandragupta Maurya... yet it is said &#39;In the seventh century BC India 
was divided into sixteen <em>Mahajanapada-s...&#39;</em> as per &#39;An Historical 
Atlas of Indian Peninsula&quot;, Oxford. Peculiarly those sixteen Janapada-s did not contain the names of Yavana, Shaka 
provinces in atlases.</p>


<p class="comment">&#39;The Greeks, evidently descended from tribes who had come 
westwards from the early home of Indo-Europeans in South-Central-Asia, first settled in the land which we know 
as Greece about 2000 B.C....&#39; according to The Encyclopaedia of Myths and Legends of All Nations, Kaye &amp; Ward 
Ltd., London. Their history about Ion, the king of Helice, and his war with Elsenians, the confederacy of Lonia 
in Asia Minor etc., speaks about their origin and shuffling, i.e., from east to west and again from west to east. 
It is they who have adopted Vedic Rain-god <em>Mitra</em> as their
<em>Mithras</em> and many a temple was built all over Europe for Mithras. Even Goddess 
Lakshmi has Her counterpart in Greece &#39;Pallas Athene&#39; known as early as 2 B.C., and the comedies of Strattis, 
like Fragmenta Comic of Greece has Indian fables as early as 400 B.C. Hence, if these Theories of Borrowing are 
negated with the Theories of Commonality, it would suffice to say that Ramayana is antecedent to the settlement 
of Greeks in Greece itself.</p>


<p class="comment">Without lingering on these carbon-testing for the verses 
of Ramayana that contain Yavana and Shaka named provinces, if the astronomical data available in Ramayana itself 
is believed, it throws some light on dating. If anybody would care to see the book <em>Vastav 
Ramayan, by Dr.P.V.Vartak, in Marathi, Vedvidnyana Mandal, Pune,</em> and a web site is available about this,
<em>Astronomical Dating of the Ramayana</em> where another approach 
can be seen, which just does not revolve around one or two names of places. It is said there; &#39;Therefore, Ramayana 
&#39;must have&#39; occurred 9600 years ago, which is 7600 B.C. approximately...&#39; which again is disputable because this 
is going against the <em>Yuga and Kalpa</em> Theory of Puraana-s, as Ramayana is said to be 
the legend of <em>Treta Yuga</em>.</p>


<p class="comment">The provinces Shuurasena, Bharata, Kuru are the downlands 
of Himalayas. The Kaambhoja is the province northwest to India, where the Russia touches India, as mapped by &#39;An 
Historical Atlas of the Indian Peninsula&#39; of Oxford University. Then the Yavana and Shaka should be around there, 
prior to their migration to the presently known Greece, because Greeks originated from so called &#39;South-Central-Asia&#39; 
as called by the historians, and perhaps the historians might be hesitating to call it as &#39;Himalayan region of 
India&#39;. They were originally called Ionians, a corrupt or generic name from Indian naming of Yavana or Javana. 
The word Æoni can be cleaved as <em>a + yoni; [ayogya ] yonim gata</em> &#39;unbefitting, uterus, obtained 
birth...&#39; &#39;one who is born to an unbefitting mother... say, a bastard...&#39; That is what Œdepus Rex proved later. 
The ethics of these Yavana and Shaka cultures are clearly explained in
<em>Karna-Shalya samvaada</em> &#39;the debate of Karna and Shalya...&#39; 
in <em>Karna parva, Maha Bharata.</em></p>


<p class="comment">The Shakas are again the nomadic tribes inhibiting Central 
Asia, and they are the Scythes of Greeks and the Indo-Scythians of Ptolemy, inhibited in the Hindu Kush Range 
of Himalayas. Both of these are categorised under Mleccha people by Ramayana because their ethics do not conform 
to the Vedic stipulations of living, even though they lived together.</p>


<p class="comment">&#39;The Varadas - The Bengali recension has Daradas instead. 
They are said to be Dards whose name is still retained in modern Durdstan along the course of the Indus, above 
the Himalayas, just before it descends to India...&#39; Griffith, Ancient Geography.</p>


<p class="comment">It may be noticed that Ramayana did not refute any other 
religion, or sects, or the divergent philosophies of Hinduism itself, but it has agreed that Mleccha-s are there 
and there is no bother from them. Gods of Ramayana are purely Vedic, unlike the later time, rather modern or artificial 
literary period&#39;s poetry of Kalidasa et al, and their puranic deities like Kali, Uma, and Kumara etc. The literary 
style of Ramayana is mostly un-Paninian. It has the episodes like <em>
Rama-Jaabaali samvaada</em>, where Sage Jaabaali being a nihilist starts preaching nihilism to Rama. When this 
epic could accommodate information about nihilists&#39; preaching nihilism to Rama, it can as well afford a few lines 
of information about other philosophies, religions, if they were to be there. Then the present day&#39;s Unity in 
Diversity is not apparent and thus it is being assigned to a post-Vedic period, where Veda-s themselves are not 
written by some good old sages with white beards, sitting under banyan trees, at any one particular time.</p>


<p class="comment">Because the ancient history of Greeks came to light firstly, 
thereby India history is chronicled, and the epic Ramayana is known subsequently, relegating the history of Ramayana 
later to the Greek&#39;s invasion on India, may not be appropriate. History has its own black-ages.</p>
