<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
Monkeys</h3>

<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 15<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">Lady Tara is entered here. She is the granddaughter of Brihaspati, the Jupiter and wife of Vali and she is one of the exemplary
females in this epic. She is entered only thrice in the vast of this epic, presently here, next at the fall of Vali and later to pacify the ire of
Lakshmana. But her personality for analytical intelligence does not exit from the minds of readers. Here she advises Vali not to confront Sugreeva,
as long as Rama stands guard to him. Further she says after a logical discourse and reasons, why not Sugreeva be made the Prince Regent of
Kishkindha, even at this juncture, where she foresees a calamity to Vali. But Vali, maddened in his intellect by his brawny might slights her far
fetching advice.</p>

[4-15-21b, 22a]</p>
<p class="comment">For the above three stanzas very lengthy commentary is rendered of which some
points are detailed here. Lady Tara is elucidating the whole being of Rama as gathered by her from
her son Angada. The second foot of verse 19 starts with the words <em>nivaasa vR^iksha</em> a
habitable tree; if it be asked why Rama is compared with a tree, then it is said that tree requires
no formalities like 'may I come in...' or 'rights of admission reserved...' etc., as with any other
house or habitation, for taking hold of its shade. A tree first gives its shade to the traveller
who seeks it and then affords its fruits or flowers satisfying the basic needs of the needy. So
Rama is such a tree that protects and nourishes, should anybody seek his grace.</p>
<p class="comment">Next is <em>saadhuunaam</em> for polite supplicants he is the ultimate course.
Tara is saying indirectly that Vali is not at all polite in treating Sugreeva either as crown
prince of Kishkindha or as his own younger brother. As such Vali cannot supplicate to Rama at this
stage for his impoliteness to Sugreeva and to Ruma, wife of Sugreeva, which is intolerable to Rama,
and hence Vali shall not confront Rama. <em>aartaanaam</em> for earnest and anguished supplicants
Rama is the ultimate recourse. This is what later said in Bhagavat Gita at 9-22, <em>yoga skhemam
vahamyaham...</em> Vali may dismiss this idea saying that 'if Rama is the ultimate course for the
polite supplicants, I have my recourse to other supreme lords, i.e., none other than Indra, my
father...' And for this Tara is supplementing her thought in saying, <em>yashasaH ca eka
bhaajanaH</em> the grace Rama is the only ultimate abode, where Indra and others are but
penultimate. Hence as long as Rama is standing guard to Sugreeva, Sugreeva cannot be trivialised
and this again as said in Bhagavad Gita, <em>na me bhaktaH praNashyati...</em> at 9-31.</p>
<p class="comment">Alternately, it is again as said later in Gita at 7-16 that <em>chaturvidhaa
bhajante maam...</em> 'four kinds of devotees worship me...' Those four are, one who is seeking
knowledge <em>saadhuunaam</em>; those that are interested in salvation, <em>kaivalya kaamuka</em>;
like King Priikshit. One seeking of material gains <em>aapannaanaam</em>; those that seek the
material gains that were not there previously to them, also called <em>artha ardhii</em>; like
Sugreeva, Dhruva. One who is distraught <em>aartaanaam</em>; those that are in anguish like
Gajendra, the Elephant caught in lake by crocodile in <em>gajendra moksha</em>. And the fourthly
one who is a wise person <em>yashasaH j~naani</em>; gloriously enlightened one, like Shuka, Sanaka,
Naarada, Bhiishma, Prahlada. And this wise one is impossible to exist and if he is there 'he is my
soul <em>j~naanii tu aatmaiva me matam...'</em> Gita 7-18.For all these four kinds Rama is
<em>...eka bhaajanam...</em>, the only recourse.</p>
<p class="comment">Next is <em>j~naana, vij~naana sampatti</em> In that <em>j~naana</em> is privy to
the materialistic, worldly, kingly affairs. <em>vij~naana</em> is the knowledge derived from the
scriptures, providentially profound. Or, through <em>karmadhaaraya, j~naanaH ca asau vij~naa
sampannaH ca...</em> corporeally he is the knowledge, and spiritually he is gnostic as well. Hence
he is the phenomenon of the Supreme Being in maintaining dharma. In order to maintain that dharma
Rama is now observant of his father's orders <em>pituH nideshe nirataH</em>. This pursuit of
father's orders is but one of the many other attributes of his dharma, and that alone is said here
as secondary attribute, <em>upa lakshaNa</em>. Hence in pursuing his dharma Rama may eradicate
<em>adharma</em> of Vali, insofar as Vali's misdemeanours towards Sugreeva and his wife Ruma are
concerned. <em>guNaanaam aakaraH</em>; with his auspicious merits he is a Great Mine. Usually these
<em>guNa</em>-s, attributs of Vishnu are six as per Vaishnavaite classification, con solidating
them as <em>ShaDguNa sampatti</em> , which are <em>aishvarya, viirya, yashas, shrii, j~naana,
vairaagya</em>. And there are many more in the depth of the soul of Rama hitherto unexcavated. As
such, there are innumerable and auspicious elements, or merits, in him <em>dhaatuunaam
shailendraH</em>. These elements neither subdivide nor shake him off his Himalayan personality, in
the pursuit to establish dharma.</p>
