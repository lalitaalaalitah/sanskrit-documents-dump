<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Kishkindha Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 36 </h3>

<br><p class="txt">Sugreeva's apology pacifies Lakshmana. On knowing that Lakshmana is pacified by
Tara's reasoning Sugreeva makes his apologetic statement and affirms his support to Rama. Then
Lakshmana's rage comes to a halt and he too is appeased by the open declaration of Sugreeva about
his adherence to Rama, and Lakshmana asks him to come to Rama.</p>
<br>
 
<p class="verloc">- - - .</p>
<p class="tat"> </p>
<p class="tat">In that way when Tara has submissively argued with words containing probity,
Saumitri gave assent to her perspective as he is soft by his nature. And when Lakshmana conceded to
that argument of Tara, Sugreeva, the king of monkey-troops, got rid of his highly intense scare of
Lakshmana, like the riddance of a dampened cloth. </p>
<p class="comment">This may be said as: 'Sugreeva lost his scare as a dampened cloth looses its
water on squeezing it. But here there is no squeezing.</p>
<p class="tat">Sugreeva, the king of vanara-s, then ripped apart the superb garland which is so far
enwreathing his neck, and which has several strands according several gratifications, and he also
became sober as though the insobriety is ripped from his mind. Sugreeva who is the most powerful
one among all vanara-s, then placatingly spoke this humble sentence to Lakshmana, whose prowess is
most formidable. </p>
<p class="tat">"My prosperity, prominence and this perpetual kingdom of monkeys are once mislaid,
but oh, Soumitri, I regained all this just by the beneficence of Rama. Who is capable of requiting
Rama, oh, prince Lakshmana, even by a fraction of that kind of inestimable help taken from him, as
that lord is renowned by actions particular to himself, like daring and eliminating Vali.</p>
<p class="ItrSloka">Or</p>
<p class="tat">"Who is capable of repudiating such a lordly Rama, even by a fraction of one's own
bravery, unless he is prepared to tread that kind of path on which Vali has gone. </p>
<p class="tat">"Virtue-souled Raghava reacquires Seetha, and even exterminates Ravana by himself
with his own resplendence, while I and my assistance remain only in name. Basically, why some
measures of succour need be extended to him who has ripped seven gigantic-trees, a mountain, and
even the earth, all just with one arrow! He who outstretches his bow with a clangour by which the
earth with its mountains quakes, oh, Lakshmana, to him these aides are really of what aid, indeed!
Lakshmana, I just can tread behind that king of people, Rama, on his charging to eliminate enemy
Ravana along with all of his vanguards, that's all. If I have overstepped either in faith or
friendliness, in the least, that may be pardoned for I am an attendant of yours. By the way, none
is unoffending. </p>
<p class="comment">As to why and how the offence of one's own folk is to be pardoned, is explained.
<em>kimcit</em> 'in the least...' if the fault is very negligible it is to be excused, for greater
the intensity of the mistake, greater will be the impossibility to pardon, and to my mind it
appears that I have not committed any fault in the least. <em>yadi</em> 'if at all...' any fault is
there, now there is none at all, but if you think there is a trace of if, you pardon it.
<em>vishvaasaat</em> 'by faith...' taking the advantage of the faith you reposed in me, I have not
done any wrong. <em>praNayena</em> 'in friendliness...' taking our friendship as a casual
connection and thinking that Rama will not harm me even if were to do whatever I like... even thus
I have not offended. <em>preSyasya</em> 'moved by my will...' I have not committed any crime
<em>manasaa, vacaa, karmaNaa</em> 'by mind, speech and action... or, by body, mind and soul...' But
if you still estimate that I have offended you, you ought to pardon for I am yours, and if you go
on punishing your own folk for very small reasons, who is there that is not a wrongdoer, whom do
you leave off, and at the end who are they that remain to be protected by you?' Seetha also says
'who is there that causes no offence?' in Sundara Kanda.</p>
<p class="tat">Lakshmana is pleased with that great-souled Sugreeva who is speaking thus, and said
this he said to him, indeed, in friendliness. </p>
<p class="tat">"In anyway, my brother indeed has a defender with him, oh, king of vanara-s
Sugreeva, especially you, who are a defender of your own word and a deferential one towards Rama.
With this kind of preponderance and plainness you possess, Sugreeva, you are the only merited one
to enjoy this unexcelled kingdom of monkeys. Before long, Sugreeva, dauntless Rama will be
eliminating enemies in a war with you as his supporter, there is no doubt about it. You are the
knower of virtuousness and gratefulness and you do not retreat from battlegrounds, or, on your own
word, thus what you have said is conclusive as well as coherent. Even though one has capability to
know his own lapse and speak it up, oh, ablest among Vanara-s, who is he that behoves outspokenly,
excepting my elder brother and you. </p>
<p class="tat">"You are a coequal to Rama by your valour and vigour and oh, best one among monkeys,
gods have given you after a long time. </p>
<p class="comment">The godsend and God-given has some discussion, where mythological import is that
these Vanara-s are God-given and they existed even before the birth of Rama as Brahma ordered all
gods to their progeniture. But Lakshmana is saying that Sugreeva is godsend gift and that too after
a long time of their searching for Seetha, as thy have come searching for Sugreeva according to the
advise of demon Kabandha.</p>
<p class="tat">"However, you quickly start from here along with me, oh, brave one, and embolden
your friend who is anguishing in the despoilment of his wife. </p>
<p class="tat">"Oh, friend, on hearing that which querulously spoken by Rama, who is downhearted in
his anguish, I too reflexively spoke bitter-words to you, and thus whatever I spoke that may be
pardoned.</p>
<p class="comment">This expression has detailed commentary insofar as the man-god relation.
<em>ucyamaano api paruSam na uttaram prati padyate</em> 'though harsh words are spoken to Rama he
does not rebut them...' This is evident when Khara, Duushana, Trishira, Vali, and other opponents
confronted Rama. But here Rama querulously spoke of Sugreeva before despatching Lakshmana to
Sugreeva. Because Sugreeva is his own adherent and such adherents to duty should not sidetrack
themselves into earthly matters when an incredible mission is to be completed by them. That is why
Rama came searching for Sugreeva alone basing of the information given by Kabandha.</p>
<p class="comment">If 'to err is human...' but 'to realize that error and making amends to it is
divine...' That is what Sugreeva has done, at the suggestion of Hanuma, saying that: 'You pay
deference to him with your forehead-bent...' as at 4-32-21. Sugreeva openly comes out to declare,
'who is he that does not err?' but he equally has the courage to accept what is amiss with him.
From this it is concluded, that even if one does wrong, or sins, if he repentantly seeks pardon,
his god, any god chosen by that devotee, will pardon him. This is the <em>a kimcinatva</em>
'selflessness in the least...' This is one among the many tenets of <em>sharaNaagati</em>
'dedication...' and this dedication is by <em>manasaa, vacaa, karmaNaa</em> 'by mind, speech and
action... or, by body, mind and soul...' That is why Sugreeva says that he has not wronged by
<em>vishvaasaat, praNayena, preSyasya</em> i.e., by body, mind or soul... so I am a true
dedicate.</p>
<p class="comment">Then it may be asked as to why Lakshmana is enraged at Sugreeva. This is replied
in two fold, 1] unable to see his brother's anguish Lakshmana vented out his ire; 2] Lakshmana
being a total dedicate he wanted to reprimand the new dedicate Sugreeva and save him from his
fickle-mindedness. That is why Lakshmana says sorry for what he has uttered in ire, earlier to the
assertion of Sugreeva of his faithfulness. He asks Sugreeva to come to Rama, not to console Rama,
but to embolden Rama saying that there is a real adherent in Sugreeva.</p>
