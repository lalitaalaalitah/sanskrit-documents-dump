<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
Monkeys</h3>

<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 30<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><p class="txt">Rama's exaltation of <font color="#B3003A">sharad R^itu</font> post-rainy or pre-autumnal season is the theme here. This season, which
will be conducive to lovers, is painful to Rama in the absence of Seetha. This agony is compounding and turning into his ire, since Sugreeva's
efforts in searching for Seetha are neither seen nor heard. Hence, Rama sends Lakshmana as an envoy to Kishkindha to decide whether Sugreeva's
support is there or liquefied in the spree of his drinking and merrymaking.</p>
