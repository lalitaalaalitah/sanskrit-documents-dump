<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Lady Tara rushes out to reach her slain husband while the monkey generals seek of her to anoint Angada 
as king immediately or leave Kishkindha, for Sugreeva and his men may come occupying the city. She chides 
their advises away and proceeds to meet Vali. She arrives at that place, sees Rama and his brother Lakshmana, 
her husband Vali and his brother Sugreeva. She faints and wails for the departing soul of Vali.</p>

<p class="comment">
There is a grammarian's problem in this verse. The word <em>chet</em> usually
used for ' if...' Then the meaning obtained is "If a brother is felled by his brother for the sake
of kingdom, what if and why do you fear?" Then this may not justify Tara's decency. And if this
<em>cet</em> is taken as <em>prashnaarthaka</em> 'interrogative...' then it may mean that she is
trying to ascertain whether Vali is dead or still alive, to have a last glimpse. And enquiring in
anguish would be normal in such situations. It may be correct to use 'whether' because it ensues
'not' and also as an alternative interrogative. And 'if' is used it is 'if of ignorance' but not
'of certainty' or 'of chance'. Anyway she is interested in information and orderliness of
monkeys.</p>

<p class="comment">
Some commentators negate this simile of tiger to Rama, saying it abhuuta upama &#39;impossible smile...&#39; 
By virtue Rama himself is the lion-king and comparing him with a lesser animal like tiger is objected, 
though Rama did not eliminate Vali for flesh or meat. The word shaarduula textually means a tiger in 
the present day context. For this commentators bring in the rulebook vyjayanti which says shaarduula 
also means a lion <em>-si~Nho mR^iga indraH pa~ncaasyo haryakShaH 
shveta pi~NgalaH vyaadiirnaasyo mahaanaadaH shaarduulo amita vikrama</em></p>

He who is like a sanctum that is hitherto worshipped by all people, that is decorated with flags and

sanctum, and Tara saw such a Vali plumped on the ground. [4-19-24]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>chaitya</em> is not to be confounded with Buddhist monastery. In villages, even today, people will 
prepare a makeshift sanctum adorning it with a podium and flags for worships, and that being an open 
place snakes sneak in, for which eagles will come and sit on the flagstaff, and when catching its prey 
that eagle kicks off the flag post, and by the fall of that flagstaff that makeshift sanctum gets plumped 
onto ground.</p>

<p class="comment">
This verse reminds us of the results from brotherly love-hate, younger-elder brother relation. Lakshmana 
is appearing behind Rama while Sugreeva, over dying Vali.</p>
