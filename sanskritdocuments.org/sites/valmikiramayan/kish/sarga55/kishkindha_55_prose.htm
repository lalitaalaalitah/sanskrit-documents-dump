Kishkindha Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 55 </h3>

<p class="txt">
Monkeys decide to fast unto death as they failed in executing Sugreeva command. Sugreeva already said that anyone 
returning after timeframe might deem himself as dead. Thus, Angada casting aspersions on Sugreeva and his ruthless 
commands, takes this decision on many counts. All the other monkeys follow the suite.</p>

</p>

<p class="tat">
On hearing the polite and righteous words of Hanuma, which are just yeomanly towards Hanuma&#39;s lord, namely Sugreeva, 
Angada said these sentences. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Un-deducible in Sugreeva are his steadiness, or harmlessness, or frankness, also thus salience, or even valiance, 
further more cleanliness of heart or soul. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Which Sugreeva has arrogated his elder brother&#39;s wife when that elder brother is still alive and well, where 
she is morally his motherlike, an empress and a lady love of that elder brother, thus he is despicable, and which 
Sugreeva closed the mouth of the cavity when his brother in all his belief assigned and stationed him alone at 
the mouth of the cavity to fightback the demon Dundubhi if he tries to escape, all the more when his own brother 
is still inside the cavity, thus he is nefarious, how then he can be said as one conversant with moral rectitude? 
Which Sugreeva has overlooked no less than the great glorious Raghava, whom he truthfully befriended and from 
whom his own task of arrogating my kingdom by eliminating my father is facilitated, how then can he remember the 
good services of others like us? </p>

<p class="comment">
For this statement Hanuma may retort saying &#39;Sugreeva has not overlooked Rama but otherwise engrossed in material 
comforts. He sent all of us all over to search for Seetha in requital to the help rendered by Rama... is it not 
the upright conduct of Sugreeva?&#39; For that Angada is ready with an answer as.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;He has ordered and sent us for searching Seetha owing to the fear from Lakshmana, but not as a coward fearing 
his own unscrupulousness, how then can scrupulosity be manifest in him? Who is that respectable one who can put 
belief in Sugreeva, while that Sugreeva is shameful by his shameless act of eliminating my father, and unmindful 
of tradition in usurping my mother and throne, and unthankful in requiting Rama by himself, instead of using us 
as pawns, and changeful in ignoring his promise to Rama, but in fearing for Lakshmana? Will it be possible especially 
for one like me belonging to his family? </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Whether a son is honest or dishonest he alone is investable in the kingdom. How then can Sugreeva let me, the 
one from the family of his enemy, live on? </p>

<p class="comment">
This is in reply to Hanuma&#39;s advise, &#39;he establishes you only in kingdom, as before...&#39; as at 4-54-20. But Hanuma 
cannot rebut Angada for he has no valid proof to show to Angada about Sugreeva&#39;s goodness towards Angada, as sermonised 
by Hanuma in the earlier chapter. Hence, &#39;better to follow the leader, than to argue...&#39; is the only option left 
to Hanuma.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;My slyness in planning to live in Black Hole has backfired, I am now culpable in not finding Seetha being the 
troop leader, and I am a powerless as you all are Sugreeva&#39;s side, how then can I live on indeed after reaching 
Kishkindha, like caitiff turned into a wretch. Indeed he surceases me by some mysterious trammelling punishment, 
for that Sugreeva becomes disingenuous, ferocious, also barbarous just for the reason of his kingship. Fast unto 
death behoves me than trammels and tramples, thus you all be acquiescent to my proposal and you may go back to 
your dwellings. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;I am reiterating to you all that I do not wish to go to the city of Kishkindha, and here only I sit fasting unto 
death, as death alone is expedient to me. On my behalf Raghava-s wellbeing may be enquired firstly paying deference 
to them, so also the wellbeing of my paternal uncle and king may be enquired, only after paying deference to that 
lord of vanara-s. </p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;My step-mother Ruma may be asked after regarding her healthiness. And it will be apt of you to solace my mother 
Lady Tara, who by her nature is a warm-hearted and austerely lady who cherishes her son more, and such as she 
is she will obviously leave off her life on hearing that I breathed my last.&quot; So said Angada to all monkeys.
</p>

<p class="tat">
On speaking to that point and after paying deference to older vanara-s available there, Angada puling glum facedly 
reclined on the sacred grass spread on ground. Apropos to Angada&#39;s recumbency on ground, the other outstanding 
Vanara-s snivellingly sluiced down seethingly effusive teardrops emotionally. </p>

<p class="tat">
While disesteeming Sugreeva but esteeming Vali, all of the vanara-s have gathered around Angada deciding to sit 
down for fasting unto death in step with Angada. Those best ones among fly-jumpers on discerning the words of 
Angada, the son of Vali, and agreeing to what all said by Angada as appropriate, they positioned themselves on 
the sacred grass after touching waters sacramentally. The sacred-grass is spread as sacred beds to cast off their 
lives. The edges of grass blades are positioned southward. As they are on that northern shore of southern ocean, 
all those best monkeys who are bent on to self-immolation, they became recumbent facing eastward. </p>

<p class="comment">
Here Maheshvara Tiirtha says that &#39;an apprehensive dread swept over them subconsciously...&#39; not because of the 
past episodes, but due to some future events, where their becoming pray to some unknown carnivore, namely Sampaati, 
is apprehended. Thus, their fasting unto death, as per scriptural sanction is going to fail.</p>

<p class="tat">
While those many fly-jumpers who mirror up great mountaintops by their physique are recumbent discussing stridently, 
the entrails of caves of mountain are rendered strident, and that mountain itself appeared like skyscape filled 
with strident clouds about to burst a good fortune. </p>
