<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><p class="txt">Sugreeva is disturbed at the unfounded anger of Lakshmana and wanted his ministers to elicit the cause for that anger. Hanuma informs
Sugreeva that causing delay is the only fault of Sugreeva, for which Sugreeva is advised to pray for the mercy of Lakshmana personally.</p>

<p class="comment">The word <em>a + sthaana kupitam - a + sthaana kopam</em>, is twofold in its meaning, one is 'unfounded anger' and the other is 'angered
out of place, context.' Lakshmana who has so far not visited Kishkindha has darted into Kishkindha and showing his ire here, which is out of context.
Lakshmana should have summoned Sugreeva or any other monkey, or he should have come as a calm and collected emissary, and then he can become ireful
if Sugreeva rejects any help. But Lakshmana's entry itself is 'unfounded or unreasonable.' This one statement of Sugreeva makes him lofty of virtue
in his heart of hearts for he reposed full confidence in Rama and thus fearless of a trusted friend.</p>
