<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Kishkindha Kanda in Prose<br>Sarga 56 </h3>

<p class="txt">Sampaati hears about Jataayu's death when Angada cites it while lamenting for their
misfortune. He praises that Jataayu is better off than the vanara-s for he encountered Ravana and
attained martyrdom. On listening his brother's name and news of his death, Sampaati, who firstly
wanted to gluttonise all the vanara-s, seeks their help to lower him down from mountain heights, to
listen more of his brother Jataayu.</p>
<br>
 
<p class="verloc">- - - .</p>
<p class="tat"> </p>
<p class="tat">At which mountain's tableland those monkeys sat down for self-immolation, to that
area the elder brother of Jataayu, a kingly eagle known as Sampaati by name, one renowned one for
his forcefulness and aggressiveness, and a celebrated and sempiternal sky-flying eagle has arrived.
On coming out of the cave of the great-mountain Vindhya, Sampaati is gladden at heart to see the
monkeys sitting down there, and he spoke these words.</p>
<p class="tat">"Whether it is good or bad, fate indeed follows humans in this world procedurally,
why because, this fated and long-waited food has now come nigh of me... I wish to eat them
frugally, killing one by one and eating one by one, preying on one on one day, and then preying
upon the other on the other day..." thus that bird spoke those words on seeing the massy
fly-jumpers.</p>
<p class="comment">Here some translate this as 'I wish to eat the one by one as and when that
monkey falls dead, then the next, on its falling dead...' In such a case, Angada would not have
bothered or feared for this eagle, because it wants to vulture upon a cadaver. No need to fear if
death occurs prior to their becoming prey to Sampaati. He feared to become the prey of eagle,
whereby their sacred immolation is also going to fail along with other failures like searching
Seetha, transgressing timeframe, hiding in Black Hole etc. Besides, a vulture is the most
unpredictable bird, if it comes to it food.</p>
<p class="tat">On hearing the words of that gormandising bird, Angada became highly breathless and
then spoke to Hanuma. "Look! In the name of an eagle, the son of the Sun, Yama, the Terminator, has
manifestly arrived at this area for the fatality of monkeys... thus ill luck is still haunting
us...</p>
<p class="comment">Some mms have the name of Seetha compared to Yama, saying that Yama come in the
name of Seetha, while some say it is Sampaati. Here Sampaati is taken as the manifestation of
Death, rather than Seetha.</p>
<p class="tat">"We fulfilled neither Rama's task, nor the decree of our king, but this unknown
catastrophe has abruptly bechanced for the monkeys... You all have heard in its entirety what deed
the kingly Jataayu has done wishing to do good to Vaidehi... Like that, all beings, even those
birthed in animality, are doing what that is agreeable to Rama even on forgoing their own lives, as
with us... Even animals will be mutually succouring by their instinct of concern and camaraderie,
therefore, let each of us leave off our souls, soulfully...</p>
<p class="tat">"Conscientious Jataayu has done a deed much liked by Rama, and we too have been
trekking the forests without caring even for our lives in the cause of Rama, but we have not seen
Maithili... He that kingly eagle Jataayu who is killed by Ravana is a happy soul, and he is even
relieved from the fear of Sugreeva as he departed on the Avenue of Sublimity...</p>
<p class="comment">Sugreeva is not only the sovereign of monkeys but to all animal worlds also, and
even to all birds of Aves kingdom, <em>nidificatis aves, apes, oves...</em> as Virgil would say. So
slain by Ravana, Jataayu is absolved of sin and fear of Sugreeva, as well. Maheshvara Tiirtha.</p>
<p class="tat">"By the ending of Jataayu and by the end of Dasharatha, also by the purloin of
Vaidehi, all of the monkeys are piled into a predicament...</p>
<p class="comment">Vividly: 'If Jataayu is not killed Seetha would not be abducted, even if Seetha
is abducted, should Jataayu be living he might have detailed that abduction, and Rama might not
have come to Kishkindha, but would have gone to Lanka straightaway. At least, if Dasharatha is not
dead he would have called Rama and others back to Ayodhya, thus the question of Seetha's abduction
does not arise. Because these two are dead, Seetha is abducted and their deaths became a deadly
predicament for us... the monkeys...'</p>
<p class="tat">"Just by giving boons to Kaikeyi, the quandaries like Rama's dwelling in forests
along with Seetha and Lakshmana, as a result Rama's fury eliminating complete demons of
Janasthaana, and as a result Raghava's arrow exterminating Val, have come to pass." Thus Angada is
lamenting. On observing the monkeys who lay recumbent on ground and on hearing them eulogising the
death of Jataayu he that king of eagles Sampaati is highly perturbed at that uncomfortable
information about Jatayu, and that high minded Sampaati sorrowfully spelled out this word.</p>
<p class="comment">Some versions of Valmiki Ramayana end this chapter with this verse and continue
next verses in the next chapter.</p>
<p class="tat">That shredder-billed eagle Sampaati said this sentence voicing thunderously on
hearing words voiced by Angada. "Who speaks to announce as though to quake my heart that Jatayu,
the more precious brother of mine than my own lives, is slain? How a combat occasioned between that
eagle and a demon in Janasthaana, and how am I hearing this name of my brother after a long time...
I wish you to get me down from these mountain soars. After a long time I have heard about my
younger brother who is straightforward, praiseworthy for his valour, and I am glad that too spoke
of him praisefully... Thereby, oh, best vanara-s, I wish to listen about the death of my brother
Jataayu when he was in Janasthaana... Whose eldest and dear son is Rama, the creditable one for
doyens, that Dasharatha is the friend of my brother Jatayu/ But how did Dasharatha pass away?</p>
<p class="tat">"I am incapable to spread my wings widely as they are burnt by Sun's rays, hence oh,
enemy-chasteners, I wish you to lower me down from this mountain..." Thus Sampaati sought for the
help of monkeys.</p>
