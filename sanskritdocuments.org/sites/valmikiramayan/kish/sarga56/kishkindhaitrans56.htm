<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
Monkeys</h3>

<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 56<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Sampaati hears about Jataayu's death when Angada cites it while lamenting for their misfortune. He praises that Jataayu is better off
than the vanara-s for he encountered Ravana and attained martyrdom. On listening his brother's name and news of his death, Sampaati, who firstly
wanted to gluttonise all the vanara-s, seeks their help to lower him down from mountain heights, to listen more of his brother Jataayu.</p>

<p class="comment">Here some translate this as 'I wish to eat the one by one as and when that monkey falls dead, then the next, on its falling
dead...' In such a case, Angada would not have bothered or feared for this eagle, because it wants to vulture upon a cadaver. No need to fear if
death occurs prior to their becoming prey to Sampaati. He feared to become the prey of eagle, whereby their sacred immolation is also going to fail
along with other failures like searching Seetha, transgressing timeframe, hiding in Black Hole etc. Besides, a vulture is the most unpredictable
bird, if it comes to it food.</p>
