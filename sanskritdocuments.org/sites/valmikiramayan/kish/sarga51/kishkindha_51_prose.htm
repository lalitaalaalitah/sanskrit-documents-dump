<h3>Valmiki Ramayana - Kishkindha Kanda in Prose<br>
Sarga 51</h3>

<p class="txt">The legend of Black Cave is informed to Hanuma and others by Swayamprabha, the
sainted lady who safeguards the paradisaical creation of a demon named Maya. Maya crafted this cave
as a heaven on earth, for which the infuriated Indra eliminated Maya. Hema, an apsara,
nymphal-virtuoso accords this fantastic creation to Swayamprabha. Swayamprabha offers hospitality
to all the monkeys who entered that cave.</p>
<br>
 
<p class="verloc">- - - .</p>
<p class="tat"> </p>
<p class="tat">Thus, Hanuma on saying therein that subject, again spoke to that most reverential
and sainted lady who is dressed in black deerskin and conducting herself in probity.</p>
<p class="tat">"Overtired with hunger and thirst we are overawed anywise, and we suddenly entered
this cavity, which is overspread with darkness..." Thus Hanuma is speaking to her, "we entered this
extensive hollow of earth thirstily, but on seeing this kind of these diverse and marvellous
mansions we are verily amazed [presuming that this is a dominion of some demon,] and we are
agitated [in not knowing dos and don'ts,] and agonised [at our incarceration...] whose trees are
all these golden ones, splendent like young sun...</p>
<p class="tat">"The edibles, tubers, and fruits are all depurated... golden are the aircrafts...
mansions silvern... ventilators golden and encased in jewelly laces... Flowered and fruited and
also aromatically scented are these auspicious and completely golden trees... by whose splendour
they are rendered thus?</p>
<p class="tat">"Also how the lotuses born in limpid water are golden, and how the fishes along with
tortoises are ostensibly golden? Or, is all this owing to the innate prodigy of yours or to whose
ascesis' prowess all this is owed... as all of us are oblivious of it, so it will be apt of you to
narrate all of it..." Thus Hanuma requested that sainted lady.</p>
<p class="tat">Thus when Hanuma addressed her, that sainted lady, and a blissful one in the well
being of all the beings, she replied Hanuma.</p>
<p class="tat">"A marvellous fantasist by name Maya was there, a bullish demon of wizardry and by
him with his phenomenal expertise all this golden woodland is constructed..." Thus, that sainted
lady started her narration.</p>
<p class="tat">"Once he was the Universal Craftsman to the lords of demons by whom this divinely
golden and superb mansion was constructed...</p>
<p class="tat">"But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest,
obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, which entails acquirement of entire wealth of Sage
Shukra...</p>
<p class="ItrSloka">Or</p>
<p class="tat">"But he on practising ascesis for thousands of years in this horrendous forest,
obtained a boon from Brahma, the Forefather, which entails acquirement of entire wealth of those
people, who immoderately and avariciously beseech all the available gods, to accord all wealth to
them only...</p>
<p class="comment"> Sage Shukra, better known as Shukraacaarya, is the mentor and
clan-priest of demons. He was an astounding expert to canonise the Architectural Engineering,
creating paradisiacal constructions, materialising materials just from out of thin air and the
like. Likewise, many humans beseech gods near at hand, to bestow wealth as godsend without an iota
of their personal strain, with a confidence that when Shukraacaarya could deliver material comforts
to demons from out of thin air, gods must also be bestowing riches on them, as gods have no other
function than this. Hence, this demon Maya, being a demon, wanted to loot the wealth of his own
demon-priest Shukraacaarya, viz., the Architectural Engineering. And Brahma granted it, as a
crosswise benefit to gods.</p>
<p class="tat">"That dynamic one methodised everything and then resided comfortably in this great
forest for some time, privileged with all his wishes... Indra, the Administrator of Worlds and
destroyer of enemy citadels, on taking His Thunderbolt eliminated Maya, when that eminent demon was
engaged with an apsara, a paradisiacal nymph, called Hema... This marvellous woodland, these
everlasting wish-fulfillers, and this golden mansion, are beneficed by Brahma for Hema...</p>
<p class="tat">"I am the daughter of Merusaavarni, oh, best monkey, named Swayamprabha and I am
safeguarding this mansion of her, that apsara Hema...</p>
<p class="tat">"Hema is a virtuoso in dance and music and my dearest nymphean-friend, and she
bestowed a boon upon me [by which none can dishonour me, and thus] I am safeguarding this superb
mansion...</p>
<p class="comment"> The Universal Architect is given the title of <em>vishva karma</em> and
he will be proficient, right from the skills of a blacksmith to that of an outstanding engineer.
His works are always guided and as directed by Indra. Indra's logic is that there shall be one
<em>vishva karma</em> in all three worlds, like one Indra to three worlds. But whenever Indra lies
low, the demons get works done through the heavenly <em>vishva karma,</em> instead of appointing
their own architect as their clan-priest Shukraacaarya's treasure of architecture is lost. This
treasure of architecture of Shukraacaarya is usurped by this demon Maya, through Brahma. As Indra
cannot defy the boon of Brahma, he baited this Hema, the apsara, to make Maya to woo her.
Accordingly, demon Maya brought the nymphal-virtuoso Hema to this cavernous paradisiacal mansion
and was subjected to elimination by Indra. After the elimination of this Wonder Architect, Hema
departed to Brahma's abode, bequeathing this mansion to Swayamprabha. From then on Hema resided in
<em>brahma loka</em> 'Brahma's abode...' as said at: <em>ghR^itaaciim atha vishvaaciim.... naaga
datam ca hemaam ca...</em> in Ayodhya part II, Ch. 91, verse 17. When Sage Bharadwaja gave
hospitality to Bharata, that sage says this.</p>
<p class="tat">"What is your effort or for what reason you came to pass this impervious forest, and
how you all have discovered this impassable forest...</p>
<p class="tat">"Dine on these wholesome edibles, fruits and tubers, also on drinking soft drinks,
it is apt of you to inform me all about your mission..."</p>
<p class="tat"> Thus Swayamprabha gave hospitality to the monkeys.</p>
