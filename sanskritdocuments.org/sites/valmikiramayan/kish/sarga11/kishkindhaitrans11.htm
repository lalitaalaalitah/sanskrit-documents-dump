Here Vali is said to be following the Vedic custom of <em>sandhyopaasana</em>. Before the wee hours 
of sunrise is <em>brahma muhuurta</em>, at which time water oblations to Ushas are to be offered. Vali 
does not sit on riverside nor on any bund of lake to perform these daily chores, but swings to eastern 
ocean for his daily bath, and from there to southern sea, to make <em>aachamana</em>, sipping water 
for self-purification, and then to western oceans to give <em>arghya</em>, water oblation, and from 
there to other ocean for <em>japa</em> and <em>suuryopasthaana</em>, meditation and welcome to daily 
sun. This same expression Tara, wife of Vali tells Ravana, in <em>uttara kaanDa</em> of Ramayana, when 
Ravana becomes impatient to meet Vali immediately.

Here some translations say that Vali pierced one arrow without using bow in one tree, or in leaves, 
then removing that arrow again pierced, and gone on piercing for many times hurting the trees with many 
holes. While some more translations contain the meaning, taking the clue from <em>niSpatraa kurute</em> 
or <em>niSpatraayitum ghaTate</em> as in verse 67 above, meaning it to be, &#39;aimed arrow and pierced 
the trees and when the arrow exited out of the tree, made its fin-feathers to come out.&#39; In either way, 
&#39;arrow&#39; has no place in monkey&#39;s hands. The very birth of this monkey race is to fight with their nails, 
teeth, and tree-trunks and branches. Hence, the word <em>vivyaadha</em> means that Vali tortures the 
trees by shaking their trunks, and shattering all the leaves in his show of strength.</p>
