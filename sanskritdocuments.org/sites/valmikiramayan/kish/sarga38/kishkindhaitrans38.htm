<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
Monkeys</h3>

<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 38<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><p class="txt">Sugreeva approaches Rama and falls prostrate on Rama's feet as though seeking pardon for the delay. Rama gets him up and mildly
admonishes him. Then Sugreeva while giving the account of legions that are coming in, informs Rama that all the Vanara armies on earth are coming for
confronting Ravana in battle. On asserting that Sugreeva is at his job, Rama is pleased heartily.</p>

like this. The folded and adjoined palms of all the monkeys are looking like lotus buds. While adjoining palms they raised hands over their heads,
where their bodies are appearing similar to the stems of lotuses, and folded palms are like unfolded lotus buds. Rama is gladdened because the lake
called Sugreeva contains these many prayerful devotees who are praying with lotus-bud-like folded palms.</p>

<p class="comment">In the Indian counting system hundred thousands becomes one lakh, [1,00, 000.]
One hundred lakhs become one crore, [10,000,000.] The ancient Indian legionaries have names like
<em>aayuta</em> 'one thousand per unit...' <em>shanku</em> 'one lakh crores...' a trillion -
10<sup>12</sup>. One <em>arbuda</em> 'thousand shanku-s...' <em>madhyama</em> 'ten arbuda-s...'
<em>antam</em> 'ten madhyama-s...' <em>samudra</em> 'twenty antya-s...' <em>paraardha</em> 'thirty
samudra-s...' Rama Tilaka says that by giving these numbers it is to be understood that
'innumerable monkeys are coming...' But others hold the view that the ancients have organised
military pattern hence particular nomenclature is given to each, apart from the generalisation of
Rama Tilaka.</p>
<p class="comment">Govindaraja takes up the enumeration as given in Indian Astrology, which
multiplies ten times each, as said in verse: <p class="comment"><span class="em">ekam dasha shatam
asmaat sahasram ayutam tataH param lakSham | prayutam koTim atha arbudam vR^inde kharvam nikharvam

lakh, <em>prayutam</em> 'ten lakhs or a million, then a crore and then an <em>arbuda</em> ten-crore
or a billion, and then ten arbuda-s makes one <em>bR^inda</em> and ten brinda-s make one
<em>kharva</em> and ten kharva-s make one <em>nikharva</em> and ten nikharva-s make one <em>mahaa
padma</em> and ten mahaa padma-s make one <em>shanku</em> 'one lakh crores or a trillion, and ten
shanku-s make one <em>samudra</em> and then ten samudra-s make one <em>anta</em> and ten anta-s
make a <em>madhyama</em> and ten madhyama-s make one <em>paraardha</em> it may be known thus...</p>
<p class="comment">By this, the nomenclature of million, billion and trillion was there in ancient
days and this may be observed by the names: <em>prayutam</em> 'a million...' <em>arbuda</em> 'a
billion..' and <em>shanku</em> 'a trillion...' and this exactly relates to the decimal system which
is based on the number ten, in which the smaller units are related to the principal units as powers
of ten [units, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.]</p>
