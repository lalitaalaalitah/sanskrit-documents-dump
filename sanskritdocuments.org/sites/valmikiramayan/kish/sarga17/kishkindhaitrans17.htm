<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama&#39;s arrow hits Vali on chest and Vali fallen down. But Vali is not dead yet. When Rama and Lakshmana 
approach dying Vali, he questions the propriety of Rama in killing him. Vali&#39;s questioning explicitly 
is straightforward befitting to the defeated mighty Vanara King. But implicitly, there are ancient commentaries 
that deduce many more meanings in picturising Vali as a devotee of Rama, who wanted to die at the hand 
of Rama, like Viraadha and others, as a means of salvation.</p>

era; such as he is, on seeing that son of Indra, who forsooth has fallen, Rama neared him followed by 
Lakshmana. [4-17-9, 10, 11, 12a]</p>

<p class="comment">
Yayaati is the son of Nahusha, who was a king of repute. After a rigorous penance Yayaati attains heaven. 
But he starts his self-praise and goes on narrating his achievements. Indra tries to tell him that &#39;this 
is heaven, here there is no you-ness and I-ness...&#39; but in vain. Later unable to contend with Yayaati&#39;s 
self-eulogy Indra pushes him back to mortal worlds. Vali is in the same predicament as he took pride 
in his own brawny strength but now battered by still mightier person.</p>

[4-17-16]</p>

<p class="comment">
From hereon the sentences of Vali and also of Rama in next chapter are commented variously and voluminously. 
Apart from upholding Rama&#39;s deed as a rightful one, Vali&#39;s position is also kept up, by deducing meaning 
from these utterances and Vali is pictured as a dedicate to the Absolute. Maheshvara Tiirtha in his
<em>Ramayana tattva diipika</em> gives many tones for these aspects, mainly as innuendo of praise,
<em>vyaaja ninda</em>.</p>

<p class="comment">
In this verse itself Vali&#39;s expression is said to be like this: <em>paraa~Nmukha vadham kR^itvaa =</em> 
&#39;one who is faced way - not in battlefield, but in the battle field like life, say from morality and 
doing all unethical things, like exiling younger brother and captivating his wife... killing of such 
an antagonist is rightful of you...&#39; For another compound <em>kaH atra praaptaH tvayaa guNaH</em> other 
mms use <em>kaH nu praaptaH tvayaa guNaH</em> in that <em>nu</em> has a special usage in Ramayana, as 
at 1-1-2 <em>konvasmin saampratam loke</em> etc. Here also, taking <em>kaH nu guNaH</em> it is said 
that &#39;verily invaluable merit is achieved by you and your godhood is established by absolving me. For 
me, getting killed at your hand is no less a merit, by which I am rid of all sins, and I am now going 
to heavens...&#39; This is supported by scriptures <em>raajatva shaashan paapasyatadaapnoti kilbiSam</em> 
&#39;one who is rightfully punished by the king is rid of all sins&#39;; and according to the saying as well:
<em>raaja bhidhR^ita daNDaastu kR^itvaa paapaani maanavaaH | nirmalaH svargam aayaanti santa sukR^ito 
yathaa</em> and I will go to heavens without blemish&#39;.</p>

<p class="comment">
For the last compound <em>tvat kR^ite nidhanam gataH</em> other mms use <em>shareNa urasi taaditaH</em> 
&#39;with arrow, on chest, struck...&#39; establishing that Rama did not backstab Vali, but hit on chest as 
said at 4-16-35: <em>vaali vakSasi paatitaH</em>.</p>

Explicitly it is Vali&#39;s harsh accusation of Rama, but implicitly it is a praise offered to Rama, since 
his arrow accords heavens to Vali. This is the same with the following two verses. <em>vyaaja ninda</em>

In the verse the two words <em>na, jaane</em> &#39;not known to me&#39; are used only once. While bringing it 
two more times for filling the ellipses, <em>adhyaahaara</em>, meaning is drawn to all three expressions 
as above i.e., &#39;Unknown are the three things... etc.&#39; Vali is said to have admitted that Supreme Soul 
is not a struck-out entity or killable, and either sin or profanity is attachable to Him, as per the 
saying in Bhagavad Gita, <em>kam ghaatayati hanti kam?</em> &#39;who can stab the soul, who hurts it...
<em>na enam chindanti shasraaNi</em> &#39;knife can cleave It not...&#39; as at 2-21 and its successive verses.

The word <em>paapam</em> is either sin or sinner. If it is said as sin, then it is attached to next 
compound then it is read as the admission of Vali in noticing Rama as Supreme Person, <em>paapam pracChannam 
iva paavakam</em> , &#39;as fire will burn the one who is covered with sin, you also will burn...&#39; And there 
is no &#39;garb of dharma...&#39; to you, for you are dharma itself. Thus Vali said to have noticed Supreme 
in Rama, as said at <em>apahata paapmatvaadi guNa vishiSTa</em> &#39;Supreme Person is one who is above 
the words like sins, merits&#39; etc.</p>

This is Vali&#39;s self-assurance that Rama is the Supreme Being, but killed him with some purpose, and 
he would like to know that purpose. In this sequence, Vali assumes that Rama killed him in his search

[4-17-30]</p>

<p class="comment">
The stress of Vali is on his animality. Being a man why killing a monkey unworthy in rituals or in diet, 
is his question. [cf. 38 and 39 verses of this chapter.] Are they just monkeys - is the subsequent question. 
If these Vanara-s were to be a just fruit-eating animals why Vali used to offer <em>sandhya</em> , time-oriented 
oblations to gods as stipulated in Veda-s, in an unusual way of swinging from one ocean to the other. 
And why Tara, who is said to be the knowers of Vedic hymns, as in previous chapter bid <em>swastyayanam</em> 
, bon voyage with Vedic hymns to Vali? This is because of the superiority of vanara race than animals.</p>

<p class="comment">
The other argument of Vali is like this: &#39;We are animals living in forests and unlike elephants, horses 
and the like, we are not even fit to render service to mankind, doing which those animals enjoy high 
grade foods than us, while we are destined to eat fruits and tubers. When there is no rapport between 
you humans and we monkeys, and then there can be no enmity between you and me, because enmity crops 
up only when there is a correlation. Apart from this, I am no equal of yours, but inferior and worthless 
vanara, and hence your killing me is only to give me salvation.&#39; Maheshvara Tiirtha.</p>

Tiger&#39;s skin is used as carpet, its two canine teeth are used in golden necklaces, its other body parts

Rhino&#39;s horn has religious use as well as a decorative article. Caamara, Himalayan-yak&#39;s hair is used 
for royal fanning instruments. Deerskin has its own place in high religious seats of saints and sages. 
Hence the poachers are making a fortune on this fauna. But the skin, bones, or hair of monkey, or to

The king is usually the lord of land. Vishnu is the husband of Earth, <em>bhuu devi</em>. Here Rama 
is both. Here Vali&#39;s contention is, &#39;unlike a husband without rectitude, you will safeguard the land

The girdle-cords, called <em>vaari</em> in Sanskrit foot-cords or girdle cords. The goads of rulebooks 
etc., are required to the humanly elephants that move in herds, break their cords of traditions, cultures 
and social values. The Supreme Being is not so, as said later by himself <em>naiva tasya kR^te na artho</em>

&#39;It is impossible for others to confront me in combat, and for you there is nothing called impossibility.

Thinking that, though I am capable of killing you, and hopefully kill you, do you wish to see a lesser

thus this act of eliminating me cannot be called a killing, but &#39;according salvation&#39; by you the Supreme,

Rama&#39;s approaching Vali for help is an impossible thing. Rama has come all along searching for Sugreeva

<p class="comment">
If Vali is excused, promise given to Sugreeva fails. Ravana is Vali&#39;s friend and even Ravana may come 
running to Rama seeking refuge, and then leaving Ravana without killing, leaves no fruits of incarnation. 
Vali&#39;s logic is that Ravana alone is the evil minded one in abducting Seetha. How about his own action 
in incarcerating Ruma, Sugreeva&#39;s wife? If this is asked Vali might have replied to save his face, &#39;I 
am an animal and those adductions, seductions etc., do not work in our animal kingdom, and we enjoy 
what we want.&#39; But it is not so with Veda practising Vanara-s. Hence this race is given the title of 
Vanara, neither animal, nor monkey, nor human.</p>
