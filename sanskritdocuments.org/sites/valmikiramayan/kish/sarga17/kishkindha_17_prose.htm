<p class="txt">
Rama&#39;s arrow hits Vali on chest and Vali fallen down. But Vali is not dead yet. When Rama and Lakshmana 
approach dying Vali, he questions the propriety of Rama in killing him. Vali&#39;s questioning explicitly 
is straightforward befitting to the defeated mighty Vanara King. But implicitly, there are ancient commentaries 
that deduce many more meanings in picturising Vali as a devotee of Rama, who wanted to die at the hand 
of Rama, like Viraadha and others, as a means of salvation.</p>

<br>

<p class="verloc">

<p class="tat">
</p>

<p class="tat">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">
When Rama&#39;s arrow hit him then Vali, the scourger in war, suddenly fell down like a hewed down tree. 
He who glittered with pure golden ornaments, that Vali fell down on earth while all of his limbs sank 
to dust, like the flag of Indra when released from its ropes. On the fall of that lord of hosts of monkeys 
and bears onto earth, unilluminated is the earth like the welkin that has forsooth lost its moon.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Though that great souled Vali fell onto earth, neither his brilliance, nor lives, nor resplendence, 
nor his bravery are unfettering from his body. That superb and gem-studded golden pendent given by Indra 
sustained that monkey chief&#39;s lives, resplendence and brilliance. By still wearing that golden chest-pendant 
around his neck, that brave general of monkeys Vali appeared like a black-cloud smeared with the colour 
of golden sunset all around its edges.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Even though Vali has fallen on ground his splendour is as though refulgent devising itself into three 
aspects, namely by his body, chest-pendant, and the arrow of Rama, which arrow is given to strike the 
crucial body parts alone, and which is still stuck in Vali&#39;s chest. That arrow which effectuates the 
pathway to heaven, now discharged from the bow of Rama has brought forth that redemption to brave Vali 
.
</p>

<p class="tat">
Then on seeing him who has fallen in war, the one with golden pendant, enormously chested, mightily 
armed, face golden, eye greenish, but who is like a fire extinct of its flame; who is like Indra in 
unassailability and like Upendra in indomitability; and who like Yayaati who has fallen from heaven, 
as well like the sun who falls onto earth from solar orbit when Time-ender flings him at the end of 
era; such as he is, on seeing that son of Indra, who forsooth has fallen, Rama neared him followed by 
Lakshmana.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Yayaati is the son of Nahusha, who was a king of repute. After a rigorous penance Yayaati attains heaven. 
But he starts his self-praise and goes on narrating his achievements. Indra tries to tell him that &#39;this 
is heaven, here there is no you-ness and I-ness...&#39; but in vain. Later unable to contend with Yayaati&#39;s 
self-eulogy Indra pushes him back to mortal worlds. Vali is in the same predicament as he took pride 
in his own brawny strength but now battered by still mightier person.</p>

<p class="tat">
On seeing the brave Vali fallen like that, who by now is like fire with extinguished tongues of flames, 
and who is seeing droopily, those two valiant brothers, Rama and Lakshmana, neared him with due honour.
</p>

<p class="tat">
On seeing Rama and the great mighty Lakshmana as well, he who fell to ground flatly hurt by arrow, and 
whose energy and lives are trifling and vigour trivialised thereby, that Vali spoke these sarcastic 
words in his proper pride to Rama, who is taking pride in this conflict as a victor, which words at 
the same time have meaning, politeness, and self-righteousness.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;You are a renowned prince with pleasing looks… but, which kind of death I am getting now, that too 
when I was in the commotion of conflict with another, alas, that ignoble death is owing to you, and 
what merit is achieved by you in this undertaking of yours to kill someone who is facing away from you…
</p>

<p class="comment">
From hereon the sentences of Vali and also of Rama in next chapter are commented variously and voluminously. 
Apart from upholding Rama&#39;s deed as a rightful one, Vali&#39;s position is also kept up, by deducing meaning 
from these utterances and Vali is pictured as a dedicate to the Absolute. Maheshvara Tiirtha in his
<em>Ramayana tattva diipika</em> gives many tones for these aspects, mainly as innuendo of praise,
<em>vyaaja ninda</em>.</p>

<p class="comment">
In this verse itself Vali&#39;s expression is said to be like this: <em>paraa~Nmukha vadham kR^itvaa =</em> 
&#39;one who is faced way - not in battlefield, but in the battle field like life, say from morality and 
doing all unethical things, like exiling younger brother and captivating his wife... killing of such 
an antagonist is rightful of you...&#39; For another compound <em>kaH atra praaptaH tvayaa guNaH</em> other 
mms use <em>kaH nu praaptaH tvayaa guNaH</em> in that <em>nu</em> has a special usage in Ramayana, as 
at 1-1-2 <em>konvasmin saampratam loke</em> etc. Here also, taking <em>kaH nu guNaH</em> it is said 
that &#39;verily invaluable merit is achieved by you and your godhood is established by absolving me. For 
me, getting killed at your hand is no less a merit, by which I am rid of all sins, and I am now going 
to heavens...&#39; This is supported by scriptures <em>raajatva shaashan paapasyatadaapnoti kilbiSam</em> 
&#39;one who is rightfully punished by the king is rid of all sins&#39;; and according to the saying as well:
<em>raaja bhidhR^ita daNDaastu kR^itvaa paapaani maanavaaH | nirmalaH svargam aayaanti santa sukR^ito 
yathaa</em> and I will go to heavens without blemish&#39;.</p>

<p class="comment">
For the last compound <em>tvat kR^ite nidhanam gataH</em> other mms use <em>shareNa urasi taaditaH</em> 
&#39;with arrow, on chest, struck...&#39; establishing that Rama did not backstab Vali, but hit on chest as 
said at 4-16-35: <em>vaali vakSasi paatitaH</em> .</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Rama is high-born, they say, gifted with mightiness, resplendent, pursuer of vows, mindful of mercy, 
delighter in people&#39;s welfare, sympathetic, greatly enthusiastic and assertively committed in doing 
good deeds, knower of time-and-action, all these living-beings on earth are thus relating your renown, 
aren&#39;t they.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Explicitly it is Vali&#39;s harsh accusation of Rama, but implicitly it is a praise offered to Rama, since 
his arrow accords heavens to Vali. This is the same with the following two verses. <em>vyaaja ninda</em> 
innuendo of praise.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;To be able to control senses and will, forgiveness, conscientiousness, resoluteness, truthfulness, 
and adventurousness, oh, king, are the aptitudes of a king, and even punishing the wrongdoers, too. 
Concluding that those kingly characteristics will be obtainable in you, and even judging by the noble 
dynasty of yours, I have confronted Sugreeva though Tara dissuaded me.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When you have not appeared before me when I confronted Sugreeva my concept was, &#39;it will be inapt of 
Rama to hurt me while I am combating with another combatant, besides, when I will be unvigilant in that 
fight… Not known that your soul is put to death, not known that you are the unrighteous flag bearer 
of righteousness, to me not known that you are insidious like straw covered well.
</p>

<p class="comment">
In the verse the two words <em>na, jaane</em> &#39;not known to me&#39; are used only once. While bringing it 
two more times for filling the ellipses, <em>adhyaahaara</em>, meaning is drawn to all three expressions 
as above i.e., &#39;Unknown are the three things... etc.&#39; Vali is said to have admitted that Supreme Soul 
is not a struck-out entity or killable, and either sin or profanity is attachable to Him, as per the 
saying in Bhagavad Gita, <em>kam ghaatayati hanti kam?</em> &#39;who can stab the soul, who hurts it...
<em>na enam chindanti shasraaNi</em> &#39;knife can cleave It not...&#39; as at 2-21 and its successive verses. 
Here Vali has said that &#39;nobody knows, including me... that you are flag-bearer of virtue above individual 
souls, sins...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;I have no knowledge that you are a sinner, one in the garb of a benign soul, and explicitly mantled 
under the garb of probity like ash covered fire.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>paapam</em> is either sin or sinner. If it is said as sin, then it is attached to next 
compound then it is read as the admission of Vali in noticing Rama as Supreme Person, <em>paapam pracChannam 
iva paavakam</em> , &#39;as fire will burn the one who is covered with sin, you also will burn...&#39; And there 
is no &#39;garb of dharma...&#39; to you, for you are dharma itself. Thus Vali said to have noticed Supreme 
in Rama, as said at <em>apahata paapmatvaadi guNa vishiSTa</em> &#39;Supreme Person is one who is above 
the words like sins, merits&#39; etc.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;I am non-guilty as I have not committed any misdeed either in your country or in your city, nor I have 
taunted you; I am a vanara subsisting on fruits and tubers and always moving in forests alone; such 
as I am, what made you to torture me when I was not combating with you en face, furthermore, when I 
was involved with another?
</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;You do not kill any guiltless beings, <em>tvam api a+kilbiSam na himsi</em> , but you are now killing 
me because there is some guilt in my deeds, of which I am well aware, but waited for you to come...&#39; 
This is the subtext of Vali&#39;s retrospection.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;You are renowned to be a prince with charming looks, oh, king, and indications agreeable to rectitude 
are also appearing on your body. Will anybody born in Kshatriya&#39;s family, a learned one in Veda-s, thereby 
who is rid of ambiguities with respect to right and wrong, and who is cloaked in an air of probity, 
execute such a ruthless deed like this? Though born in Raghava&#39;s dynasty and renowned as a moralist 
you are actually amoral, and for what purpose you run around with this moral aspect?
</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;Oh, Rama, you took birth, not so, emerged as an incarnation in Raghava&#39;s dynasty, <em>artham</em> purposefully...
<em>abhavya san</em> &#39;though cruel...&#39; <em>bhavya ruupeNa paridhaavasi, kim?</em> you are moving about 
with a superficial aspect of a morally sagacious person, or what? No definitely. <em>kruura karma samaacaret?</em> 
or did you do a wrongdoing in killing me? Not so.</p>

<p class="comment">
If it is said that you are an incarnate on earth, there cannot be duality in your inner aspect or outer 
aspect. You cannot have a cruel heart with a charming face of a prine, when you alone are the protector 
of Universe. Equally, taking birth in Raghava-s lineage you cannot move about with a sagely appearance 
and go on killing beings like me. So, there shall be some purpose in killing me. <em>artham kim</em> 
&#39;what is that purpose...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
This is Vali&#39;s self-assurance that Rama is the Supreme Being, but killed him with some purpose, and 
he would like to know that purpose. In this sequence, Vali assumes that Rama killed him in his search 
for Seetha, and thus Vali tells Rama &#39;if that is the only reason I would have brought Seetha in one 
day without any bloodshed…&#39; The purpose for Vali&#39;s elimination is nothing but the elimination of Ravana.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Influencing, largesse, forbearance, probity, candour, and conquering are the attributes of the kings, 
oh, king, and even punishing the wrongdoers.</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;The first said political strategies <em>saama, daana, bheda</em>, may not work with me because I am 
not a coequal of yours in kingship, so the last one, <em>daNda</em>, &#39;punishing the wrongdoer,&#39; is enough 
to eliminate me, for I must have committed wrongs.&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;We as animals live in forests while you are city dwellers, we live by eating fruits and tubers while 
you enjoy feasts and banquets, our nature is such to kill and get killed, thus you and me have no correlation. 
And you, even if you are a man and a prince for humans, you resorted to this animalistic way of killing 
me lying in the wait, thus your action is worse than that of an animal, if not subhuman or un-princely.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The stress of Vali is on his animality. Being a man why killing a monkey unworthy in rituals or in diet, 
is his question. [cf. 38 and 39 verses of this chapter.] Are they just monkeys - is the subsequent question. 
If these Vanara-s were to be a just fruit-eating animals why Vali used to offer <em>sandhya</em> , time-oriented 
oblations to gods as stipulated in Veda-s, in an unusual way of swinging from one ocean to the other. 
And why Tara, who is said to be the knowers of Vedic hymns, as in previous chapter bid <em>swastyayanam</em> 
, bon voyage with Vedic hymns to Vali? This is because of the superiority of vanara race than animals.</p>

<p class="comment">
The other argument of Vali is like this: &#39;We are animals living in forests and unlike elephants, horses 
and the like, we are not even fit to render service to mankind, doing which those animals enjoy high 
grade foods than us, while we are destined to eat fruits and tubers. When there is no rapport between 
you humans and we monkeys, and then there can be no enmity between you and me, because enmity crops 
up only when there is a correlation. Apart from this, I am no equal of yours, but inferior and worthless 
vanara, and hence your killing me is only to give me salvation.&#39; Maheshvara Tiirtha.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Territory, gold, and silver will be the causes while counteracting somebody, in that case, by what 
you are decoyed into these forests of mine or in the fruits of mine.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The statements of &#39;my forests... my fruits...&#39; will be retorted by Rama in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;In the pairs of propriety and compliance, punishment and pardoning, no admixture is exercised in kingcraft, 
for the kings do not conduct themselves volitionally.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Vali&#39;s statement is: &#39;Even the ordinary rulers on earth do not conduct themselves without adhering to 
their codes of conduct, then what is there to speak of you who is the Ruler of Universe. So, you must 
have imposed this punishment without mixing the pairs of opposites that results in my salvation...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;But, to you your self-interests are primary, and you are a wrathful, capricious, contriver of kingcraft, 
and an impetuous shooting-happy archer. Oh, king, you have no devotion to probity, nor your mind is 
firm about material gains, but as a free-willed one you are distracted by senses.
</p>

<p class="comment">
&quot;The &#39;Lord of People&#39; is the Supreme Person incarnated himself as a king of humans as per the derivation 
of the word <em>naaraayaNa</em> , one who conducts humans to and fro from him. <em>tvam</em> &#39;you...&#39; 
; Here the <em>tu</em> is as in verse at 4-17-33, i.e., <em>kim ardhaka, kim</em> Are you? ; So, <em>
tvam kaama pradhaanaH</em> &#39;you are the primary one to humans to aspire for. While all the created beings 
aspire one thing or the other, humans have many more wants. But above all these human wants, you are 
the primary-want to be desired or aspired for salvation.&#39; <em>avaapta samasta kaamanaH</em> &#39;you do 
not have any aspiration or desire for yourself...&#39; <em>kopanaH</em> &#39; in punishing the wrongdoers you 
are a wrathful one...&#39; <em>anavasthitaH</em> &#39;unstable, ever-moving, dynamic in maintaining universe. 
&#39; <em>raaja vR^ittaiH ca samkiirNaH</em> is read otherwise as <em>raaja vR^itteSu samkiirNaH</em> &#39;concocted 
is your kingly orientation, for you wear cloths like a saint and yet handle weaponry, whereas in actuality 
there no garb for you.&#39; The first compound in 4-17-34 is read as <em>te dharme apacitiH na</em> &#39;you 
have no sincerity in ordinary scripture-laid virtues...&#39; and then it is said, &#39;scriptures and canons 
are for ordinary humans but you are above them... so you are beyond the ordinary canons that emerged 
for humans&#39; <em>kaama vR^itte san</em> &#39; you are independent in your deeds or movements...&#39; <em>indriyaiH 
kR^iSyase, kim?</em> &#39;are you drawn away by senses, or what? No. You cannot be drawn away by the horses 
called senses for you are the holder of their reins. So you are the <em>jana iishvara</em> Supreme Lord 
for the people, as king of people, or as the Supreme Person who took incarnation as Rama.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;How you are answerable to gentlemen, Rama, when you have done this detestable deed of killing an unoffending 
one like me with your arrow?
</p>

<p class="comment">
Since this killing of Vali is an intricate act, some may point out that Rama is at fault in killing 
Vali. But Vali states here inversely that, &quot;you may inform gentlemen who may point out that this act 
of yours in killing me is a wrongdoing... you may say them that &#39;I have killed a wrongdoer so I am not 
at fault...&#39; &quot; Vali has no need to say repeatedly that he is killed by the arrow of Rama, as he is not 
killed by a sword or cudgel. But, it is to be repeated necessarily to remind that the arrow came from 
an unknown destination.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;A regicide, a Brahman-cide, a cow-slayer, a thief, an inveterate killer, an atheist, and an younger 
brother who marries before his elder, all of them will go to hell. A slander-monger, skinflint, friend-killer 
and one who makes love with his teacher&#39;s wife, they all go to the worlds of evil-souls, no doubt about 
it.
</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;My skin is unwearable, holy people forbid my hair and bones, and uneatable is my meat for your kind 
of reputable people.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Tiger&#39;s skin is used as carpet, its two canine teeth are used in golden necklaces, its other body parts 
are said to contain medicinal properties, and hence the numbers of tigers are dwindling, especially 
in India. Elephant&#39;s tusks are great decorative articles. Camel&#39;s bones are made into bangles and bracelets. 
Rhino&#39;s horn has religious use as well as a decorative article. Caamara, Himalayan-yak&#39;s hair is used 
for royal fanning instruments. Deerskin has its own place in high religious seats of saints and sages. 
Hence the poachers are making a fortune on this fauna. But the skin, bones, or hair of monkey, or to 
that matter of fact any item of a monkey is not of any use either in religious or in medicinal or for 
decorative purposes. Hence, they are not killed for food, game or poaching.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Raghava, five kinds of five-nailed animals, viz., a kind of wild rodent, a kind of wild-boar, a kind 
of lizard, a hare and fifthly the turtle are edible for Brahmans and Kshatriya-s. Sensible people will 
not touch my skin and bones, oh, king, nor meats from my body are to be eaten, such as I am, a five-nailed 
animal, I am killed.
</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;There appears to be no reason as to why a five-nailed animal like me is to be killed, when there is 
no reason for political, religious, hunting, or food purposes. Then this act of yours shall have an 
ultimate purpose isn&#39;t it…&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Though Tara appraised me with truthful and favourable words, I just disregarded her advise owing to 
my own delusion, and gone into the control of Time.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Though dissuaded by Tara, <em>kaalasya vasham aagataH, satyam</em>; I am bound to come here for my time 
is over and I am destined to die at the hands of the Supreme Being. Or, to say clearly <em>iishvarasya 
vasham aagataH, satyam</em> &#39;I have come under the control Supreme, truly...&#39; where <em>kaalaH</em>, 
Time, is another name for Supreme Being; <em>kaalo asmi loka kshaya kR^it pravaddhaH... kala </em>

&quot;With you as her espouser the Earth is not with a correct spouse, as with any lady who is with full-fledged 
chastity, but with a husband who is without rectitude.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The king is usually the lord of land. Vishnu is the husband of Earth, <em>bhuu devi</em>. Here Rama 
is both. Here Vali&#39;s contention is, &#39;unlike a husband without rectitude, you will safeguard the land 
truthfully as you have all the attributes of a lord of land and a good husband. <em>duSTa nigrahatvaadi 
kalyaaNa guNa ruupeNa</em>. So, you will protect Earth by eradicating evildoers on it... like me...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;How are you borne to that great-souled Dasharatha when you are artful, felonious, knavish, disposed 
to a false modesty subconsciously, and an evildoer?</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;You are born to great-souled Dasharatha, <em>yato mahaatmanaa dasharathena jaataH... katham shaThaH?</em> 
&#39;being the son of such a great-soul Dasharatha, how can you be artful, felonious?</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;I am killed by an elephant called Rama that snapped off its girdle-cord called tradition, that infringed 
the conventions of righteous people, and that discarded the goad called virtue.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The girdle-cords, called <em>vaari</em> in Sanskrit foot-cords or girdle cords. The goads of rulebooks 
etc., are required to the humanly elephants that move in herds, break their cords of traditions, cultures 
and social values. The Supreme Being is not so, as said later by himself <em>naiva tasya kR^te na artho</em> 
in Bhagavad Gita at 3-18 and also at <em>saMkarsaya ca kartaaa syaam</em> 3-24. &#39;So getting eliminated 
from this mortality by no less than the Supreme Being is my fortune.&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;On accomplishing this sort of unpropitious, unjustified killing, which is condemned by the righteous 
people, what can you say when you meet the godly men?
</p>

<p class="comment">
Vali is saying in <em>vyaaja ninda</em> praise in innuendo. Taking the last word Vali is prompting Rama 
to say like this: <em>samaagataH</em> is cleaved as <em>saH maagataH, maam gataH</em> &#39;he, that Vali, 
Me, reached...&#39; Vali attained salvation and reached Me. <em>a+shubham ca a+yuktam ca api san, maam gataH</em> 
&#39;Though Vali&#39;s actions are unpropitious, unjustified and condemnable by the righteous, but by Me eliminated 
he attained Me, the Supreme Being...&#39; And this agrees with <em>mR^ityuH sarva haraH ca aham</em> Gita 
- 10-34 &#39;I am the death, an all- exhausting-one.&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;The valour that which is displayed on the unprejudiced few like us, oh, Rama, I do not see that sort 
of valour is shown by you in respect of your enemies.
</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>vikrama</em> is triumphing, and treading as well. Taking the meaning of Rama&#39;s treading 
up to Vali it is said as below. <em>apakaariSu</em> &#39;perpetrating evil on your dedicates like Sugreeva, 
Hanuma et al&#39; ; <em>asmaasu</em> &#39;on us, myself, Tara, and Angada&#39; <em>te</em> your <em>yaH</em> &#39;those 
feet, that are impossible to be seen by Brahma and others; <em>vi krama</em> valour / treading; <em>
pradarshitaH udaasiinesu</em> that are displayed, to great-souls and saints; <em>na pashyaami</em> hitherto 
I have not seen.</p>

<p class="comment">
You have shown mercy on us namely myself, Tara, Angada and other adherents of mine, though we have perpetrated 
evil in respect of your adherents like Sugreeva, Hanuma et al. You have shown mercy by way of your treading 
towards me on your divine feet, which feet will not be revealed even to Brahma, but at times you reveal 
them to sages and saints. I have seen them now. Had I seen these Divine Feet earlier, I would have suddenly 
fallen on them long back, like Sugreeva. But, I do not foresee advancement of the same feet towards 
the real wrongdoers, namely Ravana, Kumbhakarna and Indrajit, as yet.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Had you been in combat with me en face oh, prince, you would have been killed by me and by now you 
would have seen the death-god Yama.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama might have cut a sorry face for he did not confront Vali vis-à-vis on field, but shot his arrow 
from afar. Vali says for this, &#39;it is impossible for others to confront me... but to you nothing is 
impossible... and you might have confronted me.&#39; Here the word <em>yadi</em> is used in sense <em>kim 
arthaka</em> i.e., &#39;or what?&#39; <em>adya mayaa dR^ishyamaanaa san, yuddhyethaa api</em> &#39;today even if 
you fight with me manifestly, that too before me... <em>mayaa hataH san, vaivasvata devam pasheH, kim?</em> 
&#39;by me killed though, do you see Yama, Death-god, or what?</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;It is impossible for others to confront me in combat, and for you there is nothing called impossibility. 
Other way round, though you confront me in person can I fight you back? Can I kill an unkillable entity? 
Thinking that, though I am capable of killing you, and hopefully kill you, do you wish to see a lesser 
god like Yama in <em>naraka</em> the Hell. Improbable and impossible are all these suppositions, and 
thus this act of eliminating me cannot be called a killing, but &#39;according salvation&#39; by you the Supreme, 
in person.&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;An unassailable one, such as I am, I am killed by you while you remained invisible on the field of 
fight, as with a sinner bitten by a snake while he is asleep.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Vali is said to be lamenting to have lost his chance to confront Rama face to face in fight. The word
<em>paapavasham gato aham</em> is read as <em>paana vasham gato aham</em> in other mms. Meaning that 
&#39;a drunken man bitten by snake&#39; and this drunkenness is attributed to Vali and said as:</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;In my own drunkenness of unassailable might, I could not see and confront you in fight, and had I been 
sober, though dead at your hands, I would have been victorious in going to heavens...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Secondly, it is not Rama that has not shown himself up, it is Vali who did not try to find where Rama 
is. Rama is aware of the boon given by Brahma to Vali

Summoning Vali, Brahma gave an unexcelling boon... any combatant confronting Vali will loose half of 
his strength to Vali...</p>

<p class="comment">
Knowing this through Sugreeva, and honouring Brahma&#39;s boon Rama did not come face to face with Vali. 
This is said at 4-16-27, and 4-16-31. The same is the situation when Hanuma is bound by Brahma missile 
in Sundara Kanda, where he obliges Brahma&#39;s decree.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;For which purpose I am killed, intending to do good to Sugreeva is incidental to it, you should have 
assigned me for that purpose in the first instance itself, and I would have brought that evil-minded 
demon Ravana, the abductor of your wife in one day, that too without killing him in any fight, but by 
fastening him by neck, and I would have presented Maithili to you.

<p class="comment">
Rama&#39;s approaching Vali for help is an impossible thing. Rama has come all along searching for Sugreeva 
and befriended him. Also given is the word to Sugreeva to kill Vali. Rama&#39;s going back on his own word 
can never happen. puts it as: <font face="Translit 98" size="3em" color="#B3003A">

If Vali is excused, promise given to Sugreeva fails. Ravana is Vali&#39;s friend and even Ravana may come 
running to Rama seeking refuge, and then leaving Ravana without killing, leaves no fruits of incarnation. 
Vali&#39;s logic is that Ravana alone is the evil minded one in abducting Seetha. How about his own action 
in incarcerating Ruma, Sugreeva&#39;s wife? If this is asked Vali might have replied to save his face, &#39;I 
am an animal and those adductions, seductions etc., do not work in our animal kingdom, and we enjoy 
what we want.&#39; But it is not so with Veda practising Vanara-s. Hence this race is given the title of 
Vanara, neither animal, nor monkey, nor human.</p>

&quot;I would have brought Maithili at your order even if she is lodged in oceanic waters or in nether worlds, 
as with the White Horse of Vedic lore.
</p>

<p class="comment">
There is one Upanishad called <em>shveta ashvatara</em> Upanishad and when it was in the shape of white 
female horse, this horse was stolen by Madhu and Kaitabha demon-brothers and later retrieved by Hayagreeva, 
another aspect of Vishnu.</p>

&quot;The fact of Sugreeva&#39;s getting the kingdom after my going to heaven is proper, but the fact of your 
killing me in war, unrighteously, is improper.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Why Vali banished Sugreeva from kingdom is being explained. <em>a + dharmeNa</em> &#39; un-righteously ...&#39;; 
by the unjust deed of Sugreeva&#39;s closing the face of cave when I was fighting with Dundubhi, wishful 
of my death and thus; <em>sugriivaH raajyam praapnuyaat iti yat tat a + yuktam</em> &#39; Sugreeva&#39;s getting 
this kingdom unrighteously, is improper.&#39; <em>aham tvayaa raNe nihataH itaH param mayi svar gatena ata 
sugriivo raajyam raajyam praapnuyaat iti yat tat yukatam</em> &#39; on my going to heavens his getting the 
kingdom is proper.&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;As long as I am alive Sugreeva can never get a chance to rule the kingdom, because he ascended throne 
improperly and unrighteously when I am alive in the cave. Because he closed the entrance of the cave, 
wishing me to die therein, when I was still fighting with Dundubhi, I had to banish him. Now that I 
am going to heaven at your mercy, his getting the throne of Kishkindha at your mercy, and as its one 
time regent, is proper.&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Admittedly the world is this way, and if possible a relevant reply may gently be thought ofabout your 
propriety in killing me...&quot; So said Vali to Rama.
</p>

<p class="comment">
For the above the latent meaning of Vali is: <em>lokaH</em> &#39; people, living beings...&#39;; <em>evam vidhaH 
cet</em> &#39; like me sinners, if they become...&#39;; <em>kaamam kaalena viyujyate</em> &#39; desirably by Time, 
Yama, people will be disposed&#39;; <em>bhavataa praaptam uttaram</em> &#39;from you, received, reply - in the 
shape of killing me; <em>uttamam</em> &#39; the best&#39;; <em>kshamam</em> &#39; proper one&#39;; <em>cintyataam</em> 
&#39;you shall think that way only&#39;;</p>

<p class="comment">
If people become sinners like me, Time, Yama disposes them off desirably, and the reply for my sins 
received from you in the shape of your arrow in my chest, is the best and a proper one too, so it shall 
be thought of, not otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p class="tat">
That great-souled son of a vanara king Vali, whom the arrow impaled and agonised, on keenly seeing Rama 
whose resplendence equals the brightness of the sun, said that much and remained silent when his mouth 
has dried up.
</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama has not used any great or deadly arrow on Vali, but a third rated or lesser one is shot at, because 
Vali is still lingering with the same arrow in his chest. The same is said in Yuddha kanda, 67th chapter, 
154 verse, where Valmiki himself is amazed to say that Kumbhakarna is not killable with that sort of 
arrow which pierced through seven great sala trees, and which has killed the greatest Vali. <em>yaiH 
saayakaiH saala varaa nikR^ittaa, vaalii hato vaanara pu~NgavaH ca...</em> and narrating thus the poet 
says that Vali is nothing when compared with Kumbhakarna and others in Lanka.</p>

Killing Vali - the riddle</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4" class="comment">Vali&#39;s killing is a puzzle from the viewpoint of imperial politics 
and dharma. Hence Vali questions logically about it, even at his dying stage. The questions are as below:</font></p>

1] By killing one who is facing away, what worth is achieved by 
you?; 2] You have not punished the wrongdoer; 3] Killed one who is combating with another and an unvigilant 
one; 4] In your country or city I did no misdeed; 5] Non-guilty being is hurt; 6] Fruits, tuber eating 
being is killed; 7] No dispute of land, gold or silver; 8] You primary aspiration is to kill without 
probing into good or bad; 9] How do you face criticism by scholars?; 10] Unnecessary killers are hell-goers; 
11] Un-wearable is my skin uneatable is my flesh; 12] Five kinds of five-nailed animals are usable by 
humans; 13] I would have brought back Maithili in one day.</p>

<p class="comment">For all these questions Rama answers in next chapter and speaks 
as to how justified is this elimination, to Vali and to all of us.</p>
