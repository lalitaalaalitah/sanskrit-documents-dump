<h3>
TRIBUTE TO T.V. KAPALI SHASTRI AND M.P. PANDIT</h3></b></center>
<UL><UL>
<A name=kapali>
<P>
SHRI T.V. KAPALI SHASTRI
<P>
T.V. Kapali Shastri was a teacher, translator, exegisist, essayist,
philosopher, and a great sadhaka in the path of   yoga   and Tantra. He has
left an indelible mark on those who encountered him as friends, fellowseekers,
or disciples who have recorded his nobility and love in their writings. He
has penned down what he learnt and experienced under the auspices of his
three gurus viz., Vasishta Ganapati Muni, Ramana Maharshi and Sri Aurobindo
in his versatile writings, which act as a perfect guide for seekers of
spiritual knowledge.
<P>
He was born in a traditional Vedic family belonging to Samaveda   in the year
1886 at Mylapore in Tamil Nadu. He learnt from his father Shri Vishveshvara
Shastri passed on recitation of Saman mantras in his early years and the
Upanishads and Shrividya to him. Kapali Shastri mastered other branches of
traditional learning like Kavya, Shastra and different branches of philosophy
in a traditional way along with his general education in School. His flair
for learning languages gave him mastery over several languages like Sanskrit,
English, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. He was a versatile writer in all these
languages and his writings are held in high esteem.
<P>
Kapali Shastri's literary genius can be found in various forms of writing
like essays, commentaries, philosophical treatises, poetry and so on. He
was a practicing yogi, a philosopher attuned to Tantra. Kapali Shastri
has written a large  number  of works  related to the  Vedas, Upanishads
and Darshanas in Sanskrit, English, Tamil and Telugu languages which have
enriched the knowledge contained in  our ancient scriptures with the light
of  his intuitive experience.
<P>
Kapali Shastri encountered his first Guru, Vasishta Ganapati Muni in his
early twenties, and became his disciple instantly. He was initiated into
the inner meaning of the Vedic Gods and indepth experiential knowledge of
Tantra Shastra from him. He pays tribute to his Guru in his Introduction,
bhashyabhumika of Siddhanjana: ``....  it was the late Kavyakantha Vasishta
Ganapati Muni, whom we adored and addressed as Nayana  beloved father  who in
a way first opened my eyes. It was he who since 1907 took me as his own and
guided me in many branches of Sanskrit study and laid in me the foundations
for spiritual life that in later years grew to claim me in its entirety. It
was in 1910 that he favored me with instructions regarding the deities of
the Rigveda and the depth of thought in the   Vedic hymns.''
<P>
Kapali Shastri was drawn closer to Ramana Maharshi being a student of
Ganapati Muni. Maharshi accepted him as his disciple and used to call him
`Chnnayana'  'little boy' affectionately. (Ganapati Muni was called as
``nayana' by Ramana Maharshi. Literal meaning of nayana is father but it is
used to address younger persons affectionately).
<P>
Kapali Shastri's knowledge of astronomy, astrology, grammar, logic,
Mantrashastra, Ayurveda and Vedanta along with his command over four
languages coupled with the power of intuition, which he had developed
through his yogic sadhana, stimulated him towards writing commentaries on
contemporary scriptures. His commentaries on all the important works of his
three Gurus, Ganapati Muni, Ramana Maharshi, and Sri Aurobindo are held in high
esteem. His commentary, Prabha on the great work of Vasishtha Ganapati Muni
viz., Umasahasram depicts his poetic genius as well as his spiritual sadhana.
<P>
His quest for spiritual attunement brought him closer to Sri Aurobindo in
his early forties. He became a permanent resident of Aurobindo Ashram in
Pondicherry from the year 1929. He found answers to all his inner queries
in the Aurobindonean Philosophy and travelled in the same path of yoga to
follow the synthesis of the Vedic thoughts. (Reference  4, Collected works
of Kapali Shastri, Vol II)
<P>
Kapali Shastri's commentary on the first ashtaka of Rigveda in Sanskrit
called `Siddhanjana' is a monumental work. This remains until today the only
spiritual commentary written for all the 121 suktas in the first ashtaka of
Rigveda Samhita in Sanskrit language.
<P>
Kapali Shastri was gifted with the natural flow in his translations. Shri
M.P. Pandit, who was very close associate of Shri Kapali Shastri in Sri
Aurobindo Ashram, has published eleven volumes titled ``Collected Works of
Kapali Shastri in which he has recorded many personal experiences with this
literary genius. He has wondered about the easy flow of thought and action
of Kapali Shastri while writing either poetry or an essay.
<A name=pandit>
<P>
SHRI M.P. PANDIT
<P>
Shri M.P. Pandit was a member of Shri Aurobindo Ashram for over fifty
 years. He has authored more than a hundred books on various subjects and
 aspects of spiritual life. He was sought internationally as an inspired
 speaker with a global perspective. He has written and spoken extensively
 on the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavadgita, Tantra, Occultism, Psychology,
 and Yoga, in the light of Sri Aurobindo's integral approach. He had a
 remarkable synthesis of knowledge.
<P>
Shri Pandit was the Secretary of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Chairman of World
 Union International, and editor of  ``The  Advent'',  ``World Union'' and the
 ``Service Letter''. He has published a number of works of different scholars
 on Sri Aurobindo's philosophy and insight into the Vedas. His translation
 of one hundred verses of Umasahasram into English based on the commentary
 of Kapali Shastri is a remarkable work. He has done a great service to the
 spiritual aspirants by publishing all his works in eleven volumes titled
 ``Collected Works of Kapali Shastri.
<A name=ganapati>
<P>
GANAPATI MUNI AND HIS INFLUENCE
<P>
Shri Vasishta Ganapati Muni was firm believers of Vedic culture, where
freedom of thought, action, and equality in society were not only preached,
but were also practiced. He used to throw challenges to prove the basis for
untouchability in the Vedas and used to speak in favor of emancipation of
lower strata of our society in religious circles. Kapali Shastri has written
a biography of Ganapati Muni in Sanskrit called 'Vasishta Vaibhavam', which
depicts his superior, gift of   literary and philosophical and spiritual
expositions. Ganapati Muni learnt the secrets of tapas in the feet of Ramana
Maharshi and developed the inner vision of Veda Mantras.
<P>
Vasishta Ganapati Muni was a Master of Dasha Mahavidyas. His philosophy
and spiritualties were firmly attuned to Tantra. He participated in many
discourses to uphold Vedic culture where harmony in society was maintained
and the inhuman practice of untouchability was unheard of. He was conferred
with the title as `Muni' in recognition of a major role played by him in the
eradication of such practices in society. Ganapati Muni was also a great
patriot and has composed one thousand verses that depict the spiritual
splendor of Devi Uma, viz., ``Umasahasram' which is also addressed to our
beloved Mother Land. Kapali Shastri's commentary of Umasahasram called Prabha
brings it nearer to devoted readers.
<P>
Kapali Shastri met his first Guru, Vasishta Ganapati Muni in his twenties
and became his disciple instantly. Kapali Shastri says that he could get
the true picture of   Vedic culture and symbolic inner meaning that imbibes
psychological interpretation of Vedic hymns from this great teacher.
