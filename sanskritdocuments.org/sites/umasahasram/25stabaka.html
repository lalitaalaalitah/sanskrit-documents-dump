सप्तमं शतकम्  Seventh Shataka

पञ्चविंशः स्तबकः  25th Stabaka

क्षेत्रमाला  Garland of spiritual places in India

इन्द्रवज्रावृत्तम्  indravraja meter

In this stabaka the gods and goddesses established in the renowned
locations all over the country are hymned. In the beginning, south Indian
tirthakhsetras are taken up. The first goddess to be hymned is Kanyakumari,
who is situated on the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent.

कन्याकुमारी सुतरां वदान्या

मान्या समस्तैः प्रकृतेरनन्या |

आक्षेपकं सागरबुद्बुदानां

हासं विधत्तां जगतः सुखाय ||२५. १||

Kanyakumari is the most generous young goddess and she is worshipped by one
and all. She is considered the maya or prakruti i.e., creative power of the
Lord. May her bewitching smile that outshines the brightness of enormous foam
of the ocean situated near by secure the wellbeing of the world. ||25.1||

Kanyakumari kshetra is considered not so ancient by Shri Kapali Sharstriar.
' तत्र अर्वचिनतमम् ख़न्यकुमरिति प्रथितम्.' 
But this place was known to very early writers such as Kautilya,
Shabaraswami and others. Most of the puranas and the dharmashatras also
mention Kanyakumari. Aahimavataha akumaribhyah chakravarti kshetram says
Kautilya in Arthashstra. Himalayas in the north and Kanyakumari in the south
were considered the northern and southern tips of our country from a very
long time. Sutra works such as Paithinasi, have marked the southern tip of
Jambudvipa or Bharatavarsha as Kumari.(Bharariya Samskruti. Dr. S.Srikantha
Shastri). ||25.1||

रक्ष स्वचेतो मदमत्सरादेर्-

भिक्षस्व काले तनुरक्षणाय |

वीक्षस्व रामेशवधूपदाब्जं

मोक्षस्वलाभे यदि तेभिऽलाषः ||२५. २||

Oh Mind! If you are desirous of obtaining final beatitude, protect yourself
from pride and prejudice; take to alms to sustain your body. Serve at the
feet of the spouse of Ramesha viz., the goddess Parvatavardhini. ||25.2||

In this verse the Rameshwara Kshetra which is known for the Ramasetu
built by Sri Rama, hero of the national epic Ramayana and the goddess
Parvatavardhini, who is considered as the spouse of the Lord of Rameshwara
Kshetra are hymned. ||25.2||

लोकस्व दूरीकृतभक्तशोकं

हालास्यनाथेक्षणपुण्यपाकम् |

भीतिः सखे चेद्भवतः पवित्रं

ज्योतिर्विशेषं जलचारिनेत्रम् ||२५. ३||

Here, Goddess Meenakshi, along with Lord Sundareshwara, who is the presiding
deity of Madhurai Kshetra, is praised.

Oh Friend! If you are jaded with the dull mundane existence fearing the
evil effects of the same, have a look at the brilliant luster such as the
most sanctifying deity Meenakshi, who also happens to be the fruit of the
meritorious deeds of the eyes of Sundareshwara, her Lord; Meenakshi will
remove the fear of evil. ||25.3||

यो लोकते तामखिलाण्डराज्ञी-

मज्ञानविध्वंसविधानविज्ञाम् |

अम्बां परां जीवनलिङ्गशक्तिं

भूयः स कायं न भवे लभेत ||२५. ४||

In this verse deity Akhilandanayaki of Jambukeshwara Kshetra is praised.

He, who has a darshan of the Supreme Mother, who is the Empress of this
Brahmanda, who has the expertise in removing the ignorance of her devotees,
who is the power of Lord Jambukeshwara, the latter situated in waters in the
form of the linga, will not be born into this mundane world again. ||25.4||

बिभ्रत्सहस्रं च मुखानि शक्तो

वक्तुं गुणान् कः कमलालयस्य |

जन्मापि यत्र प्रभवेज्जनानां

मुक्त्यै मुनीनामपि दुर्लभायै ||२५. ५||

In this verse, the deity of Tiruvarur is hymned. Even a person with
thousand tongues like Adishesha, will not be able to describe the virtues
of the presiding deity of the Kamalalaya kshetra, because so benign is the
Lord here, that an ordinary person born here will obtain supreme beatitude,
not so easy to obtain even by sages. ||25.5||

In this Kshetra the Lord is Tyagaraja, along with his consort
Tripurasundaridevi. This kshetra is Mokshaprada is the essence. ||25.5||

व्याघ्राङ्घ्रिवाताशनपूजितस्य

नाट्यस्थलीनायिकया शिवस्य |

नेत्राध्वभाजा शिवकामया वो

मित्राणि कामाः फलिनो भवन्तु ||२५. ६||

The famous Chidambara Kshetra is described in this verse. Among the
celebrated panchabhuta kshetras, which are five in number, Chidambaram is
the first, known as Akasha Kshetra. ||25.6||

Oh my devoteefriends! May your wishes be fulfilled by goddess
Shivakameshwari, who presides over the dancing stage of her Lord Nataraja,
and seen by him intently. ||25.6||

Lord Shiva residing in this Chindambara Kshetra was worshipped by great
sages such as vyaghrapada and patanjali. Even a mere darshan of Shivakameswari,
the beloved mistress of Lord Nataraja, is wishfulfilling. ||25.6||

आलोकतेऽपीतकुचामयि त्वा-

मालोलचित्तामरुणाचले यः |

निर्वेदवान् पर्वसुधांशुवक्त्रे

सर्वे वशे तस्य भवन्ति कामाः ||२५. ७||

The deity in Arunachalakshetra is described here. Her name is
apitakuchamba.

Oh Mother with a face as delightful as the full moon! Even a suffering
individual deep in trouble, who takes a look at you, who resides here in the
form of apitakuchamba, with your mind fixed on Arunachaleshwara, your Lord,
is sure to get all his heartfelt desires fulfilled. ||25.7||

यः कुण्डलीपट्टणराजधानी-

मालोकते कामपि कृत्तमस्ताम् |

निस्सारमानन्दकथाविहीनं

संसारमेतं स जहाति बुद्ध्या ||२५. ८||

He who looks at Devi, in the form of Chinnamasta, whose capital is
Kundalipattana, will lose interest in this sapless world full of sorrow. ||
25.8||

Kundalipattana is the renowned Renuka Kshetra called Padaiveedu, in
Tamil. Here the devi is found as Chhinnamasta. This also happens to be one
of the important places where the poet performed severe austerities as a
part of his sadhana. ||25.8||

दृष्ट्वा वधूमादिपुरीश्वरस्य

यो लोचनारोचकमाधुनोति |

तस्यान्तरङ्गं धुतसर्वसङ्गं

भूयो भवारोचकमावृणोति ||२५. ९||

He who has a darshan of the spouse of the Lord of Adipuri is sure to be
relieved of his dejection; having attained inner peace, having developed
detachement from all unwanted objects, he will not consider rebirth as
despicable, since he will have the opportunity of getting the darshan of
Tripurasundari devi again and again. ||25.9||

The sacred place Adipuri is Tiruvottiyur (mentioned in this verse). The
idea is quite clear. A darshna of the Devi is so captivating that the devotee
would long for more births, in order to satisfy his eyes, than asking for
final beatitude. ||25.9||

काञ्ची रमण्याः कुरुतां गृहस्थे

क्वाणैर्मुदं कामपि किङ्किणीनाम् |

काञ्ची भुवः पुण्यपुरी यतीन्द्र

त्वामम्बिकानामरवैर्धिनोतु ||२५. १०||

Let the small jingling bells in the waist band of the beloved lady please the
house holder. Oh saint, may the city of Kanchi resounding with the innumerable
names of Kamakshi, the presiding deity of Kanchi, delight you. ||25.10||

Kanchipuram is a famous pilgrimage center in south India near Chennai. The
deity of the city is Kamakshi, another form of Devi Uma. This is the Prutvi
Kshetra of the five panchabhutha kshetras. ||25.10||

श्रीकालहस्तिस्थलदर्शनस्य

कैलासवीक्षां पुनरुक्तिमाहुः |

ज्ञानं प्रदातुं चरणाश्रितेभ्यो

ज्ञानाम्बिका यत्र निबद्धदीक्षा ||२५. ११||

After singing the glories of the holy places in the Tamil country, the
poet now turns towards the sacred location of Andhradesha. First Kalahasti
is taken up which is also known as the vayukshetra. ||25.11||

After visiting Kalahasti, trip to Kailasa Mountain is considered redundant
(so sacred is this place). Here resides Jnanambika, who is ever ready to
bestow wisdom on her devotees. ||25.11||

श्रीशैलशृङ्गस्य विलोकनेन

सङ्गेन हीनो भविता मनुष्यः |

धामास्ति यत्र भ्रमरालकायाः

शान्तभ्रमं तद्भ्रमराम्बिकायाः ||२५. १२||

By visiting the abode of the goddess Bhramarambika and obtaing the darshan
of the crest of the holy mountain called Srishaila, the visitor is freed
from worldly attachments. ||25.12||

The deity is so called because her curly hair resembles a row of
beesBhramara. The term Bhramarambika also means absence of illusion. There
is a pun on the word Bhramara bee and illusion. ||25.12||

तीरे विपश्चिद्वर पश्चिमाब्धेर्-

गोकर्णगां लोकय भद्रकर्णीम् |

बुद्धिं शिवां सर्वमनोरथानां

सिद्धिं च यद्यस्ति मनोऽधिगन्तुम् ||२५. १३||

Here the goddess by name Bhadrakarni, situated on the west coast to the
north of Kerala region is referred to. The place is the famous Gokarna kshetra,
presently in Karnataka.  Bhadrakarni is another name of kali.

Oh Learned Scholar! If you have a wish to get an auspicious mind and
fulfillment, do not fail to visit Gokarna Kshetra on the west coast of the
Indian subcontinent and pay respects to the deity Bhadrakarni. ||25.13||

धाम्नि प्रसिद्धे करवीरनाम्नि

पुण्याभिधानां कृतसन्निधानाम् |

देवीं परां पश्यति यो विरक्तो

मुक्तेः स पाणिग्रहणाय शक्तः ||२५. १४||

In this verse the famous Karavirakshetra, in the Maharastra region is
mentioned.  Even an ascetic who beholds the supreme goddess punya by name,
who has made her abode in the holy region of Karavira, is sure to be wedded
to the lady mukti beatitude!  The word mukti in Sanskrit is in feminine
gender. ||25.14||

ज्ञाने दृढा ते यदि कापि काङ्क्षा

नानेहसं मित्र मुधा क्षिपेमम् |

सेवस्व देवीं तुलजापुरस्थां

नैव स्वरूपादितरा किलेयम् ||२५. १५||

The goddess of Tulajapura in Utkal, eastern part of Bharat is mentioned
here.

Friend! If you are serious in attaining wisdom, do not waste your time any
more. You worship the goddess in Tulajapura, because she is not different
from atmasvarupa, pure consciousness. ||25.15||

गोपालिनीवेषभृतं भजस्व

लीलासखीं तां भुवनेश्वरस्य |

इष्टं हृदिस्थं तव हस्तगं स्यात्

कष्टं च संसारभवं न भूयः ||२५. १६||

get your thought translated into action and shall be freed from the sorrow

the capital city of the state of Orissa, utkal. ||25.16||

आराध्यते वैतरणीतटस्था

येनेयमम्बा विरजोऽभिधाना |

आराधितं तेन समस्तमन्यत्

सारो धरायामयमार्यगीतः ||२५. १७||

Worshipping the goddess Virajadevi, who is situated on the banks of the
river vaitarani is as good as worshiping every other deity. Viraja worship
is the essence of all worship says the wise. ||25.17||

सङ्गीयमानं स्थलमार्यबृन्दैर्-

बृन्दारकाणां सरितस्तटेऽस्ति |
