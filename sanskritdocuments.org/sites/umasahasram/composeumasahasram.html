<h3>
UMASAHASRAM AND ITS COMPOSITION</h3></b></center>
<UL><UL>
<P>
Articulated by Sri K. Natesan in collected works of Vasishtha Kavyakantha
Ganapati Muni.
<P>
It is customary in our spiritual tradition to endow the nameless, formless,
qualityless Absolute Brahman with a thousand names (sahasranama) or with
three hundred names (trishati), and also with one hundred and eight names
(ashtottarashatanama). It is a unique experience to worship the Lord with these
Divine names. ``Umatrishati,''  three hundred names of goddess Uma  is a most
beautiful composition of the seerpoet Kavyakantha. This is one of his powerful,
potent mantric utterances. The sound OM consists of three letters  A U M. The
word UMA too has these three letters in a transposed manner. This is the name
of the Primordial Shakti, the Mother Goddess of the universe. In tantrashastra,
Uma is considered to be the shaktapranava. Therefore, the trishati befittingly
starts with the names Uma and haimavati. The stories of devimahatmyam find
a place in this namavali (garland of names). The names of navadurga; the
ten cosmic powers of the Goddess, dashamahavidya; the saptamatrka (various
incarnations of the goddess) are described in this poem. The saguna (with
form) attributes of the Goddess  from the tresses on her head down to her
feet are also briefly narrated in some elegant verses. The trishati is an
exceedingly terse composition. The poet says in the concluding verse that
he has churned the ocean of all the vedas and shastras, taken the essence,
the cream, which is the nectar in the form of the ``Three Hundred Names of
Uma''. A recital of these names of Uma restores a person's poise in the Self
and also dispels the fear of enemies, diseases, death and all other obstacles.
<P>
In Umashatakam goddess Uma, the Mother of the Universe, is adored in a hundred
verses distributed over ten sections, each having ten verses. The first section
explains the svarupa (characterstic nature) of Uma. The second and third
deal with surrender. The fourth one is a prayer. Apitakuchamba, the consort
of Arunachala, is praised in the fifth. The sixth extols the glory of the
names of goddess Uma. The poet exhibits his genius in versification in both
the seventh and eighth sections. In the eighth section the ten incarnations
of Vishnu are also mentioned. The poet praises the compassionate glance of
the Goddess in the ninth, and the spiritual aspect of the Goddess is extolled
in the concluding ten verses.
<P>
Umaksharamala extolls goddess Uma in fifty verses arranged in Sanskrit
alphabetical order. All the vowels and consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet
have been made use of in this poem.
<P>
Umasahasram is the magnum opus of the Muni which he wrote after he accepted
Sri Ramana Maharshi as his guru. He composed the Umasahasram as a part of
his tapas, in gratitude to the great Goddess Uma for having given him the
Maharshi as his Master. After the momentous meeting with the Maharshi in 1907,
the Muni wanted to continue his tapas. At the suggestion of Sri Maharshi he
repaired to the Mangotree Cave in the Arunachala hills. Here he decided to
compose a thousand verses in praise of goddess Uma, and the Maharshi gave his
tacit approval and blessings. The Muni took a vow that he would complete the
thousand verses in twenty days and started the composition on 26.11.1907. But
no sooner did he begin the work an obstacle took place: a severe whitlow on
the writing finger of his right hand afflicted him. But by the grace of the
Goddess the finger healed miraculously and he resumed his writing.
<P>
On the last day (15.12.1907) he had yet to compose more than 200
verses. Resolutely facing the situation, he engaged five scribes and feverishly
dictated all the required verses in the night. The Maharshi sat by his side
with his eyes closed. It was midnight and all the verses of the Umasahasram
were completed. The Maharshi then slightly opened his eyes and asked:
``Have you written down all that was said?'' ``With your abounding grace I
have completed the task,'' replied the Muni, realizing that he owed to the
Maharshi the sudden flurry of inspiration that seized him, enabling him to
complete his immortal poem on Uma. As a result, each verse of Umasahasram has
the potency of a mantra. A devoted recital or even the mere reading of it can
bestow all happiness on the devout aspirant. As part of his tapas, the poet
revised this sacred text seven times. A copy of the final text, in Ganapati
Muni's own handwriting, was presented to Sri Aurobindo, before they met.
<P>
The text is divided into forty cantos, each having twentyfive verses. All
the verses in each canto are of the same meter. In all, the poet has used
twentynine different meters in this work. The first verse of each canto is a
benedictory verse, extolling the smile of the Goddess Uma. The last verse in
each canto mentions the name of the meter employed in the canto. The process
of creation, the supreme form of the Empress of all, the manifestation of the
Vedic and Tantric deities, the means to win their grace, yogic experiences
resulting from their upasana, the truth of the ten great vidyas, the way
of their adoration, the relevant sadhanas in the Upanishads  such are the
profound truths presented by the seerpoet in sublime poetry, drawing from the
deep reservoir of his personal spiritual experiences. Umasahasram is a living
synthesis of the Veda, the Upanishads and the Tantra, built out of his lifelong
realization in Yoga. Each verse opens the door to spiritual experience.
