NOTE FROM CO-TRANSLATOR</h3></b></center>
<UL><UL>
<P>
I was introduced to the works of Sri T. V. Kapali Shastri, a close disciple
of Sri Aurobindo, Vasishtha Ganapati Muni and Sri Ramana Maharshi by my
Guru Prof. R. L. Kashyap when I started my study of `Symbolism of Rigveda'
fifteen years ago.  I was awarded a Ph.D for my thesis based on Kapali
Shastri's commentary on the first ashtaka of Rigveda.  This monumental
work called `Siddhanjana' remains the only spiritual commentary written
on all the 121 suktas in the first ashtaka of Rigveda Samhita in Sanskrit.
<P>
Kapali Shastri's literary genius can be found in various forms of writing
like essays, commentaries, philosophical treatises, and poetry.  He was
a teacher, translator, exegisist, essayist, philosopher, and a great
sadhaka in the path of yoga and Tantra.  He has written a large number of
works related to the Veda, Upanishads, and Darshanas in Sanskrit, English,
Tamil, and Telugu languages which have enriched the knowledge contained in
our ancient scriptures with the light of his intuitive experience.  His
commentaries on all important works of Ganapati Muni and Sri Aurobindo
are held in high esteem.
<P>
I was approached by my friend Prof. S. R. Leela, a well known scholar, about
four years ago to join her in translating `Umasahasram', a collection
of thousand poems in adoration of Devi Uma by Vasishtha Ganapati Muni
into English.  I readily accepted since I was drawn to the deep thoughts
of yogic experience of the poet in `Umasahasram', through the commentary,
`Prabha' written by Kapali Shastri.
<P>
During the course of translation, I came to know Ms Daksha Dalal's ardent
aspiration to publish the translation.  I have watched in great admiration
her working towards this goal since she conceived of the idea, despite
a number of impediments on this long journey.  I offer my humble pranamas
to her on the completion of the project, an occasion of great joy!

DIVINE SPORT OF DEVI UMA IN UMASAHASRAM
<P>
Umasahasram is not just the poet's adulation of Devi Uma.  It reveals the
experiential knowledge of Vasishtha Ganapati Muni in Veda, Upanishads,
and Tantra Shastra.  He being a practicing yogi, his inner visions of
the divine sport of Devi Uma flow naturally and are a beautifully woven
garland of words.  Kapali Shastri, being equally equipped with all the
embellishing abilities of his guru brings it more nearer to aspirants
with his vivid commentary, `Prabha'.
<P>
He had come in contact with his first Guru, Vasishtha Ganapati Muni in his
early twenties, and became his disciple instantly.  He was initiated into
the inner meaning of the Vedic Gods and in depth experiential knowledge of
Tantra Shastra from him.  He pays tribute to his Guru in his Introduction,
bhashyabhumika of Siddhanjana: ``....  it was the late Kavyakantha Vasishtha
Ganapati Muni, whom we adored and addressed as Nayana (beloved father)
who in a way first opened my eyes.  It was he who since 1907 took me as
his own and guided me in many branches of Sanskrit study and laid in me
the foundations for spiritual life, which in later years grew to claim
me in its entirety.  It was in 1910 that he favored me with instructions
regarding the deities of the Rigveda and the depth of thought in the
Vedic hymns.''

MY JOURNEY WITH UMASAHASRAM
<P>
Even though I had read and reread the works of Vasishtha Ganapati Muni
and Kapali Shastri, I realized during my translation how difficult it
is to express esoteric poetry in an alien language.  My translation
progressed slowly but it was a marvelous experience! The Glories of Devi
Uma affected me deeper day by day, taking my mind to a bigger world around
us.  I experienced a great feeling of being a part of the whole Universe.
<P>
I thank my guru Prof. R. L. Kashyap who inducted me into the study of
spiritual insights of our great works.  I also thank Prof. S. R. Leela
and Smt. Daksha Dalal for including me in this project and supporting
me with gentle reminders.  My humble pranamas to Sri T. V. Kapali Shastri
and to his gurus as well as to Sri M. P. Pandit whose rendering of hundred
verses of Umasahasram viz, `Adoration of the divine mother' has inspired
my translation.  He has done a great service to spiritual aspirants by
publishing all the works of Kapali Shastri in eleven volumes titled
`Collected Works of Kapali Shastri'.
<P>
I could not reproduce the poetic beauty of Umasahasram but I will be
happy if my efforts facilitate the discerning readers in understanding
the insights of Vedic, Tantric, and Yogic experiences of the poet which
help us feel the bigger plan of the supreme power play of Devi Uma in
the universe as well as in our lives.
