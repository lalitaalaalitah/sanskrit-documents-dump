पञ्चत्रिंशः स्तबकः  35th Stabaka

प्रार्थना  Prayer to Mother describing her virtues and boons

इन्दुवदनावृत्तम्  Induvadanaa meter

अन्धतमसं शशिविभामभिदधाना

कान्तिमलमास्यकमलस्य विदधाना |

अन्धकविरोधिदयितास्मितलवश्रीर्-

भातु भुवनस्य सकलस्य कुशलाय ||३५. १||

Though moonlight dispels the blinding darkness the radiance of the lotuslike
face (of Divine Mother) is enough to do this job. May a particle of the
beauty of smile of the consort of the enemy of Andhaka (i.e Lord Shiva)
enlighten the whole world and promote welfare. ||35.1||

भाहि विविधा कृतिमती द्विजसमूहे

पाहि गतिहीनमखिलेश्वरि कुलं नः |

देहि बहुकालभजकाय वरमेतं

याहि नगनन्दिनि यशः शशिवलक्षम् ||३५. २||

Oh Queen of All! Empress of the worlds! Daughter of the mountain! Mother
Parvati! Glorify the talents of the learned brahmanas for the good of the
world. Please protect our clan (could mean nation, community or human race)
that is facing deterioration. Please bestow your boons on me who has been
worshipping you since long. Bring the moonlight of success. ||35.2||

वारयति घोरतरपातकसमूहं

वर्धयति धर्ममपि शर्मकरमन्ते |

किङ्करजनस्य न किमावहति भव्यं

शङ्करपुरन्ध्रि तव पादपरिचर्या ||३५. ३||

Oh wife of Shankara! The queen of Shiva! The worship of thy feet removes
even the most terrible of sins. It nourishes dharma (virtue or values)
that yeilds good fruits at the end. What good does it not bring to thy
servants? ||35.3||

यस्य मनुजस्य हृदयेऽस्ति सदये ते

नाकचरसेव्यमयि पादसरसीजम् |

तं भजति पद्ममुखि पद्मवनवासा

लाभभवने भवतु नामरपुरोधाः ||३५. ४||

Oh compassionate one! Lakshmi, (who resides in the lotus) the goddess
of wealth comes to only those who host thy lotus feet, which are served
always by the celestials in their heart. So what if the priest of gods does
not enter the house of profit (in the horoscope)? (i.e wealth comes to the
worshipper of the divine Mother, even if he is not intelligent). ||35.4||

According to Indian astrological principles, Brishaspati or the planet
Jupiter is the bestower of knowledge and intelligence. This is termed as
gurubala. Brishaspati is the guide and priest of the gods. ||35.4||

यद्यखिलमौनिगणगीतगुणजालं

कालभयहारिकरुणारसमरन्दम् |

अद्रितनयाङ्? घ्रिजलजन्म हृदये स्या-

दष्टमगतोऽपि विदधातु रविजः किम् ||३५. ५||

If the nectar of compassion of the lotus feet of Devi that is praised
by clans of great sages resides in the heart what evil can Saturn, even on
entering the 8th Zodiac house do? ||35.5||

This verse also refers to Indian astrology. Saturn in the eighth house is
considered to be very dangerous because it causes lot of suffering. This is
known as ashtamashani. ||35.5||

लेखललनाकचसुमैः कृतबलिं ते

यो भजति पादघृणिमालिनमनन्ते |

निस्तरति नूनमयमस्तमितमोहः

शोकतिमिरं सकललोकगणमातः ||३५. ६||

Oh Mother of all the worlds! He who worships your feet with the flowers
that are worthy of decorating the tresses of the celestial women, his delusion
and darkness of grief shall vanish. ||35.6||

शीतकरदर्पहरवक्त्रजलजाते

शीतगिरिनन्दिनि तवाङ्घ्रिजलजातम् |

यः स्मरति देवि हृदि विस्मरति सोऽयं

विष्टपमशेषमपि कष्टततिमुक्तः ||३५. ७||

Oh, Mother! Daughter of the snow peaks, who possesses the lotus like face
that puts to shame the beauty of the moon, he who meditates upon your lotus
feet in his heart is relieved of series of difficulties and astonishes the
whole world. ||35.7||

Unaware of the world, being engrossed in the bliss of meditation and
chanting, is not like the forgetfulness that intoxication of sleep or alcohol
give. Because the latter are not capable of giving salvation. ||35.7||

सक्तिरयि यस्य तव पादसरसीजे

शक्तिधरमातरनलाक्षगृहनाथे |

पूर्णशशिजैत्रमुखि पुण्यपुरुषोऽसौ

स्वर्णशिखरीव बुधलोकशरणं स्यात् ||३५. ८||

Oh Mother of Subramanya (wielder of the weapon)! Shakti! The consort of the
fire eyed Shiva! You have the face that conquers the moon (in beauty). He who
devotes oneself to your lotus feet stands tall like mount Meru and becomes
the refuge to the world of scholars; i.e., he is respected and adored by
the wise. ||35.8||

वैरिगणनिर्दलनखड्गवरपाणे

वाससि पदोर्दशनवाससि च शोणे |

नेत्रमिषपावकविशेषितललाटे

पापमखिलं जहि मृगाधिपतिघोटे ||३५. ९||

Oh, Mother! You wield the sword in order to annihilate the enemies. Your
lips, clothes and feet are stained with blood (of the wicked). The eye on
your forehead is fiery. Your vehicle is the Lion. Please do defeat all sin
and vice (in me). ||35.9||

वेदचयवेदिजनवादविषयस्य

प्रतियुतलोकततिशोकशमनस्य |

वेतनविवर्जितभटोऽयमहमङ्घ्रेः

शीतकरपोतधरपुण्यवनिते ते ||३५. १०||

Oh Divine consort of Shiva who bears (on his locks) the moon! Thy feet
happen to be the topic of discussion of all the great scholars of vedas. They
also put an end to the difficulties experienced by thy devotees. I am the
servant of thy feet, not desiring even the fee for my services. ||35.10||

कार्यमयि मे किमपि कार्यपटुबुद्धेः

पादसरसीजयुगलीपरिजनस्य |

अम्ब वद जम्भरिपुगीतगुणजाले

शुम्भकुलनाशकरि शम्भुकुलयोषे ||३५. ११||

Oh, Mother! Desrtoyer of the clan of the demon Shumbha! The consort
of Shambhu! Your wonderful virtues are praised by Indra, the enemy of
Jambha. Please do ordain a task unto me, who is good at work and is committed
to the service of thy lotus feet. ||35.11||

त्वं यदि शिलावदयि नो वदसि कृत्यं

नास्ति तव राज्यपटुबुद्धिरिति सत्यम् |

आदिश यथार्हकरणीयकृतिनित्यं

राज्ञि भुवनस्य चरणाम्बुरुहभृत्यम् ||३५. १२||

Oh, Mother! You are the queen of this world. If you remain stonelike speaking
nothing, without telling us our duties, it means perhaps that there is no one
in this world who is capable enough to fulfill them indeed. (Or we may say
that) Despite being famed as the queen of the world you are not efficient in
statesmanship. (so in order to avoid such an allegation), please ordain me,
a slave of your feet, with worthy tasks. ||35.12||

पञ्चसु विहाय मनसः कमपि सङ्गं

पुत्रधनमित्रजनबान्धववधूषु |

एष भजते जननि पादजलजं ते

पालय नु मुञ्च नु तवोपरि स भारः ||३५. १३||

Oh, Mother! People (including me) give up attachment to five things
namelysons, wealth, friends, relatives and wives and instead worship thy
feet. It is left to you whether you protect them or ignore them! ||35.13||

वज्रधरमुख्यसुरसञ्चयकिरीट-

स्थापितमहार्घमणिरञ्जितनखाय |

जीवितमदायि जगदीश्वरि मदीयं

पादजलजाय तव पालय नु मा वा ||३५. १४||

Oh Ruler of the universe! My life is dedicated to thy feet, the luster
of whose nails, are rendered colorful by the reflections of the unique gems
studded on the crowns of gods like Indra (when they prostrate to thee). Protect
or discard me (do as you please!). ||35.14||

देहि जगदीश्वरि न वा मदभिलाषं

पाहि करुणावति न वा कुलमिदं नः |

शूलधरकामिनि सुरासुरनिषेव्यं

पादकमलं तव परे न विजहामि ||३५. १५||

Oh Mother of the Universe! Consort of Rudra, who wields the trident! Whether
or not you bestow upon me my cherished desire, whether or not you protect
this clan of bharatiyas, I shall not leave thy lotus feet, that are constantly
served by the celestials. ||35.15||

पासि किल पादयुगकिङ्करसमूहं

हंसि किल पापततिमापदि नुता त्वम् |

दन्तिवदनप्रसु वदन्ति मतिमन्तो

नानृतमिदं भवतु नाकिजनवर्ण्ये ||३५. १६||

Oh, Mother! You are praised by the residents of the heavens! You shall
indeed protect the people who are servants of thy feet, isn't it? You shall
indeed destroy the woes and sins of those who are fallen in calamities,
isn't it? Oh Mother of the elephant headed (Ganesha) who displays tusks on
his face! The wise say thus (that you protect us all). May not the words of
the wise men become fabrications. ||35.16||

शक्रमुखदेवततिवन्दितविसृष्टे

वक्रघनकेशि चरणे तव लुठन्तम् |

आपदि निमग्नमिममाश्रितमनाथं

नन्दिहयसुन्दरि न पालयसि केन ||३५. १७||

Oh Mother who has curved locks, black like the clouds! You are saluted
by Gods like Indra! May men who are drowned in difficulties get freed from
bondages and rather get bonded to thy feet. Oh, Mother! You are the consort
of Shiva who has Nandi, the bull as his vehicle. Why then don't you protect
me, an orphan, (who has nowhere to go), (even after I have) surrendered and
taken refuge in you? ||35.17||

घोषमयमम्ब विदधाति पदलग्नो

नावसि पुराणि किमु नारि बधिराऽसि |

वन्दिसुरबृन्दनुतिभाषितहृतं वा

कर्णयुगलं तव कपालिकुलयोषे ||३५. १८||

Oh, Mother! Having bonded with thy feet I am crying out. Oh the most ancient
and wise woman! Consort of Puranapurusha, The eternal Lord! You neither
protect not bless. Are you then deaf? Oh consort of Kapali! Are your ears
(focus) lost in listening to the praises of the celestials always? Tell me
then what is the reason for you not listening to my cries. Is it deafness or
unmindfulness due to listening to the praises of the celestials? ||35.18||

अम्ब भव बिम्बफलकल्परदचेले

शम्बरसपत्नबलकारिबहुलीले |

प्रागमृतभानुमुकुटस्य मदयित्री

तं कुरु ततः परमुरीकृतमदर्थम् ||३५. १९||

Oh, Mother! Your raiments are red like the seeds of the bimba fruit. Oh
knower of many leelas (tricks) of Manmatha (the Lord of Love)! You fascinate
Lord Shiva, first (and then the attention of both of you can turn towards
me). ||35.19||

निर्मलसुधाकरकलाकलितमस्ते

धर्मरतपालिनि दयावति नमस्ते |

एतमव देवि चरणाम्बुरुहबन्धुं

शीतधरणीधरसुते गमय नान्धुम् ||३५. २०||

Oh, Mother! Whose crest is beautified by the radiant moon! Oh
compassionate one who protects the virtuous! Salutations to thee! Please
protect me who is a close relative of thy lotus feet. Oh Mother Parvati,
the daughter of the Himalayan mountains! Do not make me fall into the well
(of blindness). Pray! let there be no downfall. ||35.20||

अद्रिकुलपालककुलध्वजपताके

भद्रगजगामिनि दरिद्रमयि मत्या |

क्षुद्रमिव शोच्यमिममङ्घ्रिजलजाप्तं

रुद्रदयिते जननि पाहि न जहीहि ||३५. २१||

Oh Mother who is the flag (symbol) of victory for the Himalayan clan! Lady
with a majestic gait (resembles that of an youthful elephant)! I, the kith
of thy lotus feet, suffer from poverty of intelligence, is indeed worthy
of thy pity. Oh consort of Rudra! Please do not discard me as lowly, rather
protect and bless me. ||35.21||

अस्तु तव पादकमले स्थितिरजस्रं

नास्ति परदुःखविवशे हृदि तु शान्तिः |

अस्तु करुणेऽयमस्तु मतिलोपः

कष्टमिदमम्ब मम भूरि परिशिष्टम् ||३५. २२||

Oh, Mother! May I foever be established at thy feet. My heart, overflowing
with sorrow for the plight of others who are in difficulties, knows no
peace. This may be perhaps lack of intelligence. But still, this is a big
problem I am facing. Kindly take me to thy care. ||35.22||

दुःखसुखभेदरहिता न मतिरासीत्

साधुखलभेदरहिता न मतिरासीत् |

भाग्यमितिमान्यमथवा मम तदेतन्-

मातरिह सङ्घभजने यदवकाशः ||३५. २३||

Oh, Mother! My intellect is not devoid of the duality of joy and
sorrow. Nor has it overcome the discrimination between the virtuous and vice
people. Although the shastras preach about a balanced outlook (samabuddhi),
I do not possess the same. Or may be this is a blessing in disguise for me,
as this enables me to participate in community service and activities. ||
35.23||

One who rises above discrimination of any type cannot engage himself in
social activites. ||35.23||

अस्तु मम भेदमतिरस्तु मम पक्षो

यत्नपरताऽस्तु मम मास्तु च विमोक्षः |

मोक्षमयि वेद्मि कुलकष्टततिमोक्षं

प्रेषय सकृत्तव महेश्वरि कटाक्षम् ||३५. २४||

Let this discrimination remain in me. May this be helpful to me in my
achievements. May my endeavour keep me engaged. I do not seek the wisdom
that frees me form the bonds of birth and death. Oh Mother Goddess! I believe
that obtaining freedom for Bharatiyas, is salvation for me. Therefore bless
me with thy gracious looks. May the discrimination in me help me achieve
salvation in the form of freedom of my countrymen. ||35.24||

शाक्वरगणेन मुखरेऽत्र गणनाथे

विष्णुयशसीशवधु जिष्णुमुखवन्द्ये |

अम्ब करुणां कुरु शिवङ्करि निरङ्क-

स्वच्छकिरणार्भकविभूषितललाटे ||३५. २५|| ८७५

Oh Consort of Ishwara! Saluted by great ones like Vishnu! Oh Mother whose
forehead is ornate with the flawless crescent moon! Oh Mother Ambe! Pray,
bestow ausipiciousness and compassion on us! ||35.25||

Ganapati, son of Parvati is spoken of as Vishnu also. The famous verse
shuklambharadharam vishnum etc., recited at the begining of perfoming any act
can be interpreted as referring to Vishnu as well as to Ganapati. ||35.25||
