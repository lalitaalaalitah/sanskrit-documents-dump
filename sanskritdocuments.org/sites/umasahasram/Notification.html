<P>
Sanskritdocuments.org is pleased to release online English translation of Umasahasram composed by Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni.
<P>
The translation project is an initiative of several individuals to honor Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni along with T.V. Kapali Sastri and M.P. Pandit for their unique contribution and legacy towards Sanskrit Literature, unveiling secrets of Vedas and Tantras.
<P>
Our wish is to support the free access of Umasahasram translation for generating much needed enthusiasm for established and budding scholars and for presenting the spiritual traditions and rich cultural heritage from Greater India.
