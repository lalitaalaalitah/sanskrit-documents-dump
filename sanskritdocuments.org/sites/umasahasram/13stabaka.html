||उमासहस्रम् ||||umAsahasram ||

चतुर्थं शतकम्  Fourth Shataka

त्रयोदशः स्तबकः  13th Stabaka

कटाक्षः  glance

उपजातिवृत्तम्  Upajati meter

भवाम्बुधिं तारयताद्भवन्तं

हासोऽद्भुतः कुञ्जरवक्त्रमातुः |

यो हन्ति बिम्बाधरलङ्घनेऽपि

व्यक्तालसत्वो हरितां तमांसि ||१३. १||

Let the wonderful smile of the mother of Ganesha help you cross the ocean
of this mundane existence. Though the gentle smile just crosses the bimba
like lips of the Mother, it is capable of dispelling the dense darkness
spread in all directions. ||13.1||

सक्तः सदा चन्द्रकलाकलापे

सर्वेषु भूतेषु दयां दधानः |

गौरीकटाक्षो रमणो मुनिर्वा

मदीयमज्ञानमपाकरोतु ||१३. २||

Let the benevolent glance of the Devi and the sage Ramana, both always
associated with the cool moonlight, and compassionate towards all beings,
dispel my ignorance. ||13.2||

कृपावलोको नगकन्यकायाः

करोतु मे निर्मलमन्तरङ्गम् |

येनाङ्कितः शङ्कर एकतत्त्वं

विश्वं लुलोके जगते जगौ च ||१३. ३||

May the compassionate glance of the Devi, the Daughter of the Mountain,
cleanse my inner being; associated by which look, even the mighty Lord
Shankara visualizes and praises the world as one principle. ||13.3||

कालीकटाक्षो वचनानि मह्यं

ददातु मोचामदमोचनानि |

यत्पातपूतं रघुवंशकारं

नराकृतिं प्राहुरजस्य नारीम् ||१३. ४||

Let the Kataksha of the goddess Kali bestow on me such wordpower, which
can give me the joy of liberty, (because) Even kalidasa, the author of the
Mahakavya Raghuvamsam revered as the avatara of Saraswati, the queen of
Brahma, sanctified by the looks of Kali Devi. ||13.4||

Here is a reference to the anecdote, which says that Kalidasa received
his poetic skills due to the blessings of Kali, giving him his renowned name
Kalidasa. ||13.4||

युष्माकमग्र्यां वितनोतु वाणी-

मेणीदृगेषा गिरिशस्य योषा |

यस्याः कटाक्षस्य विसारि वीर्यं

गिरामयं मे विविधो विलासः ||१३. ५||

Let the beautiful doeeyed damsel of Shankara bestow on you the best of
speech. Because it is the allpervading vital power of the glance of this
goddess that has endowed the many folded grace and beauty to my speech,
i.e. my poetry. ||13.5||

नगात्मजायाः करुणोर्मिशाली

दृगन्तसन्तानधुनीप्रवाहः |

भीष्मेण तप्तान्भवनामकेन

ग्रीष्मेण युष्माँच्छिशिरीकरोतु ||१३. ६||

Let the stream of glances full of sympathy for people, issuing forth from the
corners of the eyes of the daughter of the mountain; alleviate the scorching
heat you are exposed to in the form of temporal existence. ||13.6||

अजस्रमार्द्रा दर्ययाऽन्तरङ्गे

यथा भवो निम्नगयोत्तमाङ्गे |

सन्तापशान्तिं भवसुन्दरी मे

करोतु शीतेन विलोकितेन ||१३. ७||

Just as Lord Iswara has rendered my head, cool with Ganga, let the consort
of Lord Iswara, always compassionate to all, and remove my inner affliction
by her cool looks. ||13.7||

पुण्या सदाऽपीश्वर एव सक्ता

पतिव्रतासाम्यमिता तवेक्षा |

कुलाचलाधीश्वरकन्यके मे

संहरमंहोविततेर्विधत्ताम् ||१३. ८||

Oh the daughter of the Lord of Kula Mountain! Your glance is balanced and
meritorious as it rests incessantly on the Lord. That is why you are praised
as the ideal chaste wife. Pray! Let your great glance destroy my sense of
ego at once. ||13.8||

शर्वस्य रामे नियमेन हीना

श्यामा तवेक्षा गणिकाङ्गनेव |

नीचेऽपि मर्त्ये निपतत्यनर्घा

बिभर्ति ना षोडश यः सुवर्णान् ||१३. ९||

Oh the beloved of Sharva! Your glance is like a lovely way ward woman,
bereft of all codes of social conduct. It offers itself to anyone, even a
lowly person, who can fetch sixteen gold coins! ||13.9||

The word suvarna here is punned. It means gold coins as well as good
letters. Sixteen suvarna means the sixteenlettered mantra of the Devi,
well known as the Shodashakshari mantra. ||13.9||

पद्मायताक्षि क्षितिधारिकन्ये

कटाक्षनामा तव कालसर्पः |

यं सन्दशत्येष जगत्समस्तं

विस्मृत्य चाहो न दधाति मोहम् ||१३. १०||

Oh, the lotus eyed daughter of the mountain! Your glance verily is a cobra,
one who is bitten by this cobra, forgets the whole world without losing his
consciousness. (He does not swoon, peculiar indeed!) ||13.10||

ईशद्विषा शैलमहेन्द्रकन्ये

करोति मैत्रीं विषमायुधेन |

प्रभाषते पातकिनश्च पक्षे

कुतः कटाक्षो न तवाम्ब मुग्धः ||१३. ११||

Oh the daughter of the mighty mountain, your glance that makes friendship
with even the foe of your Lord, speaks in favor of sinners. Why is it that
your glance is so innocent? ||13.11||

कृपान्वितः कर्णसमीपचारी

श्रीमान्सदा पुण्यजनानुकूलः |

साम्यं कुरुणामधिपस्य शम्भोः

प्राणप्रिये ते भजते कटाक्षः ||१३. १२||

Oh Devi! Loved by Shambhu as his own lifebreath, your glance resembles the
lord of the kurus as you are compassionate (flagged by krupa) always moving
around the ear (associated with Karna) possessed of richness it helps the
virtuous. (Punyajana helpful towards Asuras).

(Krupa, Karna are the names of characters from the epic Mahabharata. They
were great warriors on the side of Duryodhana, lord of the kurus. Punyajana
also means asura or demon. Punning on these words may be noted). ||13.12||

कर्णान्तिकस्थोऽपि न धर्मवैरी

कृष्णोऽपि मतार्नकुलं न पाति |

शीतोऽपि सन्दीपयति स्मराग्निं

हरस्य ते शैलसुते कटाक्षः ||१३. १३||

Oh, Mother! your glance is very strange (full of contradictions)
indeed! Though close to Karna(ear) is not an enemy of Dharma, though it can be
described as Krishna (dark), the great Lord considered as Pandavapakshapati,
does not protect Nakula, one of the Pandava brothers; though cool, fans the
fire of love of Kamari, Lord Shiva. ||13.13||

Punning on Karna, Krishna and other words is seen. Seeming contradiction
is removed if these words are understood according to the context. ||13.13||

अयं कटाक्षस्तव तोयवाहः

कारुण्यकाले परिजृम्भमाणः |

गृहेषु लीनान् सुखिनो विहाय

निराश्रयान् सिञ्चति विश्वमातः ||१३. १४||

Oh Mother of the Universe! Your glance is a cloud that spreads its protective
shade all over, as and when the need for showing sympathy arises. It leaves
out those who sit quite in the cozy comforts of their homes but sprinkles
showers of joy on those who are outside, having no support (other than
you). ||13.14||

Grha symbolizes physical pleasures. Nirashrayin means an aspirant, who
gives up everything else to get the blessings of the Goddess. The alankara
is metaphor or rupaka, between two sets viz., kataksha and toyavaha, glance
and cloud; Karunya and Varshakala, compassion and rainy season. ||13.14||

कस्यापि वाचा वपुषा बलेन

समस्य सर्वैरपि यन्निदेशाः |

अम्भोधिवेलास्वपि न स्खलन्ति

शम्भोः प्रियेऽयं तव दृक्प्रसादः ||१३. १५||

Oh Beloved wife of Shambhu! The fact that even an ordinary one, who is not
very different from others by his speech, looks, prowess and other attainments,
extends his sway over the ocean, i.e. reigns supreme like a monarch, is
nothing but a boon conferred on him by your glance alone. ||13.15||

A man achieves his best only by your grace is an undeniable fact. Without
the grace of the goddess man cannot achieve anything unique in this world. ||
13.15||

द्वारेषु तेषां विचरन्ति शूराः

सौधेषु सारङ्गदृशस्तरुण्यः |

प्रगल्भवाचः कवयः सभासु

शर्वाणि ते येषु कृपाकटाक्षः ||१३. १६||

Oh Sharvani! He is truly fortunate on whom your compassionate glance
rests. His doors are secured by the brave and the valiant; in his mansions
lovely women reside; his assemblies are adorned by learned and gifted
poets. ||13.16||

Those who receive the blessings of the goddess enjoy the best of life. Kali
gifts him prowess, Lakshmi bestows wealth and Saraswati gives learning. ||
13.16||

यत्राम्ब ते कोऽपि कटाक्षलेशः

स दुर्जयः सङ्गरसीम्नि शूरः |

पूर्वं दिवं पूरयति द्विषद्भि-

स्ततो यशोभिर्भुवमिन्दुगौरैः ||१३. १७||

Oh, Mother! Even a small flash of your glance falling on a man makes him
victorious in fiercely fought battles; he would be able to first fill the
heaven with enemies and later the earth with his fame, cool and pleasant
like moonlight. ||13.17||

It is a belief that anyone who dies in the battle reaches heavenly abode. ||
13.17||

यं तारकाकान्तकलापकान्ते

न लोकसे कोऽपि न लोकते तम् |

यं लोकसे तेन विलोकितोऽपि

श्रियं समृद्धां समुपैति लोकः ||१३. १८||

Oh the beloved wife of the Lord, who has moon on his crest, Goddess,
no one takes cognizance of a person whom you do not grace by your glance;
whereas even a person seen by another whom you have blessed by your look,
will attain great wealth in this world. ||13.18||

Even an indirect contact with the blessed look of the Devi yields
marvelous results is the gist of this verse. Slightest favor yields enormous
prosperity. ||13.18||

सुधां हसन्ती मधु चाक्षिपन्ती

यशो हरन्ती वनिताधरस्य |

परिष्करोत्यस्य कवित्वधारा

मुखं हरप्रेयसि लोकसे यम् ||१३. १९||

Oh Devi! Whomever you grace with your glance, is bound to develop into
a poet par excellence; No surprise if the sweetness and attraction of his
poetry insults nectar, surpasses honey and challenges the kisses of lovely
women. ||13.19||

The goddess by her glance can inspire soul stirring poetry is the
suggestion. Malopama is the figure of speech as the poetic flow is compared
to many upamanas. ||13.19||

सर्वेन्द्रियानन्दकरी पुरन्ध्री

विद्याऽनवद्या विपुला च लक्ष्मीः |

इयं त्रिरत्नी पुरुषस्य यस्य

दुर्गे त्वया दृष्टमिमं तु विद्मः ||१३. २०||

Oh Durgadevi! We are certain that anyone who possesses the gifts such as
a beautiful wife, deep learning and fabulous wealth, is only because of your
unfailing blessings in the form of your glance. ||13.20||

Without your grace all these three cannot be obtained by any one. ||
13.20||

मुधा क्षिपस्यद्रिसुते कटाक्षान्

कैलासकान्तारमहीरुहेषु |

इतः किरेषत्तव नास्ति हानिः

सिद्ध्यत्यभीष्टं च समस्तमस्य ||१३. २१||

Oh Girija! Why do you waste your fruitful glances by looking at the bare
forest lands of the Kailasa Mountain? You lose nothing if you turn your glances
on me; on the contrary, I gain everything worth possessing. ||13.21||

शीताचलाधीशकुमारि शीतः

संरक्षणे संश्रितमानवानाम् |

दुर्धर्षदुष्टासुरमर्दनेषु

नितान्तमुष्णश्च तवावलोकः ||१३. २२||

Oh Daughter of the cool mountain! Your look which is soothing and cool at
the time of affording protection to those, who seek refuge in you, becomes
unbearably hot while subduing the evil asuras, formidable in battle. ||
13.22||

Because the same glance is described in two ways, it is ullekhalankara. ||
13.22||

रुषा समेतं विदधाति नाशं

करोति पोषं कृपया सनाथम् |

अम्बौषधस्येव तवेक्षितस्य

योगस्य भेदेन गुणस्य भेदः ||१३. २३||

Oh, Mother! Your angry look destroys and compassionate look protects. It
is like the medicinal combination, which can either aggravate or cure the
disease when administered in different measures. ||13.23||

The words yoga  guna are technical terms in the system of Ayurveda medicine
and have pun on them. ||13.23||

नाशाय तुल्योद्धतकामलोभ-

क्रोधत्रिदोषस्य भवामयस्य |

शिवप्रिये वीक्षितभेषजं ते

क्रीणानि भक्त्या वद भोः कियत्या ||१३. २४||

Oh the Beloved of Lord Shiva! Tell me by what measures of bhakti can I buy
the medicine of your glance? Indeed it is a potent medicine which cures two
diseases at the same time; one, vices of kama, lobha etc, mental ailments,
the other which affects the body. ||13.24||

Both the physical and mental ailments are cleansed by this potent
medicine. It is a Savayava rupaka alankara. ||13.24||

अभिष्टुतां चारणसिद्धसङ्घै-

स्त्रिष्टुब्विशेषा अपि मर्त्यसूनोः

कृपाकटाक्षैर्विनतान्पुनानां

कपर्दिनः सम्मदयन्तु कान्ताम् ||१३. २५||३२५

It is my humble prayer that these verses composed by a mortal, should
delight the divine consort of the Lord Kapardi; she is the great goddess
always praised even by celestial beings like charanas and siddhas. She
sanctifies those who seek refuge in her by her looks. ||13.25||
