अष्टमः स्तबकः  8th Stabaka

अनुष्टुब्वृत्तम्  Anushtub meter

चरित्रत्रयम्  Three anecdotes

Devi is adored in this Stabaka through her famous act of annihilation of
demons Madhu, Kaitabha etc.

तमसामभितो हन्ता चन्डिकाहासवासरः |

सतां हृदयराजीवविकासाय प्रकल्पताम् ||८. १||

The daybreak smile of Chandika removes ignorance like daybreak removes
the darkness of ignorance all round. May that smile bless the pious people
to bloom the lotus of their hearts. ||8.1||
डेवि' स् ब्लेस्सिन्ग् इस् वेर्य् एस्सेन्तिअल् फ़ोर् अवकेनिन्ग् आनहत छक्र

या निद्रा सर्वभूतानां योगनिद्रा रमापतेः |

ईड्यतां सा महाकाली महाकालसखी सखे ||८. २||

Mahakali who is in the form of sleep of all living beings manifests as yogic
sleep (yoganidra) in Vishnu. Oh, my friend (devotee), the glory of Mahakali,
consort of Mahakala may be praised. ||8.2||

Sleep of all living beings refers to lack of memory of the Self. ||8.2||

विरिञ्चिना स्तुते मातः कालि त्वं चेन्न मुञ्चसि |

मधुकैटभसंहारं करोतु कथमच्युतः ||८. ३||

Oh, Mother! Your manifestation as yoganidra in Mahavishnu left him when
you were praised by Brahma. Otherwise, how could Vishnu annihilate the demons
Madhu and Kaitabha? ||8.3||

Vishnu could annihilate the demons only after Devi released him from the
influence of her yoganidra. ||8.3||

वासवः काशनीकाशयशोलङ्कृतदिङ्मुखः |

महोग्रविक्रमाद्यस्मादासीदाजौ पराङ्मुखः ||८. ४||

Poet describes the great strength of demon Mahisha in following ten verses in
order to establish the greatest power of Devi who put an end to his tyranny.

Indra, whose pure fame had decorated all the directions, was defeated in
war by that great powerful warrior (Mahisha). ||8.4||

kashanikashayashas fame that is white like kasha pushpa; white kashi flower
refers to the pure fame.

यत्प्रतापेन सन्तप्तो मन्ये बाडबरूपभृत् |

भगवाननलोऽद्यापि सिन्धुवासं न मुञ्चति ||८. ५||

It feels as if Agni has not yet left his abode in the ocean in which he
took shelter in the form of Badaba when he was scorched by the valor of
Mahishasura. ||8.5||

Badabagni, an aspect of fire is present in the deep currents of ocean
according to the ancient belief. ||8.5||

कुर्वाणे भूतकदनं यस्मिन्विस्मितचेतसः |

एष एवान्तको नाहमित्यासीदन्तकस्य धीः ||८. ६||

The God of death (Yama) saw the annihilation of people by the tyrant
Mahishasura and wondered in his mind whether `Mahishasura is indeed Yama
not me'. ||8.6||

रणे येनातिरस्कृत्य त्यक्तो राक्षस इत्यतः |

चिराय हरिदीशेषु कोणेशः प्राप्तवान्यशः ||८. ७||

The Lord of SouthWest direction, Nirruti enjoyed the high status as `Konesha'
since he was spared from waging war by Mahishasura because he also belonged
to the clan of Rakshasas. ||8.7||

यन्नियन्तुमशक्तस्य कुर्वाणमसतीः क्रियाः |

नियन्तुरसतामासीत्पाशिनो मलिनं यशः ||८. ८||

The fame of Varuna, controller of evil people was tainted because he was
not able to control the evil acts of Mahishasura. ||8.8||

बाहुवीर्यपराभूतो यस्य प्रायेण मारुतः |

बभूव क्षणदान्तेषु रतान्तपरिचारकः ||८. ९||

Vayu was defeated by Mahishasura's valor and perhaps became his servant
when the demon used to sport with his wife in his inner chambers (with
pleasant breeze during the close of night). ||8.9||

निधीन्येन जितो हित्वा राजराजः पलायितः |

स्पष्टं बभाण माधुर्यं प्राणानामखिलादपि ||८. १०||

Kubera, the king of kings, testified the truth of the dictum that `life
is more precious than everything' when he flew away leaving all his valuable
treasures after he was defeated by Mahishasura. ||8.10||

यस्मिन्नुत्तरपूर्वस्या दिश एकादशाधिपाः |

कुण्ठा बभूवुरात्मीयकण्ठोपमितकीर्तयः ||८. ११||

Eleven Rudras of Northeastern regions were defeated by Mahishasura and
their fame became black (tainted) like (the color of) their neck. ||8.11||

The poet brings in comparison with the blue color of Rudra's neck with
the fame turning black. Rudra's neck has turned blue because he consumed
the poison that arose from churning of ocean, Samudramathana. Aja, Eka,
Ahirbhudnya, Pinaki, Maheshwara, Aparajita, Shaad vrishakapi,Trasika, Shabhu,
Harana and Ishwara are eleven Rudras. ||8.11||

निजशुद्धान्तकान्तानामाननैरेव निर्जितम् |

ललज्जे यः पुनर्जित्वा शूरमानी सुधाकरम् ||८. १२||

Valiant Mahishasura, felt ashamed when he defeated the Moon because the Moon
was already defeated by the faces of beautiful ladies of his harem. ||8.12||

The brave persons feel ashamed by their victory over a person who is
already defeated. ||8.12||

बालस्येव क्रीडनकैः प्रवीरैर्यस्य खेलतः |

लीलाकन्दुकधीरासीद्देवे दीधितिमालिनि ||८. १३||

Mahisha used to consider the combats with mighty opponents as only a
child's play. Hence, the radiant Sun in the galaxy was just a ball fit for
play to him. ||8.13||

त्रियामाचरशुद्धान्तभ्रूविलासनिवारणम् |

विष्णोः सुदर्शनं चक्रं यस्य नापश्यदन्तरम् ||८. १४||

Vishnu's weapon, Sudarshana disc that has put an end to the enjoyment of
women in the harem of demons could not make any impact on Mahisha. ||8.14||

महिषं तं महावीर्यं या सर्वसुरदेहजा |

अवधीद्दानवं तस्यै चण्डिकायै नमो नमः ||८. १५||

I offer prayers to Devi Chandika, sprung from the forms of all the gods,
who killed the dreadful demon Mahishasura. ||8.15||

मुखं तवासेचनकं ध्यायं ध्यायं निरन्तरम् |

मृगेन्द्रवाहे कालेन मृडस्त्वन्मुखतां गतः ||८. १६||

Oh, Mother Simhavahini! Shiva meditated upon your most adorable face
incessantly and obtained the form of yours eventually (as Ardhanarishvara). ||
8.16||

कार्तिकीचन्द्रवदना कालिन्दीवीचिदोर्लता |

अरुणाम्भोजचरणा जयति त्रिरुचिः शिवा ||८. १७||

May Devi Shivaa be victorious who has three varied luster. Her face resembles
full moon of Kartika month, arms are like the waves of Yamuna River, and
feet are like red lotus flowers. ||8.17||

Shivaa has three varied luster of three colors viz, white complexion of
her face like moon, arms are black like Yamuna River and feet are red like
lotus flower. Devi's three colors correspond with her three gunas as the
Shruti says, `ajaameekaam lohitashuklakrishnaam'. ||8.17||

यत्ते कचभरः कालो यद्बाहुर्लोकरक्षकः |

युक्तं द्वयं शिवे मध्यस्त्वसन्नाको न नाकराट् ||८. १८||

Oh, Shive! Your heavy tresses are Kaala (black/destroying) and your arms
are there for the protection of the world. Your tender middle portion (waist)
represents heaven along with Lord of the heavens, Indra. ||8.18||

Indra is left with no work as the Goddess herself executes both protection
and destruction. ||8.18||

स्वदेहादेव या देवी प्रदीपादिव दीपिका |

आविर्भभूव देवानां स्तुवतां हर्तुमापदः ||८. १९||

Devi (Koushiki) came into being from her own body like a lamp is ignited
from another glowing lamp when the gods invoked her for relief from their
difficulties. ||8.19||

Description in these verses refers to the Devi's form called Koushiki
mentioned in the twentythird verse of this stabaka.

धैर्यचातुर्यगाम्भीर्यवीर्यसौन्दर्यशालिनीम् |

रत्नं नितम्बिनीजातौ मेनिरे यां सुरासुराः ||८. २०||

The gods as well as demons regarded the Koushiki form of Devi as a precious
gem among womankind. She is gifted with excellent qualities like courage,
proficiency, dignity, strength, and beauty. ||8.20||

यदीयहुङ्कृत्यनले धूम्राक्षोऽभवदाहुतिः |

समाप्तिं भीषणं यावन्नैवावाप विकत्थनम् ||८. २१||

Dhumraksha became the sacrificial offering before he could complete the
selfboasting praises when he heard the inferno of Devi's loud roar `Hum'
in the battle field. ||8.21||

चामुंडाशिवदूत्यौ यत् कले दारुणविक्रमे |

भक्षयामासतुर्मूर्तीः कीर्तिभिः सह रक्षसाम् ||८. २२||

Chamunda and Shivaduti, two fractional forms of Devi are ferocious
warriors. They consumed not only the physical forms of demons but also their
fame. ||8.22||

यस्याः शूले जगामास्तं यशः शुम्भनिशुम्भयोः |

नमामि विमलश्लोकां कौशिकीं नाम तामुमाम् ||८. २३||

I prostrate before Uma called Koushiki of pure glory in whose spear the
fame of Shumbha and Nishumbha came to halt. ||8.22||

यशोदागर्भजननाद् यशोदां गोकुलस्य ताम् |

वन्दे भगवतीं नन्दां विन्ध्याचलनिवासिनीम् ||८. २४||

I bow down to Bhagavati, Nanda Devi, residing in Vindhya Mountains, who
brought fame to Gokula as she took birth in the womb of Yashoda. ||8.24||

Krishna, son of Devaki was taken to Nanda's house out of fear of Kamsa
and the daughter of Yashoda was taken by Vasudeva. It is told in Bhagavata
that Devi had taken birth as the daughter of Yashoda who is known as Nanda
Devi. ||8.24||

अम्बिकामुपतिष्ठन्तामेताश्चण्डीमनुष्टुभः |

प्रसन्नाः साध्वलङ्काराः सिद्धपद्मेक्षणा इव ||८. २५||२००

May these prayers of Mother, composed in Anushtubh meter decorated
with different figures of speech, gratify Devi Chandi (like the heavenly
damsels). ||8.25||

||समाप्तं च द्वितीयं शतकम् ||
