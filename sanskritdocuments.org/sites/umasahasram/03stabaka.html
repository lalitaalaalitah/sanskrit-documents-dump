तनुमध्यावृत्तम्  Tanumadhya meter

सशरीरायाश्च साधनम्  contrivances of Devi in her corporal form

Whether corporal forms of Shiva and Shakti exist or not is discussed in this
stabaka and it is established that they have playfully taken corporal forms.

शुभ्रस्मितलेशो मातुर्मरुतान्नः |

अन्तस्तिमिराणामन्तं विदधातु ||३. १||

May the pure smile of the Mother of Marut gods put an end to our inner
darkness, various kinds of ignorance. ||3.1||

Parameshvara is known as Indra who is the father of Maruts. Shive is Indrani,
Shachi, the power of Indra. ||3.1||

आद्यौ भुवनानां मातापितरौ तौ |

देवासुरमर्त्यैर्वन्द्यावविनिन्द्यौ ||३. २||

Shakti and Shiva are the Mother and Father of all the worlds since the
creation of the universe. They are devoid of any blemish (of worldly matters)
and are worshiped by gods, demons, and men. ||3.2||

ब्रूते पृथगेकस्तौ विग्रहवन्तौ |

आहैकशरीरं द्वन्द्वं कविरन्यः ||३. ३||

Two different opinions about Shiva and Shakti pose an enigma. They are
two distinct forms according to some and they have merged into one entity
according to another view. ||3.3||

शक्तिं तनुशून्यामीशं च पुमांसम् |

वक्ति प्रमदायां सन्देहयुतोऽन्यः ||३. ४||

Some skeptics think that only Ishvara has masculine form and Shakti has
no distinct entity at all. ||3.4||

ईशं च तमेके सन्मात्रमुशन्ति |

ब्रह्मैकमथान्ये गायन्ति न शक्तिम् ||३. ५||

Only Ishvara is regarded as sat svarupa, Existence by some. Others describe
Ishvara as single Supreme entity, Brahman and not Shakti. ||3.5||

Upanishads praise almighty as only Brahman  `eekamevadhvitiiyam Brahma||.' ||
3.5||

केचित्तनुहीनं प्रज्ञायुतमीशम् |

शक्तिं विदुरस्य प्रज्ञामविकुण्ठाम् ||३. ६||

Some people think Ishvara is formless but united with transcendental wisdom
and Shakti is regarded by them as His invincible wisdom. ||3.6||

उक्तं दधतस्तैः केचित् पुनराहुः |

मायातनुबन्धं नाथस्य न शक्तेः ||३. ७||

Pundits with such opinion (as earlier) further say that Ishvara takes playful
form by his own will and there is no role of Shakti in divine play. ||3.7||

नित्यं सशरीरौ येषां पितरौ तौ |

एकोऽप्यथवा तान् प्रत्याह निसर्गः ||३. ८||

Convictions like either only Ishvara or both Ishvara and Parvati to have
physical forms eternally in this world are proved wrong by the nature. ||
3.8||

Nature proves them wrong since no one can have an everlasting physical
body in this world.

मातापितरौ यत् तावेकशरीरौ |

चित्रप्रथनार्था सा काचन लीला ||३. ९||

The divine play of Shiva and Shakti to show their oneness in a single form
is wonderful. ||3.9||

सन्मात्रकथानां कार्ये मनुजादौ

धीस्वान्तविकासः स्यात्कारणहीनः ||३. १०||

Evolution of intelligence and mind would be rendered futile when people
contend that only `Sat (Brahman)' is the origin of the creation of species
like humans. ||3.10||

अद्वैतिभिरन्या मायाऽऽश्रयणीया |

शक्तेरतिरिक्ता सा किं किमु वादैः ||३. ११||

Proponents of advaita philosophy take shelter under the idea that Maya
is the motivation for creation. However, is not that power nothing but
Shakti? ||3.11||

न स्यात् पृथगात्मा शक्तेः किमुपाधेः |

चक्षुः श्रितचित्तेर्विश्वाकृतिता वा ||३. १२||

Does not Shakti have a separate identity? She is the very consciousness,
which is distinct from the universe. Though Atman is allpervading, it becomes
limited when united with adjuncts. ||3.12||

एकान्तविदेहौ तौ चेदतिसूक्ष्मौ |

लीलातनुबन्धाशक्तावभिधेयौ ||३. १३||

If they (Shiva and Shakti) were very subtle and formless, they would not
be capable of taking playful forms at their will. ||3.13||

It has to be concluded that Shiva and Shakti are not capable of taking
corporal forms at their will if we think that they are very subtle and aloof
from all. However, it is not so. They have equal power to assume form and
to discard it. Otherwise, they would not be omnipotent. ||3.13||

भक्ताननुगृह्णन् दिव्याद्भुतलीलः |

तद्विग्रहबन्धो बोध्यो लसदर्थः ||३. १४||

The glorious divine assumption of form at their will for the purpose
of blessing their devotees is marvelous in play. It is full of sparkling
meaning. ||3.14||

What is the motivation for them to take physical form? They have assumed
physical form in order to make itself more accessible to those who seek for
it in devotion. The human mind finds it difficult to have love and attraction
for something intangible, impersonal. It finds easier to approach towards
and focus its attention on a concrete physical form. Each form assumed by
the Divine has its own significance; it is relevant to the truth embodied
in it. They being omnipotent, have all the control. ||3.14||

स्त्रीत्वं यदि नेष्टं पुंस्त्वं कुत इष्टम् |

ना वा किमु नारी न स्यादनुमेया ||३. १५||

When feminine form of Godhead is not aspired, masculine form is not accepted
as well. The same principle should be applied for both. Why feminine form
is not conceivable like male form is conceived? ||3.15||

तस्मात् पितरौ तौ वाच्यौ मतिमन्तौ |

सूक्ष्मावपि भूयो लीलातनुमन्तौ ||३. १६||

Therefore, it should be clearly understood that the wise divine couple
assume corporal forms playfully despite they being infinitesimal. ||3.16||

नास्मत्तनुवत्ते शक्तीश्वरमूर्ती |

एकाऽमृतरूपा त्वन्या प्रणवात्मा ||३. १७||

The forms of Shakti and Ishvara are not like those of ours. While Devi
Uma is nectar Incarnate, Ishvara is Pranava, embodied with knowledge and
primordial sound (Omkara). ||3.17||

दिव्यं घनतेजः कुर्वद् ध्वनिमन्तः |

सम्पश्यदशेषं मूर्तिः प्रणवात्मा ||३. १८||

The divine Light, witness consciousness of the entire universe, creating
sound (nada) in everything is the Pranava form, Shiva. ||3.18||

Pranavaatma Ishvara is the resplendent divine Light that is present in the
entire universe in a very minute form creating imperceptible sound. ||3.18||

दिव्यो घनसोमः स्यंदन् रसमन्तः |

भुञ्जन् भुवनौघं पीयूषशरीरम् ||३. १९||

The divine figure of nectar, Shakti enjoys the internal shower of bliss
of Soma in the universe. ||3.19||

Pavamana Soma is praised as having the form of nectar, amritatma in Veda. ||
3.19||

बोधोऽनवलम्बो दिव्यं खलु तेजः |

मोदः परिशुद्धो दिव्यः खलु सोमः ||३. २०||

Knowledge that is unconditional and unlimited is the divine Light and pure
happiness is indeed Soma. ||3.20||

Principle behind the two forms of Light and Nectar, Pranava and Soma
are told here. Happiness that does not depend upon any external object is
considered as pure happiness. ||3.20||

सोमांशमहोंशौ यातो घनभावम् |

पित्रोर्भुवनानां सङ्कल्पमहिम्ना ||३. २१||

The parts of Soma and Mahat turned into solid forms by the glorious power
of will of father and mother of the universe. ||3.21||

Solid form of Soma is the Moon and solid form of Mahat is the Sun. ||
3.21||

आराधयसीशं तं चिन्मयकायम् |

आनन्दमयाङ्गी त्वम् देवि किलेयम् ||३. २२||

Oh Devi! You are worshipping Ishvara with the form of consciousness. You
are indeed endowed with the form of Bliss. ||3.21||

You worship Shiva with the offering of your blissful form to him. ||3.21||

दिव्यं तव कायं दिव्ये तव वस्त्रे |

दिव्यानि तवाम्ब स्वर्णाभरणानि ||३. २३||

Oh, Mother! Your figure is divine, your garments and gold ornaments are
indeed divine. ||3.23||

Golden color implies divinity. ||3.23||

यद्देवि विलोक्याऽस्यप्राकृतकाया |

युक्तीः समतीता सेयं तव माया ||३. २४||

Oh Devi! Your inexplicable Maya has made it possible to view your divine
form. ||3.24||

नव्यास्तनुमध्याः प्रत्नां तनुमध्याम् |

विद्वत्सदसीमाः सम्यक्प्रथयन्तु ||३. २५||७५

May these new verses composed in Tanumadhya meter bring out the glory of
Uma! The eternal lady (tanumadhya) is in the assembly of wise people. ||
3.25||

The poet aspires that his composition would help getting the proper knowledge
and eradicates misunderstandings about Uma among wise people. ||3.25||
