एकत्रिंशः स्तबकः  31st Stabaka

नामवैभवम्  greatness of chanting names of Devi

उपजातिवृत्तम्  Upajati meter

दरस्मितश्रीकपटा सुपर्व-

स्रोतस्विनी पर्वतजास्यजाता |

पङ्कं मम क्षालयतादशेषं

संसारमग्ने हृदये विलग्नम् ||३१. १||

Here the Mahima, the greatness of Devi has been described.

May the radiant smile of goddess Parvati, the divine river Ganges, wash
off all our sins from our hearts, engrossed in this world of rounds of births
and deaths. ||31.1||

हराट्टहासेन समं मिलित्वा

पित्रेव पुत्रो गुरुणेव शिष्यः |

विभ्राजमानो मम शं करोतु

हासाङ्कुरः केसरिवाहनायाः ||३१. २||

As a father and a son, a teacher and student laugh together, may the smile
of Durga, mounted on the lion, with the loud laughter of Lord Shiva, bring
happiness to me. ||31.2||

It is well known that Lord Shiva's laughter is frightful and smile of
Devi is beautiful. The comparisons of father and son, teacher and disciple
indicate the pacification of Shiva's fierce laughter. ||31.2||

नमश्शिवायै भणत द्विपादो

युष्माकमग्र्यां धिषणां दधत्यै |

आधारचक्रेशितुरम्बिकायै

ब्रह्माण्डचक्रस्य विधायिकायै ||३१. ३||

Oh human beings! Praise Goddess Uma, who has fashioned this universe, the
mother of Lord Ganesha who is stationed in the adharachakra, who possesses
preeminent wisdom, with the words of salutations. Otherwise what is the
difference between animals and human beings? ||31.3||

There are six levels of energy concentration in every human being, starting
from Muladhara to Agna chakra. Muladhara is the base energy level and it
has to be elevated till Agna chakra. ||31.3||

नदन्ति गावोऽपि विशिष्टकाले-

ष्वम्बेति यो नाह्वयते स किं ना |

लक्ष्यं पुनः प्राणवदस्तु सर्वं

सर्वस्य चान्तर्हि पराऽस्ति शक्तिः ||३१. ४||

At the time of milking, even the cows make the sound Amba; is he a human
being who does not call her as mother, though he has received special grace
from her? ||31.4||

A human being is more intelligent and better equipped than animals. Devi is
present in all the living beings in the form of internal energy in them. Hence
it is the prerogative of the humans to realize their inner essence and call
her as mother. ||31.4||

आत्मन्युतान्यत्र विधाय लक्ष्यं

तां शक्तिमाद्यामखिलेषु सुप्ताम् |

यावत्प्रबोधं मुहुराह्वयस्व

प्रबुध्यते सा यदि किन्न्वसाध्यम् ||३१. ५||

(Oh humans), You concentrate on Her, who is present in you and in all the
things other than you, in the form of latent energy (asleep). You awaken her
(make her active), by constant meditation. When she becomes active nothing
is impossible. You can achieve everything. ||31.5||

ये नाम शान्तिं परमां वहन्तो

नामानि शीताचलपुत्रिकायाः |

सङ्कीर्तयन्तो विजने वसन्ति

जयन्ततातादपि ते जयन्ति ||३१. ६||

Those who sing the glories of Parvati living in secluded places, peaceful
in their disposition, are better than Lord Indra, the king of Gods. ||31.6||

The people who meditate on the names of Parvati are lucky, and they lead
a meaningful life. ||31.6||

नामानि सङ्कीर्तयतां जनानां

कारुण्यवत्याः करिवक्त्रमातुः |

पुनर्जनन्या जठरे निवासा-

दायासवत्ता भवतीति मिथ्या ||३१. ७||

Those who sing the names of the compassionate Mother are kept away from
the difficult process of rebirth and are liberated. ||31.7||

पापैस्समन्तात्समभिद्रुतोऽपि

विश्वस्य ते विक्रममस्मि धीरः |

न चेद्रसज्ञे भवती ब्रवीति

नामानि शीतांशुभृतो हतोऽहम् ||३१. ८||

Oh Tongue! Who knows the tastes well, Trusting your valiance I remain
bold. If you are not pronouncing the holy names of the wife of Shiva, I feel
wretched. ||31.8||

Having confidence in the strength of my tongue, I can destroy all my sins
by pronouncing the Devi namas. ||31.8||

देहीति सम्पल्लवदर्पितानां

द्वारेषु घोषं कुरुषे परेषाम् |

भवानि भद्रे भुवनाम्ब दुर्गे

पाहीति नायाति किमम्ब जिह्वे ||३१. ९||

Oh Tongue! You go to the doors of rich people, who are proud of their wealth
and you literally beg them in a loud voice. Why do you not repeat the words
like Bhavani, Lokamata, sarvamangala, Durga, please protect me? ||31.9||

Here approaching the people who are haughty of their little wealth and
begging to them is condemned and praying Devi is praised. ||31.9||

वाक्यानि वक्तुं यदि ते रसज्ञे

रसोज्ज्वलानि व्यसनं गरीयः |

किं वा नमोन्तानि सुधां किरन्ति

नामानि नो सन्ति कुमारमातुः ||३१. १०||

Oh Tongue! Well versed in tasting, if you are deeply interested in reading
the long verses describing Sringara and other rasas, can't you spell out the
names of the mother of Lord Subrahmanya, spreading the heavenly nectar? ||
31.10||

यद् गीयते शैलसुताभिधानं

तदेव बोध्यं सुकृतं प्रधानम् |

अज्ञानिलोकस्य कृते भणन्ति

यज्ञादिपुण्यानि पराणि विज्ञाः ||३१. ११||

It should be known that uttering Devi's names is highly sacred. Only the
ignorant think that performing sacrifices and other sacred acts are means
of attaining purity. ||31.11||

Here it is made clear that meditating on Devi's names is more sacred than
performing sacrifices. ||31.11||

साम्ना प्रयुक्तेन जगद्वशे स्यात्

नाम्ना सदोक्तेन जगद्विनेत्री |

वेदोभयं सम्यगिदं कृती यो

भवे भयं तस्य कुतोऽपि न स्यात् ||३१. १२||

We can win over the whole world by good and pleasing words. It is possible
to control the people by samopaya i.e. negotiation. By continuous meditation
on Devi's names, one can take control of the three worlds. That lucky person
has no fear from anything. ||31.12||

सङ्कीर्तनात्तुष्यति शर्वयोषा

तुष्टा त्वभीष्टं न ददाति नैषा |

इमं त्वविज्ञाय जगत्युपायं

ब्रजन्त्यपायं बहुधा मनुष्याः ||३१. १३||

Shiva's wife Parvati is pleased by meditating on her names. It is not that
she will not fulfill our wishes. Those who do not know this simple fact have
to face dangers in many ways. ||31.13||

भाषे भुजङ्गाभरणप्रियाया

नामानि कामानितरान् विहाय |

अपि प्रपञ्चातिगघोरकृत्यं

करोतु किं मां तरणेरपत्यम् ||३१. १४||

I chant the names of Devi, the wife of Shiva, by keeping away all the other
wishes. Is it possible for Lord Yama, the son of Sun, to harm me? ||31.14||

Yama is the Lord of death in Hindu scriptures. Even death pales into
insignificance before the holy names of Devi. ||31.14||

यज्ञेन दानैः कठिनव्रतैर्वा

सिद्धिं य इच्छेत्स ग्रहीतुमिच्छेत् |

मातुः शयानोऽङ्कतले शशाङ्कं

महेश्वरीं कीर्तयतस्तु सिद्धिः ||३१. १५||

One who wants to attain spiritual success by performing sacrifices, by
being charitable, by observing religious austerities is like wishing for
the moon lying on the lap of one's mother. The easy way to attain the Mother
is to meditate on her names than following difficult means like performing
sacrifices. ||31.15||

रहस्यतन्त्राणि विविच्य दूरं

व्याजं विमुच्य प्रवदामि सारम् |

नामैव कामारिपुरन्ध्रिकायाः

सिद्धेर्निदानं न मखो न दानम् ||३१. १६||

Keeping away the techniques which are difficult to be understood, having
abandoned the falsehood, I am telling you the essence. Do you know what it
is? It is the chanting of the names of Parvati, wife of the enemy of Manmatha,
i.e. Shiva. It is the prime means to attain all the four purusharthas,
values of human life and not sacrifice charity or anything else. ||31.16||

पीयूषमीषन्मधुरं भणन्ति

ये नाम रामाधरपानलोलाः |

कामारिरामाह्वयगानलोलाः

कवीश्वराः काञ्जिकमालपन्ति ||३१. १७||

The poets say that even though the nectar is sweet, it is not as sweet as
the lips of a beautiful lady. Those who are fond of chanting the names of
Devi, say that even the nectar is tasteless like sour gruel. ||31.17||

सुधाघटः कोऽप्यधरो वधूनां

कविस्सुधातोयधरोऽभिधेयः |

अयं सुधावीचिवितानमाली

नामप्रणादो नगकन्यकायाः ||३१. १८||

The lips of the ladies are like the pots of heavenly nectar. The poet
describes the clouds, which give nectar like water. The sound of the chanting
of the names of Devi is like an ocean spreading nectar by its waves. Chanting
and meditating on Devi's names is the greatest pious act one can perform on
this earth, says the author. ||31.18||

सुरालये भातितरां सुधैका

सुधा परा वाचि महाकवीनाम् |

बिम्बाधरे कञ्जदृशां सुधाऽन्या

सुधेतरा नामनि लोकमातुः ||३१. १९||

Nectar is considered superior in the heaven. Other nectar resides in the
words of great poets. Another kind of nectar shines in the lips of beautiful
women. The nectar contained in the chanting of Devi's names is completely
different from all these because it can secure the release from the bondage
of births and deaths. ||31.19||

माधुर्यमाभात्यधरे वधूनां

चकोरबन्धोः शकले प्रसादः |

त्रिस्रोतसो वारिणि पावनत्वं

त्रयं च नाम्नि त्रिपुराम्बिकायाः ||३१. २०||

Sweetness resides in the lips of young women. Splendor of the moon phases
is pleasing. Purity resides in the river Ganges. However all the three are
present in the names of Devi. ||31.20||

या माधुरी प्रेमभरेण दष्टे

जागर्ति कान्तावरदन्तचेले |

सा दृश्यते भक्तिभरेण गीते

धराधराधीशसुताभिधाने ||३१. २१||

The sweet taste that a person enjoys by kissing a loving woman can also
be enjoyed by a devotee chanting the names of Parvati, the daughter of King
of mountains. ||31.21||

यत्ते जगल्लम्पटकेऽपि वर्णा-

स्तन्मेऽमृतं नाम नगात्मजायाः |

लालामयो यो मम तं ब्रवीषि

सुधामयं स्त्रीदशनच्छदं त्वम् ||३१. २२||

Those who are attached to this world, find the names of Devi just letters,
however they are nectar to me. Some think that the saliva in the mouth is
rasa, however to me; letters of the names of Devi are rasa. So we stand
opposite in comprehending the real rasa. ||31.22||

उच्चारयोच्चाटितपातकानि

नामानि जिह्वे भुवनस्य मातुः |

तदा वदामो मधुचूतरम्भा-

रामाधरास्ते रुचये यदि स्युः ||३१. २३||

Oh Tongue! Throw away all the sins and chant her names. She is the Mother
of the universe. The purported sweet things like mango, banana, honey, lips
of a beautiful woman etc., will become tasteless if you start singing and
chanting Devi's names. ||31.23||

The worldly tastes are tasteless when compared to Devi's names. ||31.23||

All types of nectar mentioned so far are beset with some or the other
fault. Only the nectar of Devi's names excels. ||31.24||

विश्वासहीनैः सुतरामबोध्यं

नामानुभावं नगकन्यकायाः |

जयन्तु सिद्धैरपि गीयमानं

गायन्त्य एता उपजातयो नः ||३१. २५||७७५

Those who have no trust in Her names are really unable to understand
the power of chanting, which is praised even by Siddhas and other heavenly
beings. May these prayers set to Upajati meter be victorious. ||31.25||
