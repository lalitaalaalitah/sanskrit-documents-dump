षड्विंशः स्तबकः  26th Stabaka

अपीतकुचाम्बा  Goddess Apitakuchamba

दोधकवृत्तम्  dodhaka meter

In this stabaka the author eulogies the gracious goddess Apitakuchambika
residing in the holy mountain Arunachala, in dodhaka meter comprised of
eleven syllables in each quarter with three bhaganas (a bhagana is a group
of three syllables with a guru (long vowel) in the beginning) followed by
two short vowels dodhakavruttamidam bhabhabhagow.

आगमविन्मतिकैरविणीनां

बोधमजस्रमसौ विदधानः |

पातु महेशवधूवदनांशो

हासशशी सकलानि कुलानि ||२६. १||

May this smilemoon, a composite of the face of Lord Mahesha's spouse
bestowing eternal knowledge(always causing to bloom) to the intellectlotuses of
the knowers of Agamas (Vedas and other Shastras) protect all the families. ||
26.1||

The compound hasashashi, hasa eva shashi smile only is the moon, contains
Parinamalankara. ||26.1||

आयतलोचनचुम्बितकर्णा

दानयशोजिततोयदकर्णा |

शोणनगेशमनः प्रियवर्णा

नाशयताज्जगदार्तिमपर्णा ||२६. २||

May the goddess Aparna who is endowed with the ears kissed by the long
eyes (with the eyes extending up to the tip of the ears), who vanquished
cloud like Karna in fame earned by benevolence (the fame munificence of
the goddess excelled that of Karna, who is disposed to grant the desires
of the supplicants) and who gratifies the mind of the Lord of Arunachala,
destroy the affliction of the world. ||26.2||

The word shonanagesha in the verse means Arunachala. ||26.2||

वेदतुरङ्गविलोचनभाग्यं

वेदशिरोनिचयैरपि मृग्यम् |

शोकविदारिसुधाकिरणास्यं

शोणगिरौ समलोकि रहस्यम् ||२६. ३||

The mystery in Arunachala was seen by me the mystery (in the form of)
the fruit of merit of the eyes of Shiva to whom the Vedas were horses,
which is to be sought even by the heaps of crest jewels of Vedas (Vedanta)
and which has the face like the moon accustomed to remove the pain. ||26.3||

There is a Purana story that on the occasion of Tripura samhara when Shiva
waged a war against the demons, Vedas became the horses and on that account,
Shiva is called Tripurari. ||26.3||

मुञ्च समस्तमनोरथलाभे

संशयमद्य करामलकाभे |

दृक्पथमाप नगेन्द्रतनूजा

सोऽहमितः परमन्तरराजा ||२६. ४||

Do not entertain doubt Oh mind, today with regard to the fulfillment of
all desires akin to the fruit of myrobalan on hand. The daughter of the lord
of mountains (Himavan) viz., Parvati is within the range of sight. That I
(having obtained the vision of the goddess) am henceforth the one in whose
heart is the Lord need no longer dependent on any outsider. ||26.4||

Herein, the phrase Karagatamalakam is proverbial. It means a handy thing
easily obtainable without much effort. This contains the figure called
lokokti. ||26.4||

शिल्पविदः प्रतिमां प्रविशन्ती

स्वल्पविदां तरणाय चकास्ति |

शोणधराभृति सम्प्रति लब्धा

हन्त चिरादियमेव ममाम्बा ||२६. ५||

The goddess entering the icon fashioned by the expert of iconography (by her
ingenuity) shines forth for the sake of dullards (who are not conversant with
the Vedas and sastras) in order to cross over the ocean of Metempsychosis. I
got her now in Arunachala. Oh ! She alone is my mother forever (hither to
I spent my life not knowing her; having known her now I have her). ||26.5||

भारतभूवलयेऽत्र विशाले

सन्त्वनघानि बहूनि गृहाणि |

आस्यविगीतसुधाकरबिम्बा

शोणगिरौ रमतेऽत्र मदम्बा ||२६. ६||

In this extensive land of Bharata there may be many auspicious abodes
(temples for the goddess to live). Nevertheless here in the Arunachala my
mother whose countenance has censured the disc of the moon (the pleasant
face of the goddess has excelled the moon in radiance) revels. ||26.6||

The stanza purports to mean that there are innumerable beautiful and holy
places of the goddess in the entire country. Yet the goddess is joyfully
enamored of this habitant only. ||26.6||

वारितसंश्रितपातकजाला

वारिधिवीचिनिरङ्कुशलीला |

वारिजपत्रविडम्बननेत्रा

वारणराजमुखेन सपुत्रा ||२६. ७||

She by whom is removed the net of sins of the people who have sought asylum
in her, who is endowed with unimpeded grace like the successive waves of
the ocean, who is possessed with the eyes resembling the lotus petals is
also the mother of Gajamukha (may her protect us). ||26.7||

आयतवक्रघनासितकेशी

तोयजबाणरिपोर्हृदयेशी |

काशसुमाच्छयशाः परमैषा

पाशभिदस्तु तवेन्दुविभूषा ||२६. ८||

Possessed with long, curly thick and black hair, the Mistress of the heart
of the enemy of cupid god, with the fame as white as Kasa flower (a species of
grass Saccharum)  may this salutary goddess with the moon as her crest jewel
cut asunder your noose of births and deaths caused by ignorance. ||26.8||

The epithet Toyajabanaripoh means the enemy of cupid god possessing the
five arrows of flower. ||26.8||

पङ्कजसम्भवपूजितपादा

पङ्कविनाशनपावननामा |

किङ्करकल्पलता परमेयं

शङ्करनेत्रसुधा शरणं नः ||२६. ९||

She, whose feet are worshipped by the god Brahma, whose holy name destroys
the evil, who is the creeper of divine tree to the servants (benefactor
of devotees' wishes like the creeper of wish fulfilling tree Kalpavrksha),
the nectar (soothing) to the eyes of Shankara is our refuge. ||26.9||

Pankajasambhavalotusborn; means Brahma, the creator God, who according
to the purana, has taken birth in the lotus stemming out of the navel of
Mahavishnu. ||26.9||

चञ्चलदृग्विनतामरवल्ली

पञ्चपृषत्कशरासनझिल्ली |

काञ्चनगर्भमुखप्रणुतेयं

पञ्चमुखप्रमदा शरणं नः ||२६. १०||

The goddess with vivacious eyes is the wishyielding divine creeper to those
who bow down her. She, being endowed with the eyebrows in the form of a bow
to the cupid god being praised by Brahma and others, and who is the beloved
woman of the five faced god Parameswara, is our protector. ||26.10||

Pancamukha five faces of the Lord Parameswara, whose spouse is Parvati,
are Isana, Tatpurusa, Aghora, Vamadeva and Sadyojata. ||26.10||

अम्ब विधूय भटान्मदनादीन्

नूपुरनादबिभीषिकयैषः |

हन्त जहार बलेन मनो मे

शोणनगाङ्घ्रिनिवासिनि तेऽङ्घ्रिः ||२६. ११||

Oh, Mother! Dwelling at the base of Arunachala! This foot of yours having
kicked off the soldier in the form of Kama and others, and threatening
through the sound of your anklet captivates my mind. ||26.11||

Notes: The soldiers here are Kamadesire; Krodhaanger; Lobhaavarice;
Mohainfatuation; Madaarrogance; and Matsarajealousy; otherwise called
arishadvarga, group of six foes. ||26.11||

कर्णपुटे कुरु मुग्ध ममोक्तिं

मुञ्च धनादिषु मानससक्तिम् |

शोणगिरीन्द्रवधूपदभक्तिं

शीलय शीलय यास्यसि मुक्तिम् ||२६. १२||

Oh bewildered mind! Make my speech reach the ears. Abandon the attachment
to money and the sensual pleasures. Practice constant devotion towards
the foot of the beloved wife of the Lord of Arunachala. You shall obtain
liberation. ||26.11||

जीर्णतरे जरयाऽखिलदेहे

बुद्धिबलं च विलुम्पति मोहे |

हन्त सवित्रि तपन्मतिरन्ते

सेवितुमिच्छति ना चरणं ते ||२६. १३||

Oh, Mother! When the whole body is withered due to old age and delusion
is seizing the strength of intellect, a man with distressing intellect at
the last moment (at the time of death) longs to worship thy foot. ||26.13||

The suggestion here is that when the body and sense organs are active
and alert man is not disposed to worship the feet of the goddess. However,
he thinks of her at the last moment. This is deplorable indeed. ||26.13||

तन्त्रविदो नवयोनि तु चक्रं

शोणधराधररूपमुशन्ति |

अर्धममुष्य वपुर्मदनारे-

रर्धमगेन्द्रसुते तव गात्रम् ||२६. १४||

The experts of the Tantras regard Arunagiri in the form of Srichakra. Of
this Srichakra form of the mount, one half is the body of Lord Shiva (the
enemy of cupid god). Oh Parvati, the daughter of the mountain Lord! Thy body
is its other half. ||26.14||

Notes: Tantras are a class of treatises called Agamas such as Saktagamas
teaching mystical and magical formulae. In the Tantrashastra the wellknown
Srichakra is termed as Sripura. It is believed that the same manifests as
Arunagiri. In this form too the two halves of the divine couple Shiva and
Parvati appear distinctly. ||26.14||

अस्तु नगेश्वरनन्दिनि लिङ्गं

तैजसमेतदिहापि तवांशः |

वीतगुणस्य विना तव योगं

देवि शिवस्य कुतः खलु तेजः ||२६. १५||

Oh, Parvati! The daughter of the lord of mountains! This linga (called
Arunachala) is luminous due to thy presence. Oh Goddess! Where forth is the
light to Shiva, the attribute less without your association? ||26.15||

The attribute less supreme soul Paramapurusha, becomes attributive only
in conjunction with Shakti, female energy. While light is a quality guna,
the luminous linga is a substance, gunipadarthadravya. Without the quality
of light, tejas, the luminosity taijasatva of the (qualified) linga is not
established. ||26.15||

There is pun on the words guna and tejas. As the 1st half of the verse is
substantiated by the 2nd half there is the figure Kavyalinga. ||26.15||

स्थापितमूर्तिरियं तव नम्या

पूजयितुं जगदीश्वरि रम्या |

शोणनगार्धमिदं तव रूपं

कीर्तयितुं नगजे धुतपापम् ||२६. १६||

Oh Ruler of the Universe! This carved idol of yours worthy of salutation is
beautiful to worship. Oh, the daughter of Himavan! This pure form comprising
the half of Arunachala of yours is charming and worthy of chanting. ||
26.16||

Notes: Parvati's form endowed with hands and other limbs as carved by
the sculptor is charming for corporeal worship, kayikapujana; whereas the
mountainous form is delightful for vocal worship, vacikapujana. Mental worship,
manasikapujana is common to both. ||26.16||

शोणनगार्धतनोऽनिशमङ्के

धारयसेऽयि गुहं रमणाख्यम् |

आगतमप्ययि हा मुहुरम्बो-

च्चाटयसे गणपं ननु कस्मात् ||२६. १७||

Oh Goddess! The better half of Arunachala! You are holding Guha called
Ramana on thy lap always. Oh, Mother! Wherefore you drive away Ganapati who
keeps coming to you repeatedly though. ||26.17||

Notes: You fondle the younger son making him sit on your lap but you
keep away your elder son. Why asks the poet. It suggests that Bhagavan
Ramanamaharshi resides at the foothill. ||26.17||

अङ्कजुषे रमणाय नु दातुं

मानववेषधराय गुहाय |

शोणनगार्धतनो बहु दुग्धं

मातरपीतकुचेह विभासि ||२६. १८||

Oh the wife of Shonanaga, Mother! Are you presiding radiantly in this
holy place as goddess Apitakuca, (whose breast milk has not been drunk),
in order to pour abundant milk to Ramana, who is Guha assuming the human
form adorning your lap? ||26.18||

पूर्णसमाधिवशात् स्वपिषि त्वं

पीतमपीतकुचेऽम्ब न वेत्सि |

अङ्कजुषा रमणेन सुतेन

प्रेक्ष्य यथेष्टमुरोरुहदुग्धम् ||२६. १९||

Oh, Mother Apitakuca! You are sleeping under the spell of total trance
(forgetting the entire eternal world). (Therefore) You do not know the breast
milk being drunk at pleasure by your son Ramana seated on the lap. ||26.19||

ज्ञानरसाह्वयमम्ब निपीय

स्तन्यमसौ रमणो मुनिराट् ते |

ज्ञानमयोऽभवदीश्वरि सर्वः

पुष्यति येन तनुं हि तदात्मा ||२६. २०||

Mother Ishwari! Ramana residing in the hill, the best of ascetics,
having abundantly drunk your breast milk called the nectar of knowledge has
become sarva no different from the self of all, Sarvatma of the nature of
knowledge. ||26.20||

प्रीतिपदाय पयोधरकुम्भात्

पार्वति धीमयदुग्धमपीतात् |

अस्तु गुहाय शिवे बहु दत्तं

किञ्चिदिवेश्वरि धारय मह्यम् ||२६. २१||

Oh Parvati! May boundless milknectar of knowledge from thy undrunk pitcher
of breast be given to Guha, thy affectionate child. Oh Shive! May you be
pleased as well to give at least a little to me, thy child. ||26.21||

प्रौढमिमं यदि वेत्सि तनूजं

शैलसुते मदवारि दधानम् |

मास्तुपयो वितरानघमन्नं

येन दधानि महेश्वरि शक्तिम् ||२६. २२||

Oh Parvati! If you think this son Ganapati, is grownup (with ichor
flowing from his temple region) then not feeding me with milk. Give me, Oh
Maheswari! The most excellent food, from which, I may derive strength. ||
26.22||

स्वार्जितमेव मया यदि भोज्यं

सम्मद एव ममाखिलमातः |

आशिषमग्र्यतमामयि दत्त्वा

प्रेषय यानि जयानि धरित्रीम् ||२६. २३||

Oh Mother of the Universe! If you say that I have to eat the food earned
only by me then it is agreeable to me. However, Oh, Mother! Send me to the
earth having pronounced the choicest blessings on me so that I shall be
victorious. ||26.23||

विद्युति विद्युति वीक्ष्यविलासा

वीक्षितकर्मणि लक्ष्यरहस्या |

पार्वणचन्द्रमुखी ललिताङ्गी

तैजसलिङ्गसखी शरणं नः ||२६. २४||

She, the beloved of the Lord of Arunachala, Taijasalinga, who has the gleam
sport visible in each flash of lightning, whose secret is discernible in
her vision, which is lovely endowed with the face resembling the full moon,
is our rescuer. ||26.24||

मातरपीतकुचेऽरुणशैला-

धीश्वरभामिनि भामहनीये |

साधु विधाय समर्पयते ते

दोधकमाल्यमिदं गणनाथः ||२६. २५||६५०

Oh Mother Apitakuca! The consort of the presiding Lord of Arunachala of
glorious splendor! Gananatha is offering this beautiful wreath of Dodhaka
composition (May you are pleased to accept). ||26.25||

Gananatha is the poet Ganapati. Dodhaka is the name of the meter in which
these verses are composed. ||26.25||
