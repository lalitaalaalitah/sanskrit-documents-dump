श्रीमन्ति कुर्वन्तु जगन्ति भासः ||५. १||

May the radiance of the sprouts of smile of the consort of Srikantha,
which are acting like the decorative sandalwood paste on the cheeks of her
friends, make the world prosperous. ||5.1||

Here, the poet describes the smiling face of newlywed Uma, which carries
many romantic narrations to her friends, making them blush. ||5.1||

कीर्तिर्वलक्षा कुसुमायुधस्य

The radiance of the smile of Gajanana's (of two faces) mother indicates
the pure fame of cupid god achieved by his great triumph over Shiva who has
golden mountain Meru for his bow. May that smile give you prosperity for
long. ||5.2||

Cupid god, Manmatha was successful with his arrows of flowers against
Shiva who has solid mountain Meru for his bow. Cupid's pure fame refers to
his success in uniting Shiva and Parvati in matrimony (parinaya) even though
he was turned into ashes by Shiva. ||5.2||

प्रमथ्यमानामृतराशिवीचि-

प्रोद्गच्छदच्छाच्छतुषारकल्पाः |

Gentle smiles of the mother of Vighnesha are very pure like pure chilly
water drops of waves spurting out of rapid churning of milky ocean. May

महेश्वरीहासलवप्रकाशः ||५. ४||

The glow of Maheshwari's inexplicable pleasant smile like moonlight, a feast
to the eyes of Maheshwara may fulfill the desires of our hearts. ||5.4||

Maheshwara's eyes are happy and contended with the sight of Maheshwari's
sweet smile filled with tranquility like the guests who are pleased with good
hospitality. Moonlight implies tranquility, cooling, and nucleus of nectar
(shanti, sheetala,, and amritagarbha). ||5.4||

वलक्षवक्षोजपटाञ्चलेन

चलेन सार्धं कृतकेलयो नः |

पुरत्रयारातिकलत्रहास-

भासो निरासं विपदां क्रियासुः ||५. ५||

The luster of the smiles of the spouse of the Enemy of three cities, which
is playing with the moving edge of white upper garment covering her breasts,
may put an end to our troubles. ||5.5||

येषां त्विषो बिभ्रति दिग्वधूटी-

गण्डेषु कर्पूरपरागलीलाम् ||५. ६||

May the soothing smiles of Shiva's beautiful wife remove our misery. The
luster of those smiles bears the elegance of camphor dust on the cheeks of
womenquarters (quarters as women). ||5.6||

Here, all the directions are compared with women and Uma's smile is compared
to a cosmetic that enhances the beauty of women. ||5.6||

कुर्वन्तु कामं सफलं त्व मदीयं

कुलाद्रिकन्याहसितानि तानि |

येषां मयूखैः क्रियते सिताद्रेर्-

उद्यानवाटीषु नवो वसन्तः ||५. ७||

The rays of laughter of the daughter of the great mountains create new spring
in the gardens of Himalayas. May those laughters grant my desires. ||5.7||

आम्रेडितं भूषणचन्द्रभासां

नासाविभूषामहसां द्विरुक्तिः |

पुरारिनारीस्मितकान्तयो मे

पूर्णानि कुर्वन्तु समीहितानि ||५. ८||

The luster of the smiles of the lady of Purari, Shiva, is the recurrence of
the luster of Moon, being the ornament of Shiva and is also the recurrence
of the luster of her nose ornament. May those rays of luster of her smiles
fulfill my desires. ||5.8||

निर्माय विश्वालयमम्ब शर्व-

स्त्वया समं शिल्पविदा स शिल्पी |

विहर्तुमिच्छन्नयि वोढुमैच्छ-

न्नारीं भवन्तीं पुरुषो भवंस्त्वाम् ||५. ९||

Sharva, being a sculptor par excellence, created the universe along with
you who is skilled in the art. Subsequently Oh, Mother! He assumed the form
of male and you as female for divine play. ||5.9||

दिव्यं दुकूलं धवलं दधाना

वेण्या फणीन्द्रोपमया लसन्ती |

प्रफुल्लराजीवविलोचना त्वं

प्रपञ्चभर्तुर्नयनान्यहार्षीः ||५. १०||

Oh, Mother! Having eyes like fully bloomed lotus, wearing white divine
robes and shining with braid like snake, you have stolen the eyes of Shiva
the Lord of the Universe. ||5.10||

प्रत्यङ्गबन्धं ज्वलदुत्तमं ते

भुजङ्गराजोपमवेणिरूपम् |

आत्मैकनिष्ठस्य च विश्वभर्तुर्-

आराधयामास विलोचनानि ||५. ११||

Every limb of your body being resplendent along with your braid as if the
king of snakes was pleasant to the (three) eyes of the Lord of the Universe
even though he is known to be in constant communion with Self. ||5.11||

अभूस्त्वमाद्यस्य मनोमदाय

स चापि ते प्रीतिपदं बभूव |

न केवलं वां सकलस्य चासी-

द्दाम्पत्यबन्धस्य तदम्ब बीजम् ||५. १२||

Oh, Mother! You were cherished dearly by the First man who came into being
in this universe and he also became your dearest. Your union in matrimony
initiated the institution of marriage in this world. ||5.12||

तवातिकान्ता नयानान्तवृत्ति-

र्हासः पुरारेश्च नवेन्दुहारी |

उभौ विवाहोत्सवपूर्वरङ्गं

निर्वर्तयामासतुरादिरामे ||५. १३||

Oh, beautiful primordial woman, your captivating sideglances and the
beautiful smile like the rising Moon of Shiva, together created the prelude
(purvaranga) for your wedding ceremony. ||5.13||

दातुं प्रभुः सान्त्वयितुं समर्थः

कर्तुं क्षमस्तर्जयितुं च शक्तः |

संरक्षतान्मां तव सर्ववन्द्ये

करस्तुषारांशुभृता गृहीतः ||५. १४||

Oh, Mother! Your hand held (in matrimony) by Shiva is affluent in granting
aspirations and capable of consoling the devotees. It has the competence to
do all the work and is also able to intimidate (enemies). Oh Devi! Revered
by all, may your hand protect me. ||5.14||

स्प्रष्टुं न शक्या परमे परैस्त्वं

स चान्यया चिन्तयितुं न शक्यः |

त्वमेव शर्वस्य स एव तेऽम्ब

दाम्पत्यमेवं युवयोस्तु सत्यम् ||५. १५||

Oh, Mother! You cannot be desired (touched) by any other than Shiva and He
also cannot be approached by anyone else as spouse. You belong to him and He
belongs to you. Only your union in matrimony is the eternal truth. ||5.15||

Matrimony of Shiva and Shakti is the only true bondage since Shiva is the
origin of all the men (species) and Shakti is the origin of all the women
(species) in this world. ||5.15||

निजाद्वतंसेन्दुत इन्दुमन्य-

मुत्पाद्य ते शम्भुरदाद्वतंसम् |

मूर्तामिवासौ शुभगात्रि रात्रिं

प्राप्य त्वदीयां कबरीं चकासे ||५. १६||

Oh, deity with auspicious limbs! Lord created another moon from the crescent
moon, which is on his head and presented him to you as an ornament. The
moon gifted to you is shining on your dark braided hair, which is the very
embodiment of night as it were. ||5.16||

बभूविथागेन्द्रगृहे यदा त्वं

स चेश्वरस्तत्र चकार वासम् |

विलोकमानस्तव देवि विद्युत्

पाञ्चालिकायाः कमनीयभावम् ||५. १७||

Your Lord was watching your enchanting form, which appears like a dazzling
doll of lightning when He stayed in the Himalayas, the king of mountains
with you in your father's house. ||5.17||

सिद्धं स वां साधयितुं प्रवृत्तो

योगं प्रदग्धो मदनश्च कल्पे |

वशीति कीर्तिं गिरिशस्य भर्तुं

तुभ्यं त्वपर्णेति यशश्च कर्तुम् ||५. १८||

Oh, Mother! It is well known that Cupid was burnt to ashes in his efforts
to unite you both (who are already united). Eventually, Shiva earned the
fame as devoted to you and you got your famous title as Aparna. ||5.18||

Parvati is known as Aparna because she stopped eating even leaves when
she was doing penance for obtaining Shiva as her husband. Kalidasa also has
referred this in his famous epic `Kumarasambhavam'. ||5.18||

घोरं तपश्चेद्रचितं त्वयाऽपि

प्राग्रूपभर्तुः समनुग्रहाय |

विहाय यत्नं क इहाखिलाऽम्ब

सम्बद्धमप्यर्थमुपैतु जन्तुः ||५. १९||

Oh Mother of all! You went through an ordeal of severe penance to obtain
favor of Shiva who was your husband (in previous birth). How can anyone in
this world obtain any desired object without efforts? ||5.19||

Parvati's great penance for Shiva, despite the fact that she was his wife
Sati in her previous birth, is well known. ||5.19||

ज्वलत्कपर्दो दहनाङ्कभालः

कपालमाली करिकृत्तिवासाः |

भुजङ्गभूषो भसिताङ्गरागः

पुष्पेषु वैरी परुषाट्टहासः ||५. २०||

Shiva being an enemy of cupid god has all the odds like tuft (jatajuta) on
his head, a mark of fire on his forehead, a garland of skulls and clothing
of elephant leather. He is decorated by serpents, uses ashes as cosmetic,
and his laughter is very hoarse. ||5.20||

श्मशानवासी पुरुषस्त्रिशूली

जहार ते चेदनघाङ्गि चेतः |

दृष्टान्तमर्थोऽयमवाप नैव

प्रीतिर्बहिःकारणमाश्रितेति ||५. २१||

Oh Sinless Divine Lady! We have to agree with the saying that love does
not depend upon external features; when we see this person with a trident
in his hand and whose abode is burial ground has stolen your mind. ||5.21||

रूपं पुरारेरथवा तदेतत्

सेयं च चेष्टा समयान्तरेषु |

कान्तं वपुः कान्ततराश्च लीला-

स्त्वया समं खेलितुमेष धत्ते ||५. २२||

Perhaps whatever is described above is an occasional form of Shiva. He
assumes a pleasing form with more pleasing manners when he has a pleasurable
time with you. ||5.22||

प्रहृष्टयक्षः समवेतसिद्धो

नृत्यद्गणेन्द्रो विकसन्मुनीन्द्रः |

भूयोऽपि योगो युवयोर्हिमाद्रौ

बभार मातर्महमद्वितीयम् ||५. २३||

Oh, Mother! Yakshas were happy, Siddhas assembled, all the ganas (Shivagana)
danced, and sages were delighted when the union of you and Shiva took place
again with unparalleled pomp and merriment on the Himalaya Mountains. ||
5.23||

It refers to Shiva's union with Shakti for the second time on Himalayas
when Sati took rebirth as Parvati. ||5.23||

महेश्वरस्त्वां परिणीय लेभे

यावात्मजौ द्वावनघाङ्गि मुख्यौ |

एकस्तयोर्भ्राम्यति विश्वमत्तुं

भूभृत्तटीराश्रयते बतान्यः ||५. २४||

Oh Sinless Lady! Shiva got two great sons after marrying you. One of them,
Ganesha, wanders in the whole world to consume and the other, Shanmukha,
takes shelter in the valleys of the mountains. ||5.24||

Ganapati wanders in the world to bless the devotees by consuming obstacles
in their endeavors and Shanmukha, stationed in valleys (hearts) bestows
knowledge to his devotees. ||5.24||

सङ्कीर्तयन्त्यो जगतां जनन्याः

कल्याणवार्ताः कमनीयकीर्तेः |

इमाः प्रमोदाय सतां भवन्तु

सन्दर्भशुद्धा उपजातयो नः ||५. २५||१२५

May these verses in Upajati meter suitable for extolling the enchanting
anecdotes of the wedding of the Mother of worlds with Shiva please the
learned people. ||5.25||
