ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3></b></center>
<UL><UL>
<P>
We deeply appreciate Dr. S.R. Leela, Chief Translator, and Dr. Jayanthi
Manohar, Cotranslator and their dedicated and scholarly efforts in translating
the Magnum Opus Umasaharam. Without their enthusiasm, and dedication,
this translation would not have been accomplished. Dr. Leela tirelessly
coordinated, and directed translations. We cannot thank enough of these
translators and their patience and affection by putting up with constant
bombardment of emails and phone calls. We humbly bow to them and Goddess
Saraswati manifested in them in living form.
<P>
We sincerely acknowledge Ramanashram, Dr. S.P. Pani, and Dr. Sampadananda
Mishra for their gracious permission to include copyrighted paragraphs from
The Collected Works of Vasishtha Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni (Reference  4). They
also granted initial permission at the onset of Umasahsram translation. We
greatly appreciate their encouragement and continued support.
<P>
We also acknowledge Mr. Sharada Prasad  Principal at Srivani School, Bangalore,
and his wife, Nalini, who introduced us to Shatavadhani Dr. R Ganesh who
in turn recommended  Dr. Leela for translation project. Mr. Prasad also
coordinated first meeting with Dr. Leela in early 2010.
<P>
Our thanks are due to Dr. Sunder Hattangadi for providing additional
proofreading support.
<P>
We sincerely thank volunteers at sanskritdocuments.org and surasa.net
websites for their encouragement, timely support, and hosting the ebook online.
<P>
We are humbled and offer our obeisance with utmost gratitude to Divine Mother,
all the Gurus, and Acharyas for their boundless blessings for this project.
