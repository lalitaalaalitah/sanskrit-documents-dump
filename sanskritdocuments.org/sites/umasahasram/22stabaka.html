द्वाविंशः स्तबकः  22nd Stabaka

हरकुटुम्बकम्  Shiva and his supernatural familय्

वियोगिनीवृत्तम्  viyogini meter

अखिलस्य विकासकारणं व्यसनिज्ञानिजनावनेषु नः |

वितनोतु विशेषतः शिवं शिवराजीवदृशो दरस्मितम् ||२२. १||

Like the previous stabakas, the present one also begins with praise to
Devi. May the gentle smile of the supreme Goddess, consort of Lord Shiva,
bless us with special favor; the smile, which is the cause of the unfoldment
of this universe, and which always is intent on protecting the good and the
learned. ||22.1||

It is in the nature of the universe to go to a static state; the bright
smile of the Devi causes the same to wake up from the slumber and propels
it to move towards progress. ||22.1||

विकले सकले सुरव्रजे व्रजति श्यामलिमानमच्युते |

जगतस्सदयो हलाहलं चुलुकीकृत्य भयं नुनोद यः ||२२. २||

As the terrified group of gods was running haphazardly here and there;
even as the great Lord Vishnu had become pale, it is the compassionate Lord
Hara who drank the halahala, the deadly poison, confining it to his neck
region and removed the fear of the world. ||22.2||

निगमैस्तुरगी भुवा रथी विधिना सारथिमान् बिभेद यः |

कनकाद्रिवरेण कार्मुकी कमलाक्षेण शरी पुरत्रयम् ||२२. ३||

With Vedas for his horses, Earth for his chariot, Lord Brahma for his
charioteer Mount Meru for his bow, Lord Vishnu for his arrow, the great
warrior, Lord Shiva, vanquished Tripura. ||22.3||

अजितस्य च गाढमत्सरैः कमलाकान्तपुरस्सरैस्सुरैः |

पदजायुधधारया रयाद्वधमाधत्त जलन्धरस्य यः ||२२. ४||

Along with the host of gods lead by leaders such as Vishnu, who were deeply
jealous of the asuras, Lord Shiva destroyed the powerful asura, Jalandhara,
using nails of his toes as sharp weapons. ||22.4||

The story of Jalandhara is found in the Lingapurana. He was called Jalandhara
as he was born in watersjala. He had become almost invincible by his tapas
and had obtained boons by Brahma. ||22.4||

कमलासनकञ्जलोचनौ छललिङ्गस्य शिरोङ्घ्रि वीक्षितुम् |

बत हंसवराहभूमिकौ यतमानावपि यस्य न प्रभू ||२२. ५||

Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu tried their best to find out the head and
foot of Lord Iswara in the linga form by putting on the form of swan and
boar respectively (swan searching from the top and the boar digging below);
but did not succeed in their mission. ||22.5||

Lord Ishwara is anadi and ananta. Even the creator and sustainer could
not know the mystery of the Lord's existence. This story is also found in
the Lingapurana. ||22.5||

नयनं निटलान्तरस्थितं विघटय्येषदिवान्वितो रुषा |

भुवनत्रयनिर्जयोन्नतं मदनं गाढमदं ददाह यः ||२२. ६||

It is the Great God Iswara who burnt down cupid by opening his third eye
(in the forehead) which was only a little red with indignation. Cupid or
Kama had become extremely haughty due to the fact that he had subdued the
three worlds. ||22.6||

सकले धवलः कलेबरे हरिनीलोपलमञ्जुलः क्वचित् |

अमृतांशुरिवादधाति यः परमामक्षिमुदं प्रपश्यताम् ||२२. ७||

With a fair and bright complexion mixed with the color of the blue diamonds
in some places (like the neck), he presents a delightful sight to the on
lookers like that of the nectarrayed moon. ||22.7||

अवतंसतुषारदीधितिद्युतिभिर्यस्य यशोभरैरपि |

सममच्छतरीकृतो दिशामवकाशस्सुतरां प्रकाशते ||२२. ८||

Just as it is with the white rays of the moon, his crestornaments and his
fame as well, the space in between the directions appear bright indeed. ||
22.8||

Fame is always conceived as bright white in color in poetic imagination. ||
22.8||

गगनानलजीवनानिलक्षितिसोमारुणसोमयाजिभिः |

महतो बत यस्य मूर्तिभिर्भुवनं क्रान्तमिदं समन्ततः ||२२. ९||

How wonderful it is! That this whole world is occupied by the eight forms
of the Lord viz., space (akasa), fire (anala), water(Jivana), air (anila),
earth (kshiti), moon, sun and the yajamana(atmaself). ||22.9||

सह तेन धवेन राजते वसुधाधारिणि काऽपि राजते |

वनिता भवतापनाशिनी चरणप्रेष्यनिवेदिताशिनी ||२२. १०||

With such a husband lives a special woman on the silver mountain Kailasa,
who removes for sure the heat of mundane existence and who accepts with
affection the offerings made by the servant serving at her feet. May she be
victorious! ||22.10||

वनितापुरुषौ पुरातनौ विमले व्योमनि देवदम्पती |

भुवनत्रितयस्य तौ विभू रजताद्राविह सिद्धदम्पती ||२२. ११||

These two, man and woman of the Kailasa mount are the renowned ancient,
divine siddha couple, dwelling always in the spiritual space, chinmayakasa,
who are the true masters of the three worlds. ||22.11||

गजचर्मधरः कपालभृद् गृहनाथो गृहिणी तु कालिका |

रुधिराविलमुण्डमालिनी कथितौ तौ बत पण्डितैः शिवौ ||२२. १२||

Clad in elephant skin, he wears a skull; such is the lord of the house;
dark, she wears a garland of bloody sundered heads; such is the mistress
of the house. Still the wise men speak of them as auspicious. Wonder of
wonders! ||22.12||

Both are frightening in their form and yet they are hymned as
auspicious. Obviously, though inauspicious in appearance, they are ever
auspicious in their nature. (See.p.13. Adoration of the Divine Mother,
MP Pandit). ||22.12||

स किमिन्दुकलाशिरोमणिः किमुताश्लीलकपालभूषणः |

किमुमे भवती कपालिनी किमु विभ्राजितरत्नमालिनी ||२२. १३||

Is Shiva mooncrested? Or is he wearing a skull? Oh Uma, are you also wearing
skulls around your neck or beautified with a gemstudded necklace? ||22.13||

रमसेऽम्ब कपालमालिनी क्वचिदीशेन कपालमालिना |

अतुलप्रभनिष्कमालिना क्वचिदत्युत्तमरत्नमालिनी ||२२. १४||

Oh, Mother! You give perfect company to Lord Iswara! When he is wearing
skulls, you also wear skulls. When he is decked with beautiful goldenornaments
and appears pleasing, you enjoy his company by putting on gemstudded brilliant
jewels on your person. ||22.14||

युवयोर्मरुतस्तनूभुवो बलवन्तो भुवनप्रकम्पनाः |

शशिदीधितिहारि यद्यशो निगमे पावनमम्ब गीयते ||२२. १५||

Mother, your children are the maruts, strong, worldshaking whose
spotless glory exceeding the luster of the moon is hymned in the
Veda. (See.p.66. Adoration of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||22.15||

गुरुमुत्तममभ्रचारिणामसमब्रह्मनिधाननायकम् |

तव देवि शिवे तनूभुवां मरुतामन्यतमं प्रचक्षते ||२२. १६||

Goddess, spouse of Shiva! They speak of the teacher of the gods,
the sole presiding deity of the Veda as one of the maruts, thy
sons. (See.p.17. Adoration of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||22.16||

द्विरदं वदने महामदं सितदन्तच्छविधौतदिक्तटम् |

इतरत्र मुखान्नराकृतिं विदुरस्यैव विवर्तमद्भुतम् ||२२. १७||

Elephant faced, of profuse ichor, flooding the quarters with the white
radiances of his tusk, human in form otherwise than in face, this they know
to be a wonderful transformation of the very same Brahmanaspati. ||22.17||

Ganapati too is the son of the Divine Mother. Ganapati is the lord of
the hosts, the SeerPoet of seerpoets; his very mouth is the Pranava, the
creative Sound. He is none other than Brahmanaspati, the Master of the Word,
and leader of the soulforces. Only the form has changed. (See.p.18. Adoration
of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||22.17||

अखिलामरनिर्जयोन्नतः प्रथने तारकदानवो बली |

हृतवीर्यमदो बभूव यद्घनशक्त्यायुधतेजसाऽञ्जसा ||२२. १८||

By the prowess of whose solid Power Weapon the Titan Taraka, strong, high
of fame by conquest over all the Gods, was deprived of his insolence of velour
in a trice. (See.p.80. Adoration of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||22.18||

अमले हृदि निर्मलाशनाच्छिथिले ग्रन्थिचये नराय यः |

परिपक्वधिये प्रदर्शयेत् तमसः पारमपारवैभवः ||२२. १९||

He, with unlimited glory, and who shows beyond the shore of darkness
to him of ripened mind, and in whom the cluster of knots is loosened in
the heart pure by clean food. (See.p.81. Adoration of the Divine Mother,
MP Pandit). ||22.19||

द्रविडेषु शिशुत्वमेत्य यो गिरिशश्लोकविशेषगायिनीम् |

अमृतद्रवसारहारिणीं निगमाभां निबबन्ध संस्तुतिम् ||२२. २०||

He who as infant in the Dravida country composed the Vedalike,
nectarexcelling, eulogy of Shiva celebrating his wide fame. ||22.20||

The same Skanda was born in the Dravida country as Sambandhamurti
who at a very young age was inspired to compose the devaram in Tamil
in praise of the Glory of Shiva. This composition is called the Veda in
Tamil. (See.p.82. Adoration of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||22.20||

भुवि भट्टकुमारिलाख्यया भवमेत्याध्वररक्षणाय यः |

वरजैमिनिभाषिताशयं बहुलाभिः खलु युक्तिभिर्दधौ ||२२. २१||

Who took birth on earth, by name Bhatta Kumarila, promoted with several
arguments the import of the speech of worthy Jaimini for the guarding of
the sacrifice. ||22.21||

From Skanda it was that Bhatta Kumarila took birth and wrote the monumental
works, Tantravarika, slokavartika and Tuptika, supporting and fortifying the
Dharmamimamsa sastras of the great sage Jaimini, in order to safeguard the
institution of sacrifice in the Religion of the Vedas. (See.p.83. Adoration
of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||22.21||

अधुना विधुनोति यस्तमो विबुधप्रेक्षितमार्गरोधकम् |

रमणाख्यमहर्षिवेषभृत्श्रितशोणाचलचारुकन्दरः ||२२. २२||

Who today, under the guise of the maharshi by name Ramana resorting to
the charming cave of Arunachala, dispels the darkness that obstructs the
path seen of the wise. ||22.22||

Not merely in olden times, but even today God Skanda manifests on
earth. He it is who dwells in the cave of the Hill Arunachala, is known by
the appellation of Ramana and by his very presence and effulgence scatters the
Darkness of Ignorance which obstructs the Path of Light versioned by the Wise.
(See.p.84. Adoration of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||22.22||

स गुहोऽतिमहो महामहास्रिदशानां प्रथितश्चमूपतिः |

जगतामधिराज्ञि कोऽपि ते सुतरां प्रीतिपदं कुमारकः ||२२. २३||

Empress of the world! That Guha (deep hollow) of great exuberance, of vast
radiances, famed commander of the army of Gods, is some infant, great object of
thy love. (See.p.85. Adoration of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||22.23||

जयति त्रिपुरारिभामिनी गणपत्यादिमरुत्प्रसूरुमा |

तमसूत सुरारिधूतये त्रिदशानामपि या चमूपतिम् ||२२. २४||

Spouse of Tripurari reigns, the mother of Ganapati and maruts and others,
who also gave birth to that mighty commander of the army of gods, in order
to subdue the asuras, the enemy of gods. ||22.24||

स्वकुटुम्बकथाभिधायिनीर्गणनाथस्य वियोगिनीरिमाः |

अवधारयतु प्रसन्नया नगनाथप्रियनन्दिनी धिया ||२२. २५||५५०

May the beloved daughter of the Mountain be pleased to give a patient
hearing to these verses composed by Ganapati, set to viyogini meter, (because)
these verses portray the sacred stories connected with her family members! ||
22.25||

The twenty second section is a special one for more than one reason. In
this section the family members of the divine Mother and their divine powers
are vividly portrayed. Lord Iswara, Ganapati, Skanda, maruts, Brahmanaspati
are described with their Vedic and puranic significance. ||22.25||

Secondly, the different avataras, incarnations of Lord Skanda, the young
god, the most favorite son of the Divine Mother, are given, tracing the line
down to the present times. ||22.25||

Skanda | Sanatkumara | Jnanasambandha Murthy (Tamil Veda) |
Kumaraila Bhatta the author of Tantravartika | Sri Ramana The sage of
Arunachala.
