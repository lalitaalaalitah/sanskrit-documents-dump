SPONSORS' NOTE TO ENGLISH TRANSLATION</h3></b></center>
<UL><UL>
<P>
Umasahasram translation project was conceived in 2004 for personal studies
rather than any publication. However, there was no progress for quite some
time. As the events revolved, we had great fortune to meet Dr. Leela in
2010. She graciously agreed to accept the project. It is the divine will and
inspiration that we have become an instrument in sponsoring and funding the
project. In addition, we met major roadblocks during formatting the book in
presentable format. Hence, we had to learn and work in organizing the layout
to the best of our ability.
<P>
Resources outlined in reference section are utilized for comprehensive
articulation of Umasahasram interpretation.
<P>
Shri T.V. Kapali Shastri and M. P. Pandit's commentaries (Reference 1 and
2) were frequently referred and has been a backdrop for understanding the
purport of Umasahasram for deeper meaning of the slokas.
<P>
For several slokas in stabaka 20, we have adopted Shri Kapali Shastri's
metrical translation from collected works of Kapali Shastri vol. 3
(Reference  3)
<P>
We have diligently put forth best of our efforts in the translation by adding
a note for applicable references for completing the project.
<P>
We have consulted ``Collected works of Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni'' for
introduction to Ganapati Muni and Umasahasram (Reference  4). This project
would not be complete without proper introduction to Ganapati Muni and story
behind the composition of Umasahasram,
<P>
We have been aware that there are quite a few flaws in this electronic
version of Umasahasram translation. We humbly ask the readers to overlook
the flaws of this translation and rather cherish the deeper meaning, which
is inspired by Divine will thru the esteemed and scholarly translators.
<P>
