एकादशः स्तबकः  11th Stabaka

आर्यावृत्तम्  Arya meter

पादादिकेशान्तवर्णनम्  Description from feet to head

झषकेतुना प्रयुक्तः सम्मोहनचूर्णमुष्टिरीशाने |

दरहासो धरदुहितुः करोतु भुवनं वशेऽस्माकम् ||११. १||

A handful of mesmerizing (with love) particles of the gentle smile of
the daughter of the mountain that was targeted at Ishvara by Cupid god may
facilitate us to take control of the world. ||11.1||

A handful of particles of Devi's gentle smile that assisted Cupid god in
captivating Shiva is definitely capable of bringing the world occupied by
demons in our control. ||11.1||

The poet seems to be indicating his aspiration of the liberation of India
from British occupants. ||11.1||

उपजीवद्भिः कान्तेर्लेशांस्ते जगति सुन्दरैर्भावैः |

उपमितुमङ्गानि तव प्रायो लज्जेऽम्ब यतमानः ||११. २||

Oh, Mother! Perhaps I am ashamed at my futile effort to compare your limbs
with beautiful worldly ideas whose existence depend upon a tiny portion of
your luster. ||11.2||

All beautiful ideas in the world that are used for comparison depend upon
your luster; they do not have any luster of their own. But, comparison is
possible between two different things that have their own separate qualities
also. So, I am embarrassed of trying to compare your luster with incomparable
ideas. ||11.2||

अवतंसपल्लवतुलां बिभ्राणं श्रुतिनतभ्रुवः शिरसि |

चरणं व्रजामि शरणं वामं कामारिललनायाः ||११. ३||

The left foot of the consort of the enemy of cupid god is soft like new
leaves. I seek the shelter in that left foot, which is an adornment on the
head of the Veda. ||11.3||

Devi's left foot is praised in the scriptures. Devi is on the left side
of Hara (`all the Vedas are praising that word (foot). ||11.3||

शङ्करनयनोन्मादनमतिमधुरं भाति मतिमता वर्ण्ये |

जङ्घायुगं भवत्याः कुसुमपृषत्कस्य सर्वस्वम् ||११. ४||

Oh Devi! Praised by wise people, your shanks that enthrall the eyes of
Shankara are very beautiful. They shine as Cupid god's wealth. ||11.4||

एकैकलोकने द्वयमन्योन्यस्मरणहेतुतामेति |

देवि भवस्य तवोरुः शुण्डा च गजेन्द्रवदनस्य ||११. ५||

Oh Devi of Bhava! Your thigh and the trunk of elephant faced God remind
each other when they are beheld separately. ||11.5||

नाकोऽवलग्नमीश्वरि कटिरवनिर्भोगिनां जगन्नाभिः |

कुक्षौ न केवलं ते बहिरपि वपुषि त्रयो लोकाः ||११. ६||

Oh, consort of Shiva! All the three worlds dwell not only in your womb
but they are also seen outwardly in your limbs. Your waist is the sky,
loin is the earth, and navel is the nether world. ||11.6||

मन्ये महाकृपाणं तव वेणीमचलपुत्रि मदनस्य |

असिधेनुकां विशङ्के निशिततराग्रां तु रोमालिम् ||११. ७||

Oh Daughter of mountain! I consider your braid to be Cupid god's great
sword and I fancy your column of hair is his exceedingly sharp edged sword. ||
11.7||

द्विरदवदनेन पीतं षड्वदनेनाथ सकलभुवनेन |

अक्षय्यक्षीरामृतमम्बायाः कुचयुगं जयति ||११. ८||

May the breasts of the Mother, which has inexhaustible nectar  milk tasted
by Gajanana with two faces, Shanmukha with six faces, and the entire universe,
be victorious. ||11.8||

जगदम्ब लम्बमाना पार्श्वद्वितये तवागलाद्भाति |

सान्द्रग्रथितमनोज्ञप्रसूनमालेव भुजयुगली ||११. ९||

Oh Mother of the worlds! Your arms hanging down from your neck on both the
sides appear like two garlands thickly woven by beautiful flowers. ||11.9||

Garlands that are thickly woven suggest strong arms/shoulders. ||11.9||

जानन्ति शक्तिमसुराः सुषमां सख्यो वदान्यतामृषयः |

मृदुतां तवाम्ब पाणेर्वेद स देवः पुरां भेत्ता ||११. १०||

Oh, Mother! The demons know your strength and your friends know your
grace. The sages know your kind heart in granting favors and the Lord,
the destroyer of three cities knows the softness of your hand. ||11.10||

Your friends know your divine grace owing to their intimacy with you. ||
11.10||

कम्बुसदृगम्ब जगतां मणिवेषोडुस्रजाकृताकल्पः |

कण्ठोऽनघस्वरस्ते धूर्जटिदोर्नयनकर्णहितः ||११. ११||

Oh, Mother! Your neck that looks like a conch, decorated with garlands of
the stars in the guise of gems pleases the eyes of Shiva and his shoulders
while embracing (by its shape). Your unequivocal speech (clear voice)
pleases Hara's ears. ||11.11||

हरकान्ते वदनं ते दर्शं दर्शं वतंसशीतांशुः |

पूर्णोऽप्यवाप कृशतां प्रायेणासूयया शुष्कः ||११. १२||

Oh, Consort of Hara! The moon on Shiva's head that was (perhaps) full before
has perhaps diminished in size now. He has also become dry perhaps due to
jealousy, since he is watching your charming face constantly. ||11.12||

चन्द्रं रणाय सकला चपलाक्षीवदनजातिराह्वयताम् |

तं तु महसा मुखं ते महेशकान्ते जिगायैकम् ||११. १३||

Oh, consort of Mahesha! Let the entire women (deereyed) folk challenge the
moon for superiority but he is defeated by your face alone by its splendor. ||
11.13||

वदनकमलं तवेश्वरि कमलजयाद्दर्पितं सुधाभानुम् |

निर्जित्य कमलजातेरमलं महदाजहार यशः ||११. १४||

Oh Ishvari! The moon, that was proud due to his victory over the lotus,
is defeated by your lotuslike face, which has brought great fame to the
entire species of lotus. ||11.14||

लावण्यमरन्दाशा भ्रमद्भवालोकबम्भरं परितः |

मुग्धं मुखारविन्दं जयति नगाधीशनन्दिन्याः ||११. १५||

Victory to the pretty lotusface of the daughter of the mountain! Shiva's
glance (sight) is hovering around her lotusface like a bee with the desire
of its honey  grace (beauty). ||11.15||

शुद्धेन्दुसारनिर्मितमास्यार्धं ते भवानि भालमयम् |

सकलरमणीयसारैर्निर्मितमर्धान्तरं विधिना ||११. १६||

Oh Bhavani! The upper half of your face is made by the creator with the
essence of pure moon (nectar) and the other half by the essence of all
beautiful things. ||11.16||

The upper half of your face that is full of nectar is glowing. The other
half is made of the essence of solid beauty. Your face is the treasure house
of all life forces and means of all enjoyment. ||11.16||

वदनं तवाद्रिदुहितर्विजिताय नताय शीतकिरणाय |

द्वारपपदवीं प्रददा वयमिह दरहासनामधरः ||११. १७||

Oh, Daughter of the mountain, the moon, defeated by you, is bent (curved). So
he is given the position of the doorkeeper and is called `darahasa  reduced
laughter' on this earth. ||11.17||

ते ते वदन्तु सन्तो नयनं ताटङ्कमालयं मुकुटम् |

कवयो वयं वदामः सितमहसं देवि ते हासम् ||११. १८||

Oh Devi! May the pious people and the ancient poets compare the moon to
your eyes, earornament, crown, and abode! (But now) We, the poets consider
radiance of the moon as a manifestation of your delightful smile. ||11.18||

बिम्बाधरस्य शोभामम्बायाः को नु वर्णयितुमीष्टे |

अन्तरपि या प्रविश्य प्रमथपतेर्वितनुते रागम् ||११. १९||

Who can describe beauty of sensuous lips of the Mother that are like
bimba fruit? They can penetrate into the heart and induce love of the Lord
of pramathas (agitators). ||11.19||

The lip that is red like bimba fruit induces love/raga (colorful) in Shiva
(kaamaari) who is known to have great restraint. The term `raga' means both
love and color. ||11.19||

गणपतये स्तनघटयोः पदकमले सप्तलोकभक्तेभ्यः |

अधरपुटे त्रिपुरजिते दधासि पियूषमम्ब त्वम् ||११. २०||

Oh, Mother! You hold nectar in your pot like breasts for Ganapati; you
hold it in your feet to the devotees of seven worlds and in your lips for
Shiva the conqueror of three cities. ||11.20||

दृक्पीयूषतटिन्यां नासासेतौ विनिर्मिते विधिना |

भासां भवति शिवे ते मुखे विहारो निरातङ्कः ||११. २१||

Oh Shive! Nosebridge is made in between your eyes that are like the rivers
of nectar by the creator. But, the radiant light moves freely without any
impediment in your face. ||11.21||

कमलाविलासभवनं करुणाकेलीगृहं च कमनीये |

हरदयिते ते विनितहिते नयने ते जननि विजयेते ||११. २२||

Oh, Mother! Beloved of Hara! Victory to your beautiful eyes those are
precious to Hara, the abode of Lakshmi, playground of grace. They grant
favors to devotees who bend their heads. ||11.22||

सर्वाण्यप्यङ्गानि श्रीमन्ति तवेन्दुचूडकुलकान्ते |

कविनिवहविनुतिपात्रे श्रोत्रे देवि श्रियावेव ||११. २३||

Oh consort of Lord Induchuda (decked with moon over the head), all your
limbs are full of auspiciousness. Nevertheless, Devi, your ears that are
praised by poets, are indeed wealth (Shri) by themselves. ||11.23||

Divi's prosperous ears are described in earlier stabaka also. Similar thought
as `ears are the wealth' is seen in Chandogya, fifth prapathaka. All knowledge
that can to be acquired is in the form of sound and it comes through the
ears. ||11.23||

अपि कुटिलमलिनमुग्धस्तव केशः पुत्रि गोत्रसुत्राम्णः |

बिभ्रत्सुमानि कान्यपि हृदयं भुवनप्रभोर्हरति ||११. २४||

Oh, Daughter of the king of mountains! Your hair wins the heart of the
Lord of the worlds even though it is curly black soft and wearing some common
flowers. ||11.24||

Here, dirty (malina) means black.

चरणादिकुन्तलान्तप्रकृष्टसौन्दर्यगायिनीरेताः |

अङ्गीकरोतु शम्भोरम्भोजदृगात्मजस्यार्याः ||११. २५||२७५

May these prayers, with the description of the beautiful wife of Shambhu
from feet to hair in Arya meter that are dear to the son Ganapati, be
accepted. ||11.25||
