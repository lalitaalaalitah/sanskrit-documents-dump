अष्टमं शतकम्  Eight Shataka

एकोनत्रिंशः स्तबकः  29th Stabaka

नवविधभजनम्  Ninefold devotional sadhana

मदलेखावृत्तम्  Madaekha meter

आयुष्या भुवनानां चक्षुष्यास्त्रिपुरारेः |

कुर्वन्तु प्रमदं नः पार्वत्याः स्मितलेशाः ||२९. १||

In this chapter celebrated navavidha bhaktithe nine fold worship is
expounded.

May the gentle smile of Parvati, that which is the very essence of the
life of the universe, that which delights the eyes of Lord Shiva, give us
happiness. ||29.1||

नात्यर्घाणि निरर्थं नेतव्यानि दिनानि |

अम्बायाश्चरितानि श्रोतव्यान्यनघानि ||२९. २||

Waste not thy priceless days; listen to the holy deed of the Mother.

Time is fleeting. Half the life is spent in sleep, a quarter in growing
up. Very little is left for the quest of the Divine which is the purpose
of life given to man. He must make the utmost use of his days and cannot
afford to let any time pass in other activities. He should gather himself
in adoration of the Divine. ||29.2||

First step is to listen  sravanam.

उद्योगं कुरु जिह्वे संहर्तुं दुरितानि |

पूतान्यद्रिसुतायाः कीर्त्यन्तां चरितानि ||२९. ३||

Oh tongue! Exert yourself to erase the sins; laud the holy deeds of the
Daughter of the Mountain. ||29.3||

By constantly uttering words of her praise, celebrating her divine deeds,
vibrations of power and purity are released and they wipe out the grooves
of past sins, of movements made in ignorance. Speech gets purified.
Second step is chanting  kirthanam. ||29.3||

श्रीसक्तिर्विनिवार्या चिन्ता काऽपि न कार्या |

नित्यं चेतसि धार्या दीनानां गतिरार्या ||२९. ४||

Avoid attachment to wealth; do not worry; hold always in your mind the
Divine Mother, refuge of the utterly weak. ||29.4||

Attachment to material affluences keeps one immersed in worldly pursuits;
this bondage must be sundered. The mind must not be allowed to be distracted
or agitated; it must be kept carefree. Then is it possible to always remember
the Divine and keep the remembrances steady. Third step is remembrance
smaranam. ||29.4||

ज्ञातुं या गदितुं या श्रोतुं या श्वसितुं या |

द्रष्टुं याऽन्तरशक्तिस्तिष्ठात्र स्मृतिरेषा ||२९. ५||

The inner power that makes it possible to understand, to speak, to hear,
to breathe or to see, stay in that; that is remembrance. ||29.5||

There is a power of consciousness that enables the intelligence to
understand, the tongue to speak, the ears to hear, the lungs to inbreath
and outbreathe, the eyes to see. One must become aware of that and take
one's poise in it. This active awareness of the inner consciousness is
remembrance. ||29.5||

विभ्राजीनशताभं बिभ्राणं शिरसीन्दुम् |

स्मर्तव्यं जगदम्बारूपं वा धुतपापम् ||२९. ६||

Meditate upon the resplendent form of the Devi, with her crest moon as
bright as the hundred suns, which removes sins. ||29.6||

Dhyana meditation is offered as an alternative to smarana remembrance,
mentioned in the previous verse. ||29.6||

येषां स्यात्परितप्तं प्रायश्चित्तमघेन |

रुद्राणीपदसेवा प्रायश्चित्तममीषाम् ||२९. ७||

Of those whose mind is distressed due to sin, service of the feet of
Rudra's spouse becomes repentance. ||29.7||
The feet are the reservoir of the saving power and when they are cherished
and served, there is an instant transmission which purifies and transmutes
the adorer. If his mind is agitated and suffers due to any wrong action
committed, this service effects the deliverance.

To serve the feet of the Divine Mother is padasevanam. ||29.7||

तद्दीप्तं पदयुग्मं सेवे यत्र भवन्ति |

अङ्गुल्यो दश भानोर्भानूनां शतकानि ||२९. ८||

Hence I worship her radiant feet, whose ten toes are the tens and thousands
of rays of the sun. ||29.8||

नो चेत् कुप्यसि किञ्चिद् याचे वाचमतीते |

सेवां मातरुरीकुर्विष्टं मे कुरु मा वा ||२९. ९||

Oh, Mother! you are beyond the ken of speech. Yet I ask you for a small
favour. Pray do not be angry with me. Whether you fulfill my wishes or not,
kindly keep me at your service for ever. ||29.9||

शर्वाणीचरणार्चापीठं पीवरकाणाम् |

वध्यस्थानमिदं स्यादुग्राणां दुरितानाम् ||२९. १०||

The very pedestal used for the worship of the feet of the Shiva's spouse
becomes the axing stand for all the savage and aggressive sins. ||29.10||

When the Divine is worshipped with feeling and concentration, all is
charged with the vibrations of the Presence that manifests and accepts the
worship offered. Before this dynamic charge the karma of even the worst of
sins cannot stand. It is dissolved.
To worship the Divine Mother, archanam. ||29.10||

स्कन्दाम्बापदपीठस्पृष्टं चेद्बलमाप्तम् |

एकैकं सुममंहस्वेकैकं कुलिशं स्यात् ||२९. ११||

Each and every flower placed at the feet the mother of Skanda, is a
potential thunderbolt that destroys the most heinous sins. ||29.11||

अम्भोजोपममङ्घ्रिं शम्भोः पट्टमहिष्याः |

अंहस्संहतिमुग्रां संहर्तुं प्रणमामः ||२९. १२||

In the following seven verses salutations are offered.

In order that it destroys the most evil of the sins, we prostrate at the
lotus feet of the queen of shambhu. ||29.12||

ये कालीपदवेषं नालीकं प्रणमन्ति |

नैषां किञ्चिदशक्यं नालीकं मम वाक्यम् ||२९. १३||

Those who sincerely salute the feet of Kalidevi, are sure to succeed in
every venture, this is my promise. ||29.13||

वासस्तेऽत्र समाप्तः पङ्केतो व्रज दूरम् |

कालीं शङ्करनारीं कालेऽस्मिन् प्रणमामः ||२९. १४||

We are saluting Kali, the consort of Shiva. Therefore sin, you may go
away. Your stay here has ended. ||29.14||

Kali destroys all sins.

आशा रे तदवस्था भूभागनटतस्ते |

कामानां क्व नु पारः कामारेर्नम नारीम् ||२९. १५||

Oh Friend! Where is the end for the series of desires you possess? You
aimlessly roam all over. Take my advice. Bow down to the consort of Shiva,
the foe of kama. (to get freed from desires and to attain peace). ||29.15||

धन्यास्ते तुहिनाद्रेः कन्यां ये प्रणमन्ति |

अन्यानुन्नतशीर्षान् मन्ये वन्यलुलायान् ||२९. १६||

Blessed are those who bow down to Devi Parvati. All others hold their
heads high in vain like buffaloes roaming in the wild. ||29.16||

पादाम्भोजमुमायाः प्राज्ञास्संप्रणमन्तः |

गृह्णन्ति श्रियमस्मिन् राजन्तीं निजशक्त्या ||२९. १७||

Bowing to the lotus feet of Uma, the wise draw the prosperity glowing in
the Lotus by their inherent power. ||29.17||

When the enlightened bow down in conscious submission to the lotus like
feet of Uma the Divine Mother, there is an effortless drawing of the forces
of prosperity and wealth from the feet. The interchange is spontaneous and
automatic. To bow to the Divine Mother is vandanam. ||29.17||

मन्दाराद्रिसुताङ्घ्री दातारौ सदृशौ स्तः |

उत्कण्ठैः फलमाद्यादन्यस्मान्नतकण्ठैः ||२९. १८||

Both the wish yielding tree mandara and the feet of Devi are the same in
fulfilling wishes of the good. Only difference is that, one has to look up
in case of the tree, while in case of Devi, one has to look down. (To serve
the feet). ||29.18||

कालस्यापि विजेतुः शर्वाण्याश्चरणस्य |

एषोऽहं कविलोकक्ष्मापालोऽस्मि भुजिष्यः ||२९. १९||

Servitor of the feet of Mother Sharvani which are victorious even over
death, I am the monarch of the world of poets! ||29.19||

The feet of the Divine Mother have the upper hand even over the allpowerful
death. The poet says that by virtue of his service to these feet, he has become
preeminent among all poets. Such is the efficacy of the Divine's service.
To do service to the Divine is dasyam. ||29.19||

रक्ते दर्शय रागः रुद्राणीपदपद्मे |

चेतः पुष्यति शोभां सारस्सारवतोऽग्रे ||२९. २०||

Oh Mind! Show reddening love for the red lotus feet of Rudra's
spouse. Strength glows in the presence of the strong. ||29.19||

The mind must turn readily and naturally as to a comrade, to the lotus
feet of the Divine Mother. In so doing the mind shares and glows in the ruddy
splendor of the beloved feet. Friendship grows between those who have things
in common. The feet have the ruddy splendor and the mind the red flush of
love. To have friendship with the Divine is sakhyam. ||29.19||

संशोध्यागमजालं सारांशं प्रवदामः |

स्कन्दाम्बापदभक्तिर्भुक्त्यै चाथ विमुक्त्यै ||२९. २१||

This, we say, is the essence from the plumbing of all agamas; devotion to
the feet of the Mother of Skanda results in both enjoyment and release. ||
29.21||

Vedas, Tantras, and the various philosophies may each speak of different
truths. But the truth common to all is the efficacy of complete surrender,
to the divine which is the crown of devotion. Such a surrender does not
merely effect a release from the rounds of birth and death; it also ensures
full enjoyment here and beyond. Unreserved selfgiving wins both liberation
and fulfilment. Selfsurrender to Divine is atmanivedanam. ||29.21||

वात्सल्यं गतिहीनेष्वायुष्यं सुकृतस्य |

भूयोभिः सह सख्यं श्रीहेतुष्विह मुख्यम् ||२९. २२||

Being kind to the destitute enhances one's merit. Making friends with a
variety of people increases one's status by adding to his wealth and fame. ||
29.22||

श्लाघ्यं पुष्यति कामं प्रेमा स्वप्रमदायाम् |

शर्वाणीपदभक्तिर्नित्याय प्रमदाय ||२९. २३||

No doubt that loving one's own wife increases one's happiness. But devotion
to Sharvani, makes the person happy for ever. ||29.22||

एकैवं बहुभेदा भिन्नत्वाद्विषयाणाम् |

रत्याख्या द्रुतिरन्तः सा सूते फलभेदान् ||२९. २४||

Though one in essence, affection shown to different objects yields different
fruits. ||29.24||

हर्षं कञ्चन मातुर्मत्तो भक्तिभरेण |

तन्वन्नेष विधत्तां हेरम्बो मदलेखाः ||२९. २५||७२५

May these verses set to the meter madalekha composed by Ganapati, who is
intoxicated with his devotion to the Mother, please her. ||29.25||

Translation of ten verses of this stabaka are taken from the book, Adoration
of the Divine Mother, by MP Pandit.
