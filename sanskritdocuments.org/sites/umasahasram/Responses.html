We congratulate you all sincerely on the publication of Uma Sahasram, the great outflowing of praise to Mother by Sri Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni.
It is surely only by her grace that you are presenting and sharing this work with us all; for that we are extremely thankful. 
That we are receiving it also on the Mahasamadhi day of Sri Kavayakanta's Guru, Sri Ramana Maharshi, in whose sublime presence Uma Sahasram was composed 
in the Mango Tree cave at Arunachala, is indeed also fitting.
Our pranams to all.<BR>
In Sri Bhagavan,<BR>

Thanks.  Divinely beautiful!
<HR>
Congrats to one and all in your team for completing this mega exercise.  I am copying to some of my friends here who would be more than happy to not only recite it but also understand the intellectual work through the translation.
<P>
The way the site has been arranged is remarkable.  Please accept our heartfelt gratitude for all such efforts towards preserving our literature.  <BR>
