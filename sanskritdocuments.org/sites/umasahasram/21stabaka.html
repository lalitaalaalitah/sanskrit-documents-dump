षष्ठं शतकम्  Sixth Shataka

एकविंशः स्तबकः  21st Stabaka

अर्धनारीश्वरः  Divine form with both male and female aspects

अनुष्टुब्वृत्तम्  Anustubha meter

In the 21st stabaka, Devi, who shares half of the Lord Iswara's body,
is eulogized. This is celebrated as the Ardhanarishwara form of the divine,
a form consisting of both male and female portions.

इतः पीत्वा कुचं स्कन्दे प्रसारितकरे ततः |

जयति स्मितमुद्भूतं शिवयोरेकदेहयोः ||२१. १||

The smile that lights up the face of Lord Shiva and Devi Shivani, his
consort, who are lodged in the same body reigns supreme; the smile emanating
out of the childish prank of Skanda, their child, who having suckled at one
breast, extends his little hand to reach to the other (which is absent). ||
21.1||

एकतो मणिमञ्जीरक्वाणाहूतसितच्छदम् |

अन्यतो नूपुराहीन्द्रफूत्कारकृततद्भयम् ||२१. २||

The swans, which are happy attracted by the jingling sound of the anklets
(of Devi) on the one side, are terrified by the hissing noise of the serpents,
(coiling round the foot of Lord Shiva as his ornament). ||21.2||

From this verse up to the sixteenth verse the portrayal continues in the
same vein. This is known as paryayokta figure of speech. ||21.2||

गीर्वाणपृतनापालं बालं लालयदेकतः |

उत्सङ्गे गणसम्राजमर्भकं बिभ्रदन्यतः ||२१. ३||

Skanda, the Devasenapati, as a child is fondled on the left; Ganesha,
the elder is fondled on the right portion. ||21.3||

Kumara or Skanda is also known as Shaktidhara. He is taken care of more by
Devi, the Shakti; Ganesha of omkara countenance is more of Shivamsa and is
taken care of by Shiva. Shakti and Shiva, and their chief amshas or essences
are mentioned here. ||21.3||

विडम्बितब्रह्मचारिकोकैकस्तनमेकतः |

कवाटार्धनिभं बिभ्रद्वक्षः केवलमन्यतः ||२१. ४||

The left portion has a breast resembling a chakravaka bird (rounded);
the right chest resembles a strong panel of a door (plain). ||21.4||

सेनान्याऽऽस्वादितस्तन्यमनुफूत्कुर्वतैकतः |

फूत्कारमुखरं नागमुग्रं जाग्रतमन्यतः ||२१. ५||

On one portion is a breast suckled by Skanda, on the other is a hissing
serpent, ever active. ||21.5||

एकतो दोर्लतां बिभ्रन् मृणालश्रीविडम्बिनीम् |

शुक्रशुण्डालशुण्डाभं चण्डं दोर्दण्डमन्यतः ||२१. ६||

On one side is a slender creeperlike hand that puts even a lotus stalk
to shame by its grace, on the other side is found a plump strong hand that
resembles the trunk of an elephant. ||21.6||

कुत्राप्यविद्यमानेऽपि वन्दनीये तदा तदा |

परस्परकरस्पर्शलोभतो विहिताञ्जलि ||२१. ७||

Though there is no one worthy of salutation by folded hands by these two
in the singlebody, their two hands clasp very often with the intention of
mutual feel to touch each other. ||21.7||

शक्रनीलसवर्णत्वाद् भागयोरुभयोरपि |

ऊर्ध्वाधराङ्गसापेक्षसन्धिज्ञानगलस्थलम् ||२१. ८||

Joining of the two parts viz., left and right of the woman and man, in the
neckregion is faintly seen due to the similarites of color of the two viz.,
the hue of the blue saffire. In the right portion above the neck Lord Iswara's
fair complexion ends where us below the neck the blue hue comes to an end
(and fair complexion starts). ||21.8||

It is to be noted that though Parvati is Gauri i.e., fair in complexion,
in her Kali form she is dark. Hence the similarity of color in the neck
region. ||21.8||

एकतः कैरवश्रेणीनिद्रामोचनलोचनम् |

अन्यतः कमलावासक्षणाधायकवीक्षणम् ||२१. ९||

On the left side is the mooneye that takes away the sleep of the blue
lilies (opens the petals); on the right is the suneye that delights the
lotus flowers. ||21.9||

That moon and sun are the eyes of the supreme divinity is a wellknown
fact. ||21.9||

एकतश्चक्षुषा चारुतारेणाधीतविभ्रमम् |

अन्यतः पाणिपाथोजे खेलतो मृगबालतः ||२१. १०||

On the left side is a beautiful eye with an attractive eyeball that is
receiving instructions with regard to attractive looks from the young deer
which is playing at the hands of Lord Shiva, on the right side. ||21.10||

एकतो भालफलके काश्मीरेण विशेषितम् |

अन्यतोऽर्धेक्षणेनैव रतिभ्रूविभ्रमद्रुहाः ||२१. ११||

On the one side the broad forehead is beautified by the Kashmiri kesara
(saffron), on the other side it is decorated with half the eye that burnt
down the cupid in great rage. ||21.11||

एकतः शीतलालोकं साधुलोकशिवङ्करम् |

अन्यतः प्रज्वलत्प्रेक्षं दुष्टगोष्ठीभयङ्करम् ||२१. १२||

On the left side, is the compassionate coollook that can provide security
to the entire community of the good and noble; on the other side is found
the fierce sight that causes terror in the minds of the evilfolk. ||21.12||

एकतो मणिताटङ्कप्रभाधौतकपोलकम् |

अन्यतः कुण्डलीभूतकुण्डलीभूतकुण्डलि ||२१. १३||

Left side of the face, i.e., cheek is glowing by the brilliant rays
emanating from the gems studded in the earrings; on the right side is the
curled serpent that forms the earring. ||21.13||

एकतः कुन्तलान् बिभ्रदिन्द्रनीलोपमद्युतीन् |

अन्यतः पावकज्वालापाटलांशुच्छटा जटाः ||२१. १४||

On the left side are found long dark hairs glistening like bluegems; on the
other side are seen locks of hair bright like the flames of fire. ||21.14||

एकतः केशपाशेन कीर्णेनोरसि भासुरम् |

अन्यतो लम्बमानस्य भोगिनो हरता श्रियम् ||२१. १५||

On the left side is found the shining dark hair on the chest that challenges
the attraction of the serpents spread on the right side of the chest. ||
21.15||

अवतंसितमम्लानपारिजातस्रजैकतः |

विमलोल्लोलमालिन्या विभुधापगयाऽन्यतः ||२१. १६||

On the left side is found the fresh wreath of parijata flowers; on the other
i.e., the masculine portion, is found the stream of Ganga with a series of
calm waves. ||21.16||

रौप्याचलकृतावासं प्राप्यं युक्तेन चेतसा |

वस्तु रामापुमाकारं हृदि सन्निदधातु मे ||२१. १७||

Mount Kailasa is the natural abode of the wonderful form Ardhanariswara,
of the supreme divinity; yet I beseech that it dwells in my heart. ||21.17||

कान्तार्धविग्रहे मातर्जटार्धाश्चिकुरास्तव |

दधत्यदभ्रसन्ध्याभ्रयुक्तकालाभ्रविभ्रमम् ||२१. १८||

Oh, Mother! Your black beautiful hair in company with the brown locks of
Lord Shiva, creates an attractive sight of the evening sky laden with dark
blue clouds. ||21.18||

दम्पत्योर्युवयोरेष लोपो यन्नास्ति शैलजे |

वामं पार्श्वं विभोः शेतुं दातुं ते दक्षिणः करः ||२१. १९||

Oh Shailaja! Daughter of the mountain, with respect to you two, the couple
in a single body, there is no lacuna, though you don't have the right hand
and the Lord has no left, because, your left hand is enough to fulfill the
wishes of the people; Lord's right hand is selfsupporting, supports Shakti,
the origin of the world. ||21.19||

लोके स्त्री स्तनयुग्मेन पुष्णात्येकं सुतं न वा |

स्तनेनैकेन शर्वाणि पुष्णासि त्वं जगत्त्रयम् ||२१. २०||

In the normal course, it is doubtful if a woman with two breasts is able
to feed one child. However you, for sure, with a single breast, are capable
of feeding the three worlds. ||21.20||

खिद्यन्ति योषितः कुक्षौ वहन्त्योऽर्भकमेककम् |

अर्धकुक्षौ दधासि त्वं त्रिलोकीमम्ब लीलया ||२१. २१||

Normally women find it difficult to bear one child in their womb. They
suffer a lot. However you are able to hold the three words in half the
stomach. ||21.21||

अनुरूपा शिवस्य त्वमनुरूपः शिवस्तव |

अलङ्कारोऽनुरूपो वामकलङ्कोऽर्भकः शशी ||२१. २२||

You are worthy of the Lord, and the Lord Shiva is the right match for
you. Even your ornament, the young moon, free from the faults of the regular
moon, is worthy of you two! ||21.22||

तवैव तव देहांशो हरस्यैव हरस्य यः |

प्राणास्तु जगतां धात्रि हरस्य त्वं हरस्तव ||२१. २३||

Oh Mother of the universe! Though locked up in a single body, with
the Lord, you have complete control over your portion and Hara on his
portion. (Despite this division), you are the lifebreath of the Lord and he
is your lifebreath! ||21.23||

You two are bodily divided, but vitally connected. ||21.23||

अविभक्तं भवानि स्वं भवस्य तव चोभयोः |

सकृत्सकरुणं चेतः सङ्कल्पयतु नश्शिवम् ||२१. २४||

Oh Bhavani! May the undivided compassionate mind of you two think of the
highest good for the devotees. ||21.24||

भवस्य भागमुत्सृज्य भवानी भागमात्मनः |

भजत्वनुष्टुभामासां सृष्टानां नारसिंहिना ||२१. २५||५२५

May Devi be pleased to receive the portion specified in these verses set
to anushtubh meter, composed by the son of Narasimha, setting aside the
portion meant for the lord. ||21.25||
