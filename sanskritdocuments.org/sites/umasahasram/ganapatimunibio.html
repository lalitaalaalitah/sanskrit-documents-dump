Articulated by Shri K. Natesan in collected works of Vasishtha Kavyakantha
Ganapati Muni. (Ref  5)
<P>
Vasishtha Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni (1878 1936) belongs to the rare race of
intellectual and spiritual giants who crowded into the narrow corridors of the
last quarter of 19th and first four decades of the 20th century to endow life,
letters and all endeavors with meaning, purpose and altitude. He was a valiant
soldier in the cause of Truth and Divinity. For communing with the Divine,
certainly he was wellendowed, gifted as he was with marvelous powers of mind,
intellect and soul. Even highly learned people of our time wonder at his
indubitable versatile genius, keenness of perception and understanding of our
modern problems, though he had never been to school all his life. His powers
of intellect and intuition had solved and untied many mystic knots. His wide
scholarship and studies in religious lore harmonized in him all religions and
schools of philosophy. He was a master of metaphysics and his gift transported
him into regions whence he could see the entire manifestation. In fact,
he belonged to the order of the Rig Vedic seers who were gods among men.
<P>
The Muni's life story is sweet and allabsorbing and has been beautifully
rendered in the famous biography Vashistha Vaibhavam by his foremost disciple,
Sri Kapali Shastriar. Ganapati Muni was born in Kalavarayi near Bobbili in
Andhra Pradesh on 17th November1878. He belonged to a family of Sri Vidya
initiates (in vashishtha gotram), which had actually migrated from a village
near Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu in the late 16th or early 17th century (later
the family was wellknown as the ``Ayyalasomayajulu'' family). His parents,
Narasimha Sastry and Narasamamba, had three sons, Ganapati being the middle
one. Nearly a year before his birth, on the holy day of rathasaptami,
his mother had been to the famous Surya (Sun) temple at Arasavalli (near
Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh) to offer her prayers and worship. She stayed
overnight in the temple after the traditional worship to the Lord. In the
next early morning she had a dream in which a beautiful woman with golden
divine radiance emerged from the corridors of the temple, approached her
with a shining pot of fire and giving it in her hands vanished. To her
utter astonishment, the moment the fire pitcher came into contact with her,
it entered her womb and assumed the form of a child. Soon after her return
to home from Arasavalli, she showed signs of pregnancy. She believed that
her child was a divine gift of God Agni (fire). While she was waiting to
deliver the child, her husband, Narasimha Sastry, had gone to the holy city
of Kashi (Benares in Uttar Pradesh) in November 1878, where he also had a
unique experience. When he was performing tapas in the Dhundiganapati temple
(near Visweswara Ghat) he had the vision of a little child emanating from the
Deity and coming near him. After these wonderful experiences by both parents,
Ganapati was born in the parental home of his mother on 17th November 1878. The
father appropriately named his second son Ganapati, rooted in his conviction
that the child was an emanation of God Ganapati himself. It may be noted
that the Vedic deity Agni (Fire) is none other than Ganapati described in
the puranas and worshipped in the tantras. Ganapati himself was conscious of
his divinity. He has expressed this in his most famous poem Umasahasram and
has said that he was born as an amsa (portion) of God Ganapati. He has also
expressed his conviction about the identity between him and God Ganapati,
the guiding spirit of his corporeal existence, in his work Herambopasthanam
(Glory of Ganapati).
<P>
Ganapati was educated entirely at home. His father, Narasimha Sastry, like
his ancestors, was an expert and well versed in mantra shastra, astrology
and ayurveda. With this traditional family background, proficiency in
these subjects came naturally to Ganapati. When he was only 10 years old,
he was able to prepare the pañchamgam (almanac). He finished studying the
classical Sanskrit poems and then devoted himself to the study of grammar
and poetics. At the same time he delved deep into the writings of Vyasa and
Valmiki. Again and again he read the Mahabharata. His horizon widened and his
intellect mellowed with an everdeepening perception. Like the ancient Rishis,
Ganapati wanted to experience immense strength and power by the practice of
tapasya through mantra japa and meditation. Although married at an early age
to Srimati Vishalakshi, he started visiting one sacred place after another
for his tapas when he was 18 years old. He used to stay in one place for a
few days or even months. In one such visit to Bhubaneswar (in Orissa, where
the famous ``Lingaraj'' temple of Lord Siva is located), during his tapas,
Ganapati had a vision, in which Goddess Lalitambika (bhuvaneshwari) appeared
before him, offering divine nectar. As Ganapati tasted this heavenly nectar,
the Goddess watched him with a sweet smile, full of grace. From then onwards,
the sweetness of the nectar became an integral part of him. After this
incident, Ganapati's intellect developed a rare sharpness and he attained
complete mastery over poetry. Indeed, the literary work composed after this
incident is endowed with a distinct sweetness and grace.
<P>
When Ganapati was staying in Kashi, he came to know that an assembly
of scholars (harisabha) would be held in the famous city of Navadwipa in
Bengal. On the advice of his friends he got a letter of introduction and went
to Navadwipa. There he excelled in all the difficult tests that he was put to
with an effortless ease that stunned his examiners, who unanimously conferred
the title kavyakantha (one who has poetry in his throat  voice of poetry)
on him forthwith. He was only 22 years old then (details are in Volume 11).
<P>
Ganapati repaired to the south of the country in his 25th year. From
Kanchipuram he came toArunachala (Thiruvannamalai) in 1903 to perform
tapas. He visited twice Sri Brahmana Swamy (who was later named as Bhagavan
Sri Ramana Maharshi by Kavyakantha himself) before he accepted a teacher's job
at Vellore in 1904. Later in 1907, he resigned his job at Vellore and returned
to Arunachala. It was at this stage that he sought and gained the grace of Sri
Brahmana Swamy (Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi). An intellectual and spiritual
giant who had high achievements to his credit and a host of followers as
well, Kavyakantha still felt that his life's purpose was not fulfilled. He
remembered Brahmana Swamy whom he had met earlier and approached him for his
grace and gain inner realization, peace and true import of tapas that he still
lacked. On 18.11.1907 Kavyakantha approached Brahmana Swamy, who was staying
in the Virupaksha cave, and prostrating himself at his feet said in a trembling
voice: ``All that has to be read I have read, even Vedanta Sastra I have fully
understood. I have performed japa and puja to my heart's content. Yet I have
not up to this time understood what tapas is. Hence have I sought refuge at
thy feet, pray enlighten me about the nature of tapas.'' For quite some time
Brahmana Swamy gazed silently at Kavyakantha. He broke his 11 years of long
silence and spoke gently, ``If one watches where his notion of ``I'' springs,
the mind will be absorbed into that. That is tapas. If a mantra is repeated
and attention is directed to the source where the mantra sound is produced,
the mind will be absorbed in that. That is tapas.'' The scholar poet was filled
with joy to have found his guru, and announced that the upadesha (teaching)
was original, and that Brahmana Swamy was indeed a maharshi and should be
called so thereafter. He gave the full name Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi to
Brahmana Swamy, whose original name was Venkataraman. Thus, the meeting was
of profound significance not only for Kavyakantha but also for the world at
large, which could learn from such a high authority about the real stature of
Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, the Silent Sage of Arunachala. Following this
momentous meeting, Ganapati composed his great devotional poem, Umasahasram,
a thousand verses in praise of Uma, the Divine Mother, as a part of his tapas
in gratitude to the great Goddess for having given him the Maharshi as his
Guru (Master). This work is the magnum opus of Sri Vasishta Ganapati Muni.
<P>
The Muni had the unique experience of kapalabheda. In the summer of 1922 at
the Mango cave of the Arunachala hills, the Muni had several yogic experiences,
arising from deeper parts of his being and invading his physical consciousness
(resulting in great physical pain). During this, he visited his Master and
told him of his inner and physical experience. His most compassionate Master,
Sri Maharshi, comforted him by placing his lotus hands on his head. On the
very night, he had the experience of the culmination of kundalini  sadhana,
resulting in the most unique experience of kapalabheda. His cranium was
broken into two parts; a distinct sound caused by the breaking arose from the
passage, which joins the two holes of the ears. A line of smoke going out of
the head was perceived there. The Muni later spoke to his disciples about this
yogic experience and that this has been mentioned in the sixth chapter of the
Taittrriyopanishad, quoting vyapohya shirshakapale bhurityagnau prati tishati
(``having separated the two parts of the cranium, he stands established in
Fire as Bhuh, the earth element'') and mentioned several great effects of
the power of yoga experienced at this time with their secrets. It is usually
believed that the physical effects of this great experience are such that
the body cannot sustain long following this event. However, in his case,
with the strength of his own tapasya and the Grace of his most compassionate
Master, he lived for fourteen long years (although he had to observe certain
physical restrictions, such as that he could not shave his head nor could put
his bare feet on the ground) after this experience. This event speaks volumes
on the extraordinary nature of his tapasya and the fact that he was perhaps
the greatest Master of tantra born on this earth. In fact, the final revision
of his magnum opus Umasahasram after this experience, remains, testimony not
only to his supreme mastery over the tantras but also his ability to find
the reconciliation and concordance between the Vedic, Upanishadic and the
Tantric schools of thoughts. The kapalabheda experience also reconfirms the
conviction that he was the direct aWsha (portion) of the Vedic deity agni
(who resides as the power of kuKoalinn in the muladhara of hUman beings).
<P>
The poet seer Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni met Sri Aurobindo on 15th August
1928. He stayed at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram for about a fortnight. During this
stay at the Ashram, the Muni meditated with The Mother a few times. After one
such meditation, The Mother expressed that the Muni was a real yogi who could
plunge into great depths the moment he started meditation and that she had not
so far found any person abiding in Her spiritual consciousness as Ganapati
Muni did. Further, at the instance of Sri Kapali and Sri S. Doriswamy
Iyer, the Muni translated some portions of Sri Aurobindo's The Mother
(matrtattvaprakashika) in chaste Sanskrit verses with some notes. On reading
the Muni's translation, Sri Aurobindo seems to have very generously observed,
``It far excels the original.'' It is also worth mentioning that the Muni
presented to Sri Aurobindo the last and final version of his Umasaharam
(written in his own hand writing after his experience of kapalabeheda)
with specific notes on each chapter before his meeting in 1928.
<P>
It is more than six decades since the great Kavyakantha Ganapati Muni
passed away in 1936. He was a great tapasvi, whose one aim in life was the
restoration of Bharata Mata (Mother India) to her ancient greatness. Unlike
others who aim at liberation for themselves, this great soul believed that he
must obtain the grace of God not for himself but for the nation and through
it for the betterment of the world. Towards that consummation he had done
penance since his early years and this, too, very rigorously during the last
years of his life.
<P>
The Vedic seers were by no means recluses from the affairs of the world. In
fact, these Vedic seers made themselves the superior vehicle through which the
divine forces of heaven played for the welfare of humanity. To become one such
perfect instrument in the hands of the Maha Shakti was the goal towards which
Ganapati worked and dedicated his entire life. Although the Muni was a giant
personality, he was very humble in his daytoday life. This can be proved by
two incidents in his divine life. The Muni and his beloved disciple, Daivarata,
did tapas in Padaivedu near Vellore in the year 1917. As a result of the tapas,
certain Mantras were revealed to his disciple Daivarata. Ganapati Muni, the
guru, noted down the Mantras as they came down from the lips of Daivarata,
his disciple. He even wrote a commentary on the Mantras, as Sankara did for
his disciple, Hastamalaka. There is yet another incident to which I would
like to draw the attention of the readers. The Muni was verily a fountain of
love and affection for his pupils and followers far and near. This did not
deter the guru and shishya from having a difference of opinion at times. The
Muni blessed Sri Kapali Shastriar and permitted him to follow Sri Aurobindo.
<P>
A scholar poet, Sri Vasishta Ganapati Muni has many spiritual and other
writings in Sanskrit to his credit. Umasahasram, gitamala, ramanagita,
ramanacatvarimshat and saddarshanam are a few titles wellknown among his
disciples and others. But very little is known about his other numerous
Sanskrit writings, covering a wide variety of topics: praises and prayers to
various deities (stotras), poetic compositions (kavyas), philosophy (darshana),
logic (nyayashastra), medical science (ayurveda), astrology and astronomy
(jyotishashastra), commentaries (bhashya), novel (akhyayika), letters (patrani)
and other research works. His versatility can also be judged from his writings
samrajyanibandhanam (a proposed constitution for India) and lalibhashopadesha
(a new language for the Indian people). He was spontaneous in composing all
these either in verse form (shlokas) or in the form of aphorisms (sutras)
or prose form (gadya). Nevertheless, all these were the result of his tapas,
an outpouring of his soul in seeking or gratitude to the Divine.
<P>
Of his stotrakavyas, Umasahasram, indranisaptashati, Prachandachanditrishati
and gitamala are meant for those longing for a great spiritual realisation. The
indrasahashranama is a composition of thousand names of indra culled from the
Rigveda, which are strung into a garland of one hundred and eight verses. The
ramanacatvarimshat  (40 verses in praise of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi)
is chanted daily both at the Sri Ramana Ashramam and in innumerable homes
of the devotees of Sri Ramana Maharshi. The Muni had a unique ability of
rendering philosophical thoughts in the form of poetry (shlokas), and his
writings vishvamnmamsa, ramanagita, saddarshanam and tattvaghantahatakam
remain in testimony to this. Ramanagita is in the form of recordings of
questions put forth by disciples and the answers given by the Maharshi
and is one of the most cherished writings of the Muni. His saddarshanam
is the Sanskrit rendering of Sri Maharshi's Tamil writing, ulladu narpadu
(Forty Verses on Reality) on which his beloved and learned disciple, Sri
T.V. Kapali Shastriar, has written a faithful commentary in Sanskrit. This
reflects the spirit of Sri Maharshi's original teachings.
<P>
Of his vast and variety of sutra writings, it would be difficult to single
out any one as more meritorious than the others. Dashamahavidyasutram
(the ten cosmic powers of the Divine Mother as described in the tantras) is
an outstanding composition, in which the Muni has described the ten cosmic
aspects of the Divine Mother and their significance. Here he has also brought
out the association of these ten cosmic aspects of the Mother described in
the Tantra with the corresponding Vedic deities. Thereby, not only he has
been able to bring forth a link between the Vedas, Upanishads and Tantras,
but also has been successful in dispelling several wrong conceptions on
the significance of these deities. These compositions reflect Muni's great
powers of Yogic perception. The way in which he has expounded the different
deities such as kali, tara, sundari, bhuvaneshvari, prachandachandi, etc.,
and correlates them to the Vedantic concepts has once for all removed all
antagonisms and has bridged the socalled gulf between the Vedantic and
Tantric schools of philosophy. Rajayogasarasutra is a short and concise
exposition of the Upanishadic methods of the inner quest. Caturvyuhasutra
is a revelation of the cosmic divinities wherein he has expounded the four
important emanations of the Vedic deity Indra (akasha, kala, vidyut and
surya). Jaiminnyatarkavartikam is his own interpretation of the sutras of
Jaimini, where he has advocated that the Vedas are indeed pauruseyam (of huma
origin). Further, in this he has given his own interpretation of the mimamsa
philosophy, placing it on a higher pedestal in relation to Vedanta. His
shabdapramanacarca also discusses the origin of Vedas. Pañcajanacarca
and vivahadharmasutram are related to social aspects. In the former one the
practice of ``untouchability'' is condemned with the authority of shastras. In
the latter he deals with marriage as a sacrament. His other sutra writings
also include cikitsanushasanam (ayurveda) and ganakanthabharanam (astronomy)
as well as samrajyanibhandhanam (a proposed constitution for India).
<P>
The prose writings of Vasistha Ganapati Muni too are extensive and these
include: commentaries on several texts including Vedas and Upanishads; study
on the different characters of the great epic poem Mahabharata; letters to
Sri Ramana Maharshi, The Mother of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, and others.
<P>
His commentaries on Rigvedic mantras and the Ishopanishad, though
brief, are revealing and illumining. The Muni has given his own original
spiritual interpretation of the mantras, and he was highly critical of the
ritualistic interpretation of Rigvedic mantras by Sayana. His commentary on
the Ishopanishad is original and is in the light of the teachings of Sri
Ramana Maharshi. His bharatacaritramimamsa is unique as it establishes a
link between some of the important characters of the mahabharata and those
mentioned in the Vedic texts. ramanagita, saddarshana and the commentary on
the upadeshasaram (thirty verses written by Sri Ramana Maharshi in Sanskrit),
are most popular writings of the Muni which reveal the greatness of the
teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi.
<P>
His novel, purna, in Sanskrit, though unfinished, is unique in many ways. The
style and diction that the Muni used here make it an unparalleled novel of
his time. It not only depicts the ability of the Muni to write beautifully and
spontaneously in Sanskrit prose, but it also records his power of expressing
the feelings of the heart and not just the logic of the mind.
<P>
In the letters of the Muni to Sri Maharshi and The Mother of the Sri Aurobindo
Ashram, one can find the art of letterwriting in Sanskrit. Through these
letters he was able to express lucidly his deepest aspirations, concepts
and thoughts.
<P>
However, it is difficult to summarize the thoughts, perceptions and literary
ability of the Muni. The Muni, indeed, was a versatile genius and can be
compared with Kalidasa and Shankara in poetic renderings, with Vyasa in sutra
writings and with Patanjali, Shabara and Shankara in writing commentaries. The
writings of the Muni are not just some products of literary activities but
are the records of his unique Yogic experiences and subtle visions and will
be a guiding spirit and lamp for the centuries to come.
