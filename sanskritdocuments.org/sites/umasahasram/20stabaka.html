सर्वसारमयी  Essence of glorious form of Devi

मणिबन्धवृत्तम्  manibandha meter

In this stabaka, Devi, the essence of all that exists is being
praised. Glorious forms of the Devi, which are propounded in the holy texts,
which help the seekers to attain the summum bonum, are also depicted.

प्रीतिविकासे स्वल्पतमो रोषविशेषे भूरितरः |

अद्भुतहासो विश्वसुवो रक्षतु साधुं हन्तु खलम् ||२०. १||

May that wonderful smile of Devi, from which issues forth this universe
protect the good and destroy the evil. It is wonderful because it is so gentle
when meaning love and affection, very fierce in displaying indignation at
the time of destroying evil. ||20.1||

सज्जनचित्तानन्दकरी संश्रितपापव्रातहरी |

लोकसवित्री नाकचरी स्तान्मम भूयो भद्रकरी ||२०. २||

May the Mother of the universe, who moves about in higher realms of heaven,
who delights the minds of the noble, who removes the series of sins of those
who take resort in her, bless me with auspiciousness. ||20.2||

अर्चनकाले रूपगता संस्तुतिकाले शब्दगता |

चिन्तनकाले प्राणगता तत्त्वविचारे सर्वगता ||२०. ३||

In hour of worship she dwells in the image;
In hour of praise she becomes sound itself;
In hour of thought she is one with life;
In hour of reflection she becomes all. ||20.3||

``Each way leads to the Divine Mother in her corresponding truth''
MP Pandit.

उज्ज्वलरूपे नृत्यकरी निष्प्रभरूपे सुप्तिकरी |

गोपितरुपे सिद्धिकरी गोचररूपे बन्धकरी ||२०. ४||

You are a dancer in forms resplendent;
You lie dormant in dull forms, void of luster;
You work wonders in forms concealed;
In sensual objects you cause bondage. ||20.4||

She is everywhere. Good, bad, bright and dull in everything. She is
omnipresent. This entire world is her form total.

अम्बरदेशे शब्दवती पावकताते स्पर्शवती |

काञ्चनवीर्ये रूपवती सागरकाञ्च्यां गन्धवती ||२०. ५||

In space you are present in the form of sound; in air you assume the form
of touch; in fire you are the brilliant color; in earth you are present as
smell. ||20.5||

अप्स्वमलासु स्पष्टरसा चन्द्रविभायां गुप्तरसा |

संसृतिभोगे सर्वरसा पूर्णसमाधावेकरसा ||२०. ६||

In pure waters she is present as rasa is welldefined; in moonlight she
is rasa concealed; she is all the delights in the enjoyment of life; she is
the sole joy in trance complete. ||20.6||

The Divine as bliss is the one rasa that keeps all existence together, as
it is found in the Upanishads, raso vai sah. This basic delight manifests
itself in varied forms in creation the joy of power, of knowledge, of
beauty, of harmony, of service, of love and so on. These rasas depend upon
extraneous factors for their play. But the original rasa underlying all,
depends upon none, it is sole. This uncaused bliss is experienced in the
state of trance when all the senses are indrawn and the consciousness fully
selfgathered. (See.p.75. Adoration of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||
20.6||

चक्षुषि दृष्टिश्शाततमा चेतसि दृष्टिश्चित्रतमा |

आत्मनि दृष्टिश्शुद्धतमा ब्रह्मणि दृष्टिः पूर्णतमा ||२०. ७||

She is the bright light in the eye, she is the wondrous creation in the
mind's eye; in the inward look she is pure; In Brahma she is complete and
perfect. ||20.7||

Inward look is pure because it is natural. In Brahma she is complete
because he is the witness of all. ||20.7||

शीर्षसरोजे सोमकला भालसरोजे शक्रकला |

हार्दसरोजे सूर्यकला मूलसरोजे वह्निकला ||२०. ८||

Of Yogis best, you are the light of vision.
Of lords of earth, you are splendor of throne.

yogis of high order she is the light of knowledge piercing all veils of
ignorance and arriving at truth. Of the kings that rule and guard the realm,
she is the glory of exalted position. In the fair sex touched by love she
blossoms as beauty.
She is at once the power, knowledge, glory and beauty of the manifestation
on earth  (See.p.60. Adoration of the Divine Mother, MP Pandit). ||20.11||
