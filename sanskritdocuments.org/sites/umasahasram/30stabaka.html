प्रमाणिकावृत्तम्  Pramanika meter

Internal worship is established in this stabaka.

Sixteen steps of internal (manasika) worship of Devi such as Invoking and
Dhyaana are depicted in this 30th stabaka.

कृतेन सा निसर्गतो धृतेन नित्यमानने |

सितेन शीतशैलजा स्मितेन शं तनोतु मे ||३०. १||

Daughter of snow mountain with natural smile ever shining on her face may
bless me with happiness. ||30.1||

प्रतिक्षणं विनश्वरानये विसृज्य गोचरान् |

समर्चयेश्वरीं मनो विविच्य विश्वशायिनीम् ||३०. २||

Oh Mind! Leave all objects seen through sensory organs that are perishing
every minute and worship Devi who is residing in the entire universe, with
proper understanding. ||30.2||

First step of worship, dhyaana, is spoken of here. ||30.2||

विशुद्धदर्पणेन वा विधारिते हृदाऽम्ब मे |

अयि प्रयच्छ सन्निधिं निजे वपुष्यगात्मजे ||३०. ३||

Oh, Mother! grant me place in your own form while you reside in my heart
which is like a pure mirror. ||30.3||

Please grant me the vision of your form (as a reflection) residing in
my heart which is like a pure mirror. Second step of worship, `invoking'
(avahana) is talked about here. ||30.3||

पुरस्य मध्यमाश्रितं सितं यदस्ति पङ्कजम् |

अजाण्डमूल्यमस्तु ते सुरार्चिते तदासनम् ||३०. ४||

Oh Mother worshipped by gods! May my lotus heart, situated in the middle of
my physical form, be your seat, the origin of the entire universe. ||30.4||

Third step of worship, `offering seat' is told here. ||30.4||

अखण्डधारया द्रवन्नवेन्दुशेखरप्रिये |

मदीयभक्तिजीवनं दधातु तेऽम्ब पाद्यताम् ||३०. ५||

Oh Mother consort of Shiva! May the incessant flow of my devotion be the
water for washing your feet. ||30.5||

Fourth step of worship, `offering water for washing feet (paadya)' is
mentioned here.

विवासनौघमानसप्रसादतोयमम्ब मे |

समस्तराज्ञि हस्तयोरनर्घमर्घ्यमस्तु ते ||३०. ६||

Oh Mother empress of the entire universe! May the purity of my mind, devoid
of all worldly attachments be the offer of water to wash your hands. ||
30.6||

Fifth step of worship, `water to hands (arghya)' is cited here. ||30.6||

महेन्द्रयोनिचिन्तनाद् भवन्भवस्य वल्लभे |

Oh beloved of Shiva, please consume maharasa (ambrosia) that is formed
by contemplating on the source of ambrosia (mahendrayoni) for cleansing my
physical form. ||30.7||

Acording to yogic faith, maharasa (ambrosia) would be formed in indrayoni
(source of ambrosia) which is stationed on the path of Sushumna nadi when
an aspirant contemplates on it. Here the poet aspires that Devi would dwell
within him after his physical form is cleansed by her while accepting the
offer of maharasa (anandarasa) obtained from his yogasiddhi. The sixth step
of worship, `offering a drink (paaniya)' is suggested here. ||30.7||

सहस्रपत्रपङ्कजद्रवत्सुधाजलेन सा |

सहस्रपत्रलोचना पिनाकिनोऽभिषिच्यते ||३०. ८||

May the amritarasa that flows from Sahasrara chakra (lotus of thousand
petals) be abhishekajala (ceremonial bath) to Shiva's consort. ||30.8||

Seventh step of worship, `abhisheka' is told here. ||30.8||

ममार्जितं यदिन्द्रियैः सुखं सुगात्रि पञ्चभिः |

तदम्ब तुभ्यमर्पितं सुधाख्यपञ्चकायताम् ||३०. ९||

Oh Mother who has beautiful form! May the bliss (blissful experience)
obtained by my five sensory organs serve as your panchamrita  abhisheka
(anoint ing ) with five sweet ingredients. ||30.9||

Eighth step of worship, `panchamrita snaana' (anointing with five sweet
ingredients) is described here. ||30.9||

वसिष्ठगोत्रजन्मना द्विजेन निर्मितं शिवे |

इदं शरीरमेव मे तवास्तु दिव्यमंशुकम् ||३०. १०||

Oh Shive! May this physical form made by a brahmin of Vasishta gotra be
your divine robe. ||30.10||

An Acharya of high order can prepare his physical form worthy of being
a divine robe of Devi when he prepares his inner form to be a worthy place
for Devi's abode by the power of his Tapas.  Ninth step of worship, `offer
of clothing ' is voiced here. ||30.10||

विचित्रसूक्ष्मतन्तुभृन्ममेयमात्मनाडिका |

सुखप्रबोधविग्रहे मखोपवीतमस्तु ते ||३०. ११||

Oh Mother with the image of bliss and knowledge (chidananda sharire)! My
(sushumna) nerve that has wonderful suttle string be your sacred thread
(yajnopavita). ||30.11||

Tenth step of worship, `offering sacred thread (makhopavita/yajnopavita)'
is told here. ||30.11||

महद्विचिन्वतो मम स्वकीयतत्त्ववित्तिजम् |

इदं तु चित्तसौरभं शिवे तवास्तु चन्दनम् ||३०. १२||

Oh Shive! Consort of Lord Shiva! May this fragrance of my mind that has
got the knowledge as the result of contemplating on the highest Truth be
`chandana' (fragrant paste) to you. ||30.12||

The mind has become fragrant by enquiry into the highest Truth of the
world. Eleventh step of worship, `offering gandha  chandana (fragrant body
paste)' is cited here. ||30.12||

महेशनारिनिःश्वसँस्तथाऽयमुच्छ्वसँस्तदा |

तवानिशं समर्चको ममास्तु जीवमारुतः ||३०. १३||

Oh consort of Mahesha! May the life force (vital energy) through my breath
constantly moving along with inhalation and exhalation be the offer of flower
to you. ||30.13||

Commentary  Prabha interprets `samarchaka' as flower. Twelfth step of
worship with `flower' is mentioned here. ||30.13||

विपाककालपावकप्रदीप्तपुण्यगुग्गुलुः |

सुवासनाक्यधूपभृद् भवत्वयं ममाम्ब ते ||३०. १४||

Oh, Mother! may this guggulu  virtuous fruit (as result ) of perfoming
fire ritual (best deeds) at appropriate time by me be the offer of `dhupa'
(fragrant fume) to you. ||30.14||

Thirteenth step of worship, offer of `dhupa' is spoken of here. Guggulu,
the fruit (result) of performance of yajna or virtuous deeds has become the
fragrant fume offered to goddess. ||30.14||

गुहावतारमौनिना मयीश्वरि प्रदीपिता |

इयं प्रबोधदीपिका प्रमोददायिकाऽस्तु ते ||३०. १५||

Oh Ishvari! May this light of knowledge ignited in me by the sage of silence,
Ramana Maharshi who is incarnate of Guha (Skanda), be the light that pleases
you. ||30.15||

Fourteenth step of worship, `lighting of the lamp' is referred to here. ||
30.15||

इमामयि प्रियात्प्रियां महारसामहङ्कृतिम् |

निवेदयामि भुज्यतामियं त्वया निरामये ||३०. १६||

Oh, Mother! Who is unaffected by any ailment! I offer my ego, that is the
dearest of dear things, to you as food. ||30.16||

Devi is addressed as one who has no ailments because normally ego which
is offered here is believed to be afflicted with many impurities. But, the
epithet `maharasa' to `ahankritiego' suggests here that the poet's ego is
pure that is merged with consciousness. ||30.16||

Fifteenth step of worship, `offering food' is cited here. ||30.16||

सरस्वती सुधायते मनो दधाति पूगताम् |

हृदेव पत्रमम्बिके त्रयं समेत्य तेऽर्प्यते ||३०. १७||

Oh Ambike! My speech, mind and heart are offered to you as three ingredients
of `tambula  pan' viz., smearing of sweetness on leaf, arecanut and betal
leaf. ||30.17||

Sixteenth step of worship, `offer of `tambula  pan' is spoken of here. ||
30.17||

विनीलतोयदान्तरे विराजमानविग्रहा |

निजाविभूतिरस्तु ते तटिल्लता प्रकाशिका ||३०. १८||

Manifestation of your true form as Lightning amidst the blue sky be your
`nirajana  showing of the light'. ||30.18||

Here, the presence of Devi as lightning inside a human form is
suggested. Devi is praised as seated above six chakras. Offer of `nirajana',
the seventeenth form of worship, is talked about here. ||30.18||

स्वरोऽयमन्तरम्बिके द्विरेफवत्स्वरँस्तदा |

ममाभिमन्त्र्य धीसुमं ददाति देवि तेऽङ्घ्रये ||३०. १९||

Oh Ambike! May this inner voice which is constantly hovering like a
bee around my intellect  flower which is sanctified with the power of
consciousness, be at your feet. ||30.19||

Worship of any devata starts with the `avahana  invoking' and ends with
`visarjana' i.e., placing back at the original place, in the external image
worship. But, here the spiritual worship that takes place at all times is
described and the prayer ends with `mantrapushpa' by the mention of the word
`abhimantrya' after all the offerings are completed. ||30.19||

तवार्चनं निरन्तरं यतो विधातुमस्म्यहम् |

न विश्वनाथपत्नि ते विसर्जनं विधीयते ||३०. २०||

Oh wife of Vishvanatha! it is not proper to do visarjana as part of the
worship because I want to worship you at all times. ||30.19||

वियोग इन्दुधारिणा न चेह विश्वनायिके |

मदम्ब सोऽत्र राजते तटिल्लताशिखान्तरे ||३०. २१||

Oh, Mother! Empress of the universe! There will never be separation from your
husband, Shiva who is shining at the top of lightning (within me). ||30.19||

Shiva is dwelling in the skylike heart (hridayakasha). Devi, who is invoked,
is also there as lightning. Hence there is no separation between the couple. ||
30.19||

इदं शरीरमेककं विभाव्य नव्यमन्दिरम् |

विहारमत्र सेश्वरा भवानि कर्तुमर्हसि ||३०. २२||

Oh Bhavani, enjoy along with your husband, Ishwara by taking this form of
mine as your new abode. ||30.22||

`Seshvara  with Ishvara' is said here because Shiva's place is the heart
and the chief abode of Devi is sahasrara. ||30.22||

जडेष्विवालसेष्विव प्रयोजनं न निद्रया |

विहर्तुमेव याच्यसे हृदीशसद्मराज्ञि मे ||३०. २३||

Oh, Mother! Queen of Ishvara's abode! There is no use of sleeping within
people who are not conscious of your presence. I plead you to be (always)
active within me. ||30.23||

अयं तवाग्रिमः सुतः श्रितो मनुष्यविग्रहम् |

तनूजवेश्मसौष्ठवं मृडानि पश्य कीदृशम् ||३०. २४||

Oh, Mother! Your elder son (Ganesha) is in front of you taking human
form. Look at how good is your son's (mine) form (with enlightened soul). ||
30.24||

गणेशितुर्महाकवेरसौ प्रमाणिकावली |

मनोम्बुजे महेश्वरीप्रपूजनेषु शब्द्यताम् ||३०. २५||७५०

May these verses composed in Pramanika meter by the great poet Ganesha
(Vasishta Ganapati Muni) resonate in the minds of worshippers during their
worship of Maheshvari. ||30.25||
