ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS by TRANSLATOR</h3></b></center>

<P>
Let alone translating even understanding such a distinct litany inspired by
spiritual experience is not an easy job. It requires a good understanding
of the Sanskrit language and familiarity with the Tantric tradition and
literature. Perhaps realizing this difficulty T.V.K, a scholar par excellence
in Sanskrit and a worthy disciple of Ganapati Muni has rendered a great
service to the scholarly world by commenting upon the US. His commentary is
called `Prabha' which means `light'. Prabha throws the necessary light on
the original poem to reveal the essence therein in an extremely effective
manner. Without the lucid and insightful commentary in Sanskrit, Prabha,
it would have been very difficult to translate Umasahasram. Hence, we
acknowledge with grateful thanks the guidance provided to us by   Brahmarshi
T.V.K. through his Sanskrit commentary, Prabha.
<P>
Shri M.P. Pandit, who is another spiritual luminary in the line of Ramana
Parampara and an ardent disciple of T.V.K., has rendered hundred verses
selected from US into English in his book ADORATION OF THE DIVINE MOTHER. We
have received lot of benefit from his book. We have adopted his translations
of some of the Tantric terms into English in the present work. We have used
his translations wherever it deemed necessary and suitable. We owe a debt
of gratitude to Shri M.P. Pandit.
<P>
Dr.R.L.Kashyap, a wellknown Vedic scholar and founder of SAKSHI, Bengaluru,
introduced the present translators to the inspiring works of Kavyakantha
Ganapati Muni. It is only in the fitness of things that we thank him
wholeheartedly, for all the benefits we have received from this introduction.
