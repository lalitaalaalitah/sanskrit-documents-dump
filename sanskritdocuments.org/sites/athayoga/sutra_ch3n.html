    on the tip of the nose or of the tongue, or on such like spots in the body, or on
    any external object, by means of the modifications of the mind.&quot; </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Table-Contents-C">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C4">B</span><span class="Table-Contents-C"> says that the object that is the focus of concentration can be a seen object, a
    concept or idea easily accessible -<wbr> such as a question, problem, relationship or

    attachment, repulsion or fear.&quot; (see </span><span class="Normal-C">YS</span><span class="Table-Contents-C"> 2, 7-<wbr>9) He adds that &quot;in posture based yoga,
    a first step toward concentration is observation of the body and breath.&quot; This first
    step is clearly within the grasp of any yoga student, and probably the best one to
    begin with! </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Table-Contents-C">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C4">T</span><span class="Table-Contents-C"> begins with a reminder of the purpose of the first five &quot;limbs&quot; of yoga: <br>· </span><span class="Normal-C">yama</span><span class="Table-Contents-C">

    of similar mental modifications on the same object is confined to the desired place.
    But the thought-<wbr>process on the same object is intermittent and in succession. When
    through practice that becomes continuous, i.e. appears as an unbroken flow, then
    it is called </span><span class="Normal-C">dhyāna</span><span class="Table-Contents-C">…. It is a particular state of calmness of the mind and can be
    applied to any object of meditation. If flow of knowledge in </span><span class="Normal-C">dhāranā</span><span class="Table-Contents-C"> may be compared
    to succession of similar drops of water, in </span><span class="Normal-C">dhyāna</span><span class="Table-Contents-C"> the flow of knowledge is continuous

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Table-Contents-C">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C4">S</span><span class="Table-Contents-C"> makes a similar point. He also says that one sign that you really have been meditating
    is that you are unaware of the passage of time. If an hour passes and you think it
    was only five minutes, that&#39;s meditation; if five minutes pass and you feel it&#39;s
    an hour, that&#39;s just concentration. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Table-Contents-C">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C4">B</span><span class="Table-Contents-C"> says, &quot;With prolonged focus on one object, concentration becomes meditation, in

    When meditation is full of the object meditated on, i.e. when meditation becomes

    </span><span class="Normal-C">samādhi</span><span class="Table-Contents-C"> or concentration…. In plain language, when in the process of meditating,

    to exist, when the self is forgotten and the difference between the self and the
    object is effaced, such concentration of the mind on the object is called </span><span class="Normal-C">samādhi</span><span class="Table-Contents-C">.&quot;

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Table-Contents-C">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C4">D </span><span class="Table-Contents-C">says much the same: &quot;When we reach this state all that is evident is the object
