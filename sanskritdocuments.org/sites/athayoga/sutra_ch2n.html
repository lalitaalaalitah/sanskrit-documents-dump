<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C3">Commentary:</span><span class="Normal-C4"><br></span><span class="Normal-C">This sutra is an essential sutra for the student to understand. The translations
    above and the definitions of the individual words show that there is apparently a
    wide range of interpretations. However, I found that when you look closely at what
    the translators and commentators have to say, each one seems to supplement or complement
    to the others, so that eventually it is possible to come to an understanding of what
    Patanjali is saying here. One particularly important point, touched on by S and T
    in particular, is the connotation of &quot;heating&quot; or &quot;cooking&quot; in the word </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">. And
    another point of special interest is the differention made by </span><span class="Normal-C4">F </span><span class="Normal-C">between Kriya-<wbr>Yoga
    and the Karma-<wbr>Yoga of the </span><span class="Normal-C0">Bhagavad Gita</span><span class="Normal-C">.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">D says, &quot;The more we refine ourselves through Yoga the more we realise that all our
    actions need to be re-<wbr>examined systematically and we must not take the fruits of
    our actions for granted.&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">F comments as follows: &quot;The words </span><span class="Normal-C0">kriyā</span><span class="Normal-C">and </span><span class="Normal-C0">karma</span><span class="Normal-C">both mean &quot;action&quot;, but Kriya Yoga
    is different from the Karma-<wbr>Yoga of the </span><span class="Normal-C0">Bhagavad Gita</span><span class="Normal-C">. Karma-<wbr>Yoga is... the path
    of &quot;inaction in action&quot;, or ego-<wbr>transcending activity. Patanjali&#39;s Kriya-<wbr>Yoga is
    the path of ecstatic identification with the Self by which the subliminal activators
    (</span><span class="Normal-C0">samskāra</span><span class="Normal-C">), which maintain the individual consciousness, are gradually eliminated.
    [See Feuerstein, </span><span class="Normal-C0">The Yoga Tradition</span><span class="Normal-C">, pages 253-<wbr>255 for F&#39;s discussion of Karma-<wbr>Yoga.]</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">H gives a very useful and humanly manageable definition of </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">. He defines </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">as
    &quot;attempt to desist from actions which might bring momentary pleasures and putting
    up with the resulting hardship.&quot; He adds, &quot;That form of austerity which does not
    cause any pathological disturbance and which results in the non-<wbr>performance of actions
    based on attachment and antipathy, is favourable to Yoga.&quot;. He refers also to </span><span class="Normal-C0">YS</span><span class="Normal-C">2.32,
    and in a footnote also says &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">involves correct thinking, full control over one&#39;s
    turbid emotions, clear understanding of moral values and consequent purification
    of one&#39;s character.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">R notes that &quot;the word </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">has been translated as &quot;purificatory action&quot;, because
    </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">means that which burns up impurities.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">S observes that </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">is a term that is often misunderstood. &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C0">Tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">means &#39;to burn
    or create heat.&#39; Anything burned out will be purified.... But how can this burning
    process be effected with our mental impurities? By accepting all the pain that comes
    to us, even though the nature of the mind is to run after pleasure. We will actually
    be happy to receive pain if we keep in mind its purifying effects. Such acceptance
    makes the mind steady and strong because, although it is easy to give pain to others,
    it is hard to accept without returning it.&quot; And this sort of self-<wbr>discipline has
    to be practised in our daily lives. &quot;But </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">also refers to self-<wbr>discipline. This
    is not the self-<wbr>torture of sadhus lying on beds of nails. Self-<wbr>torture is an obstacle
    to progress, whereas self-<wbr>discipline is an aid to self progress.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><br>S refers to </span><span class="Normal-C0">BG</span><span class="Normal-C">17, in which Krishna talks about </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">, classifying 3 groups of </span><span class="Normal-C0">tapas</span><span class="Normal-C">-<wbr>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Of </span><span class="Normal-C0">svādhyāya</span><span class="Normal-C">, S explains that this means &quot;study that concerns the true Self&quot; -<wbr> it&#39;s
    not just analysing the mind and emotions. &quot;Anything that will elevate your mind and
    remind you of your true Self should be studied&quot; -<wbr> and study of this sort requies
    that you really understand and take to heart whatever you are studying. This entails
    reading and re-<wbr>reading, since each re-<wbr>reading elevates you a bit more. &quot;The more
    we elevate the mind, the better our understanding is.&quot; &quot;The Self cannot be known
    by theory alone.... Only when you transcend the mind can you understand it.... So,
    limit your reading and put into practice what you read.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">S explains īśvarapraṇidhāna as meaning &quot;dedicating the fruits of your actions to
    God or to humanity -<wbr> God in manifestation.&quot; &quot;Try not to possess anything for yourself.

    both these sutras serve different purposes. The difference between the Yoga outlook
    and the outlook of the ordinary person is so great that it is not possible to adopt
    the Yoga outlook all at once. &quot;A preparatory period of self-<wbr>training in which he
    gradually assimilates the Yogic philosophy and its technique and accustoms himself
    to self-<wbr>discipline makes the transition from the one life to the other easier and
    safer.&quot; It also gives the aspirant a chance to discover if (s)he is really suited
    to the Yogic life, since there&#39;s a lot of confusion over what the Yogic life really
    is. &quot;This preparatory self-<wbr>discipline is triple in its nature corresponding to the

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C3">Commentary: </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Patanjali is explaining why you should practise </span><span class="Normal-C0">kriyā-<wbr>yoga</span><span class="Normal-C">. There are two reasons:
    </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C">1. &nbsp;To work towards achieving </span><span class="Normal-C0">samādhi</span><span class="Normal-C"> (a term that was explained in some detail in
    </span><span class="Normal-C0">YS</span><span class="Normal-C"> I.40-<wbr>51, and which he returns to again in </span><span class="Normal-C0">YS</span><span class="Normal-C">II.29, 45; III.1-<wbr>12).</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P0"><span class="Normal-C">2. To work towards a reduction in the causes of suffering. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">These two things are so closely linked that they work together. If you begin by working
    on reduction in causes of suffering, this naturally makes it gradually easier to
    attain a good quality of concentration because the mind becomes calmer. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">As B says, &quot;What links these objectives is realizing that concentration is impossible
    unless we reduce our personal problems and suffering.&quot; B also points out that P mentions
    </span><span class="Normal-C0">samādhi</span><span class="Normal-C">(something to strive for) before mentioning the </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas</span><span class="Normal-C">(something we must reduce
    and try to eliminate). So we see the carrot before we feel the stick. T comments,
    &quot;The more the </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas</span><span class="Normal-C">are attenuated the greater becomes the capacity of the </span><span class="Normal-C0">sadhaka</span><span class="Normal-C">[spiritual
    practitioner] to practise samāand the nearer he draws to his goal of </span><span class="Normal-C0">kaivalya</span><span class="Normal-C">[liberation].&quot;
    </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C4">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">V&#39;s commentary is useful. He says, &quot;When </span><span class="Normal-C0">Kriyā-<wbr>Yoga</span><span class="Normal-C">is properly performed, it conduces
    to the state of samAdhi and considerably attenuates all the kleśas. The fire of </span><span class="Normal-C0">Prasaṃkhyāna</span><span class="Normal-C">or
    discriminative knowledge sterilises the attenuated kleśas like roasted seeds. When
    they are attenuated, they cannot obscure the realisation of the distinction between
    </span><span class="Normal-C0">Buddhi</span><span class="Normal-C">and </span><span class="Normal-C0">Puruṣa</span><span class="Normal-C">. Such realisation then lapses in the absence of the manifestation

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Another key sutra. As T says, &quot;The philosophy of </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśās</span><span class="Normal-C"> is really the foundation
    of the system of yoga outlined by Patanjali. It is necessary to understand this philosophy
    thoroughly because it provides a satisfactory answer to the initial and pertinent
    question, &#39;Why should we practise yoga?&#39; The philosophy of </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśās</span><span class="Normal-C"> is not peculiar
    to this system of Yoga. In its essential ideas it forms the substratum of all schools

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>

    these causes of suffering. T says, &quot;The relation existing between the five </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas</span><span class="Normal-C">

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">S (p. 86) gives a nice illustration of the different stages: &quot;Imagine there is a
    nice performance at a night club. A friend is going, and he invites you to come.
    Let&#39;s say you feel drawn to go, but finally you decide, &#39;I have seen hundreds of
    shows like that; what can I gain by another one? No. I&#39;m going to a Raja Yoga lecture
    instead.&#39; The obstacle is there but you overpower it. That is the &#39;intercepted&#39; stage.
    &quot;If you continue with such discipline, the obstacle will sink to the bottom; but,
    since a trace will still be there, occasionally you&#39;ll be reminded of it. &#39;Why shouldn&#39;t
    I go to a club?&#39; A gentle trace will arise, which you can easily overpower. &#39;No,
    I&#39;m not going.&#39; It just comes up to remind you, &#39;I&#39;m still here.&#39; That is the feeble
    stage. &quot;In the case of average people, the moment a night club is thought of, both
    legs immediately go toward it and the people simply follow. From there, they probably
    go to an adjoining bar and so on. In their cases the obstacles are &#39;sustained&#39;.&quot;

    are drawn involuntarily and unconsciously towards objects, and the power to consciously
    restrain desire disappears. That is why attachment is regarded as a kind of misapprehension.
    By this the Self gets linked up with the senses and their objects. Here the misapprehension
    is to regard the detached Self as bound up with the latent impressions of pleasure

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Having completed his description of the </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas</span><span class="Normal-C">, P now proposes (in </span><span class="Normal-C0">YS </span><span class="Normal-C">II.10-<wbr>11) two
    ways of working towards their reduction. First (sutra 10) you can work at eliminating
    those that are latent, or just about to appear. This requires a well-<wbr>developed awareness
    of the potential of the </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas </span><span class="Normal-C">to take root in us. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">V says &quot;Those five </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas </span><span class="Normal-C">become like parched seed and disappear with the mind of
    the Yogin, which having fulfilled the purpose of its existence becomes defunct.&quot;
    H explains -<wbr> parched seeds can&#39;t germinate. The </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas </span><span class="Normal-C">reach this state once you
    realise &quot;I am neither the body nor the senses&quot;, because once you have attained this
    knowledge, no disorder of the body or the senses can affect the mind. &quot;The </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas
    </span><span class="Normal-C">so reduced disappear with the mind.&quot; [N.B. This for most of us is a distant goal,
    because the disappearance of the mind marks the end of birth, life and further experience.]
    </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">T has a lot to say which is quite helpful. The </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas </span><span class="Normal-C">exist in two states -<wbr> active
    and potential. The active state is easy to recognise and thus easier to deal with.
    Through the practice of </span><span class="Normal-C0">Kriyā Yoga kleśas </span><span class="Normal-C">become dormant; but under certain conditions
    they can become active again, so they have to be &quot;parched&quot; and thus rendered completely
    inactive. T also explains &quot;resolving them back to their origin&quot; (</span><span class="Normal-C0">pratiprasava</span><span class="Normal-C">) as
    follows: the five </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas </span><span class="Normal-C">evolve, each from the one before it, beginning with </span><span class="Normal-C0">avidyā
    </span><span class="Normal-C">and ending with </span><span class="Normal-C0">abhiniveśa</span><span class="Normal-C">. So to eliminate them all you begin with </span><span class="Normal-C0">abhiniveśa</span><span class="Normal-C">, work
    back through the other </span><span class="Normal-C0">kleśas </span><span class="Normal-C">in reverse order to </span><span class="Normal-C0">avidyā</span><span class="Normal-C">, and once avidya is eliminated
    you have enlightenment! But since the seeds are latent, they present a potential
    danger right up until the achievement of Enlightenment. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">Therefore, as D warns in his note, &quot;A temporary state of clarity should not be confused
    with a permanent state. To assume then that everything will be free from now on can
    be fraught with danger. It is now even more important to be careful. The fall from
    clarity to confusion is more disturbing than a state with no clarity at all.&quot; So
    always be vigilant. Don&#39;t let your practice slip (refer back to </span><span class="Normal-C0">YS </span><span class="Normal-C">I.12-<wbr>16 for more
    on practice and detachment). As B says, &quot;This aphorism warns us not to neglect the
