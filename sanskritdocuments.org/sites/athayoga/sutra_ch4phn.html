<p class="-heading-1-P" style="margin-top:0px"><span class="-heading-1-C">Some Notes on Yoga Sutras, Chapter 4</span></p>
<p class="-heading-1-P"><span class="-heading-3-C">Introduction</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">In August 2000 I joined about 30 other people at a Viniyoga Open Retreat in Gloucestershire,
    led by Paul Harvey. The one-<wbr>week retreat was, as always, a well-<wbr>balanced blend of
    asana, pranayama, meditation and textual study. Paul is an excellent teacher; he
    has a profound knowledge of yoga philosophy, but makes it all easy to understand.
    The text we studied was Chapter 4 of the Yoga Sutras, not one that is usually given
    much attention. I had tried to read it before, without much success, but I now find
    that its meaning has become clearer. The following notes are based on Paul&#39;s teaching
    during the retreat, and any errors and obscurities are mine. You will probably find
    the notes easier to follow if you have a copy of Patanjali to refer to as you read.</span></p>
<p class="-heading-1-P"><span class="-heading-3-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="-heading-1-P"><span class="-heading-3-C">OUTLINE OF TOPICS DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 4</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">1. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = cause for change (1-<wbr>3). Everything is there in the intelligence. You
    just have to find the intelligence to find the intelligence. So verses 1-<wbr>3 talk about
    the tools, materials and intelligence. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">2. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">asmita</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> (4-<wbr>7). Verses 4-<wbr>7 talk about the quality and importance of the link with
    </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C">. The link is through ego (</span><span class="Body-Text-C0">asmita</span><span class="Body-Text-C">) and the openness of the link determines
    its quality. The ego is the channel of communication. But when the ego gets in the
    way, the communication is impaired. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">3. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">vasana</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = smells/seeds (8-<wbr>11). These verses develop another theme -<wbr> the influence
    of the past. Our past gets in the way. Sometimes our past is not relevant. The </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">vasana</span><span class="Body-Text-C">
    will roll round again and again. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">4. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">guna</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = qualities (12-<wbr>14). The </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">guna</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> change all the time, and trigger </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">vasana</span><span class="Body-Text-C">. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">5. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">uparaga</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = attractiveness, interest (15-<wbr>17). Our perception varies according to
    our interest in a given object. Our mood can change: it depends on what glitters
    for us. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">6. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">purusha</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = the Self (18-<wbr>22). The source of perception is something deeper: something
    variously known as </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">purusha/ drstr/ atma/ cit</span><span class="Body-Text-C">. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">7. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">vishesha darshana </span><span class="Body-Text-C">(23-<wbr>29). A special quality of seeing arises in someone who has
    practised yoga for some time. The past no longer influences us as it has normally
    done. When you are in such a state, then </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">dharma megha samadhi</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = contemplation-<wbr>cloud-<wbr>harmony</span><span class="Body-Text-C0">.</span><span class="Body-Text-C">
    </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">8. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nivritti </span><span class="Body-Text-C">= stopping (30-<wbr>33). Then the old cycles of past-<wbr>present are cut. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P1"><span class="Body-Text-C">9. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">citshakti</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = the power of </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">cit</span><span class="Body-Text-C">/Awareness (34) We are established in the power of
    the </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">cit</span><span class="Body-Text-C">. This is what Theos Bernard describes: &quot;What the mind accomplishes is of
    little consequence, what matters is that the inner self should experience an accession
    of power, that universal energy called </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">cit</span><span class="Body-Text-C">, which is the life source of the individual.&quot;
    </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P2"><span class="Body-Text-C">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="-heading-1-P"><span class="-heading-3-C">NOTES ON CHAPTER 4</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C1">4.1</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">There are 5 different ways in which the fruits described in </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">YS</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> Chapter 3 can come:</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">1. Some people are born with this ability (</span><span class="Body-Text-C0">janma</span><span class="Body-Text-C">). </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">2. Through taking certain herbs in a special way (</span><span class="Body-Text-C0">oshadhi</span><span class="Body-Text-C">). [N.B. The special way
    is no longer known. Taking herbs without doing it in this special way and without
    special preparation is dangerous.] </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">3. Chanting (</span><span class="Body-Text-C0">mantra</span><span class="Body-Text-C">) can change one’s state of mind. The chanting can be very complex.
    </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">4. Austerities (</span><span class="Body-Text-C0">tapas</span><span class="Body-Text-C">) can bring power and change perceptions. This is why </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">tapas</span><span class="Body-Text-C">
    is mentioned as a tool in </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">YS</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> 2.1. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">Tapas</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> needs to be linked to a purpose, so that
    the heat can be redirected. There has to be reflection as well as restraint; you
    have to reflect on the effect of the restraint on yourself and on others. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P1"><span class="Body-Text-C">5. the practice of yoga (</span><span class="Body-Text-C0">samadhi</span><span class="Body-Text-C">). N.B. The practice of </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">tapas</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> also appears in yoga,
    but it’s a different kind of </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">tapas</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> -<wbr> it appears in a different context [in </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">YS</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> 2].
    </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C"><br></span><span class="Body-Text-C1">4.2</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">Patanjali talks about the process of how something changes. The possibilities are
    already there: it’s up to you to make the changes. So we all have the potential for
    change. This change is a rearrangement of what already exists. You can expose different
    people to the same influences, and they will respond or change in different ways.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C"><br></span><span class="Body-Text-C1">4.3</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">We all have the same potential for change. We are, metaphorically speaking, all made
    of the same clay. To make something different out of this clay, a wheel is needed,
    but this is no use without a potter; the skill of the potter is crucial. </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">Patanjali uses the word </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = cause for change; in the &quot;clay&quot; metaphor, the potter
    is </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta. Nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> can be many things -<wbr> </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">dharma</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> or </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">duhkha</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> for example. To start with,
    </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta </span><span class="Body-Text-C">is an external force, but this external force must itself also be linked
    to some </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta;</span><span class="Body-Text-C">e.g. in early life, our teachers, parents or friends can be </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C">.
    The best </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> is your teacher. The teacher’s role is to lead you to your own internal
    </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C">; the teacher will assess you and provide you with appropriate tools.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">The mind is </span><span class="Body-Text-C1">not</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> the </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> in yoga. Yoga uses 4 terms to describe the internal </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C">:</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">1. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">drshtr</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = Seer -<wbr> it sees everything, but always perceives through the mind, therefore
    what it sees is coloured by the mind; </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">2. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">purusha</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = Dweller in the City -<wbr> the city being the mind, body and senses); </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P0"><span class="Body-Text-C">3. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">atma</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = Essence </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P1"><span class="Body-Text-C">4. </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">cit</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> = Awareness -<wbr> the quality of awareness depends on the quality of the mind.
    </span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">The purpose of yoga is to turn the mind from looking out to looking in. The mind
    will fill with anything. When you begin to turn the mind round to look inward, at
    first the mind will fill with itself and its own rubbish. The way forward is stated
    in </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">YS</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> 2.1, and requires changes in practice, lifestyle and attitude.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C"><br></span><span class="Body-Text-C1">4.4</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text-P"><span class="Body-Text-C">A person who has contact with his/her own </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">nimitta</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> will have the ability to influence
    other people -<wbr> i.e. this person can change other people’s states of mind. The link

<p class="Body-Text-P2"><span class="Body-Text-C">Perception is always through the mind. The state of perception depends on the state

    attachments (including attachment to clarity) have to be dropped. That’s why </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">YS</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> 1.50
    says there are positive </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">samskara </span><span class="Body-Text-C">that can block negative ones; and </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">YS</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> 1.51 says that

    In this state there is nothing to be known, nothing to be sought, nothing to be gained,
    and nothing to be realised. At this point the </span><span class="Body-Text-C0">vasana</span><span class="Body-Text-C"> are no longer active -<wbr> &quot;the

<p class="Body-Text-P2"><span class="Body-Text-C">When change stops, the mind has the ability to recognise the process of change. The
    mind experiences a series of moments; but because the replacement of each one happens
    so fast, we don’t see it (e.g. cartoon film). But the mind is constant, even with
    change. When you step back mentally, you can see the series of moments, and time
    seems to change its nature.</span></p>
