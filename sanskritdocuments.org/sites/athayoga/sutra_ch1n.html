<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C5">Commentary:</span><span class="Normal-C6"><br>The word &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">atha</span><span class="Normal-C6">&quot; indicates a commitment on the part of the student, and
    on the part of the teacher. It makes it clear that the study of yoga is going to
    start NOW. This isn&#39;t just intellectual study -<wbr> it includes practice as well. It
    is also study in which the teacher passes on what he himself learned from his teacher;
    so the tradition is very old. V identifies five states of mind, in all of which concentration
    (</span><span class="Normal-C7">samadhi</span><span class="Normal-C6">) is possible: restless, stupefied, distracted, one-<wbr>pointed and arrested
    (see B, p. 4 for more details). However V points out that the &quot;one-<wbr>pointed&quot; state
    is the only one from which progress towards enlightenment is possible. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C">S stresses that &quot;It&#39;s not mere philosophy that Patanjali is about to expound, but
    rather direct instruction on how to practice yoga.&quot; Without practice, nothing can
    be achieved.</span></p>

    the inhibition of the modifications of the mind.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C5">Commentary:</span><span class="Normal-C6"><br>S explains that </span><span class="Normal-C7">citta</span><span class="Normal-C6"> is &quot;the sum total of mind&quot;. That is, it contains
    three levels of mental activity:<br>1. </span><span class="Normal-C7">ahamkāra</span><span class="Normal-C6"> or &quot;ego&quot; the sense of being &quot;me&quot;.<br>2. </span><span class="Normal-C7">buddhi</span><span class="Normal-C6">
    or &quot;intellect&quot;. That is, the higher, intuitive mind. <br>3. </span><span class="Normal-C7">manas</span><span class="Normal-C6"> or &quot;lower mind&quot;. That
    is, the part of the mind that links with the senses.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C10"><br></span><span class="Normal-C6">It is the link with the senses that triggers off the modifications of the mind. Therefore
    if you can control these modifications you will not be bound by the outside world.
    D&#39;s translation seems to fit very well with this explanation. D adds an explanation
    that the object in question can be internal or external; it can be concrete or abstract.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">I confess that T&#39;s explanation is so abstruse that I find it difficult to understand.
    The way I understand it is, the mind is always busy -<wbr> so busy that in a sense you
    &quot;can&#39;t see the wood for the trees&quot;. If you can find a way of reducing mental traffic
    to a single steady thought-<wbr>stream, through yoga, the efficacy of the mind increases
    exponentially. (For which, see the next sutra.)</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">Note that Patanjali&#39;s definition of yoga is purely about mind. In the west, people
    tend to think of yoga simply as </span><span class="Normal-C7">āsana</span><span class="Normal-C6">-<wbr>based. However, yoga is not a spiritual practice
    and nothing else. It enables spiritual practice. It&#39;s really a practical psychology
    -<wbr> a tool for training the mind. In Indian traditional culture, Ayurveda is for the
    body; Yoga is for the mind; Vedānta is for the spirit. </span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C5">Commentary:</span><span class="Normal-C6"><br>The word </span><span class="Normal-C7">draṣṭuḥ </span><span class="Normal-C6">needs careful explaining. It means </span><span class="Normal-C7">&quot;seer&quot; or &quot;that which
    sees&quot;. </span><span class="Normal-C6">This is the real &quot;me&quot;, whose reality is usually clouded by the fluctuating
    mind. Another word for this Seer/Self is </span><span class="Normal-C7">puruṣa</span><span class="Normal-C6">, defined by Feuerstein, p. 608, as
    &quot;the transcendental Self, Spirit, or pure Awareness, as opposed to the finite personality.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">S explains, &quot;You are that true Seer. You are not the body nor the mind. You are the
    Knower or Seer. You always see your mind and body acting in front of you. You know
    that the mind creates thoughts; it distinguishes and desires. The Seer </span><span class="Normal-C7">knows</span><span class="Normal-C6"> that
    but is not involved in it.&quot; He compares the mind to a mirror which usually provides
    an imperfect reflection when the Seer looks in it, and which can provide a true reflection
    only when the mind is still. This is the state we should ideally be in.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">V says, &quot;At that time pure Consciousness -<wbr> the Seer -<wbr> abides in its own self, as
    it does in the state of liberation.&quot; H explains: &quot;Pure Consciousness is the impartial
    witness of Buddhi and the latter appears to it as an object. The dominant Buddhi
    is the sense of &#39;I&#39;&quot; H also explains that complete cessation of all fluctuations
    is the state of </span><span class="Normal-C7">kaivalya</span><span class="Normal-C6"> (see </span><span class="Normal-C7">YS</span><span class="Normal-C6"> Chapter 4). &quot;In </span><span class="Normal-C7">Nirodha</span><span class="Normal-C6">, suppression is for a temporary

    That which leads to rebirth and flows down the plane of undiscriminative ignorance
    is the stream of sin. Among the modifications the flow of the desirables is thinned
    by desirelessness; the flow of discrimination is rendered visible by habituating
    the mind to the experience of knowledge. Hence suppression of the mental modification

    that is necessary if we want to avoid all deviations. We have to be vigilant in all
    aspects of our lives -<wbr> the food we eat, our relationships and activities. This persevering
    practice is a kind of &quot;intelligent apprenticeship&quot; that &quot;keeps us on our toes&quot; regardless
    of obstacles in our way. It implies regular questioning of all aspects of our environment,
    including diet, relationships, etc. It also implies steering a straight course with
    neither too little nor too much energy, in spite of the continually eddying currents
    of our personal leanings and outside circumstances.&quot;</span></p>

    sometimes shared with other systems, sometimes unique. T adds that since yoga is
    an experimental science, new techniques are constantly being devised and taught.
    In this way each advanced teacher &quot;imparts a personal touch&quot; to the teaching by adding
    some minor practices of his own.</span></p>

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">V defines </span><span class="Normal-C7">sthiti</span><span class="Normal-C6"> as &quot;absence of fluctuations or undisturbed calmness&quot;and &quot;practice&quot;
    as &quot;the effort, the energy and the enthusiasm ... for achieving that state.&quot; [Which
    seems to indicate that he is putting strong emphasis on &quot;exertion&quot;.] H expands on
    this by saying &quot;The continuity of the mind devoid of all fluctuations is called </span><span class="Normal-C7">Praśānta</span><span class="Normal-C6">-<wbr></span><span class="Normal-C7">vāhitā</span><span class="Normal-C6">.
    That is the highest state of tranquillity of the mind; the other forms of calmness
    are only secondary. As the practice improves, the tranquillity also increases. With

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C5">Some Preliminary Thoughts :</span><span class="Normal-C6"><br>This seems to me to be a very important sutra, but there
    is so much in it that you need a long time to study it and -<wbr> eventually -<wbr> to understand
    it. </span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">First you need to try and understand what the meaning of &quot;obstacles&quot; (</span><span class="Normal-C7">antarāyāḥ</span><span class="Normal-C6">)
    actually is, and that&#39;s not easy! These &quot;obstacles&quot; are not the same as the &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">kleśas</span><span class="Normal-C6">&quot;
    of YS 2.3, so S is not helpful in using &quot;obstacle&quot; as a translation for antarayaH
    in YS 1.30 as well! My understanding of the difference is this: The &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">kleśas</span><span class="Normal-C6"> &quot; are
    things that get in the way of proper understanding -<wbr> they are aspects of the &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">viparyaya</span><span class="Normal-C6">&quot;
    (misapprehension) that is listed in YS 1.6 as one of the modifications of the mind.
    But the &quot;obstacles&quot; (</span><span class="Normal-C7">antarāyāḥ</span><span class="Normal-C6">) of YS 1.30 are things that interrupt or hold back
    your progress in yoga; they are not so much things OF the mind (which have an effect
    like a distorting mirror so that you can&#39;t see clearly) as things that AFFECT the
    mind (which you are probably more aware of). If this explanation is right, it means
    that the nine &quot;obstacles&quot; of YS1.30 are easier to confront and maybe reduce or eliminate
    than the five &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">kleśas</span><span class="Normal-C6"> &quot; whose presence you may not even be aware of. I think it also
    means that reduction or elimination of the &quot;obstacles&quot; is a way of beginning to reduce
    and eliminate the &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">kleśas</span><span class="Normal-C6"> &quot;.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C5">Commentary:</span><span class="Normal-C6"><br>S says these are kind of like a chain. The first obstacle is physical
    disease; this has an effect on your mind, making it weaker, and thus open to doubt;
    and so on. He also makes quite a good point -<wbr> that it&#39;s a natural law that we need
    to be challenged in order to understand our own capacities. If we overcome an obstacle
    we become stronger.</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">D simply comments, &quot;The more we are vulnerable to these interruptions the more difficult
    it is to reach a state of Yoga.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">V says that the nine obstacles &quot;arise with the fluctuations of the mind&quot; and that
    if they are absent, &quot;the fluctuations do not arise.&quot; He also explains what each of
    the nine words means (I am missing this bit out as I hope that the double-<wbr>definition
    of each word above in the Translation section has done this job already). H has quite
    a helpful explanation of V. He says &quot;Destruction of the impediments and the mind
    being fully concentrated are the same thing.&quot; He then shows that you really have
    to tackle these obstacles in order, beginning with bodily ailments, (a point similar
    to S&#39;s &quot;chain&quot;) and suggests that the best means to tackle each obstacle is &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">vīrya</span><span class="Normal-C6">&quot;
    (energy, enthusiasm, vitality).</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">T, for once, has an explanation that I can easily understand. He says that the average
    person has a mind that is constantly turned outwards towards what is going on in
    the world, and is thus easily and constantly distracted. But a Yogin has to develop
    an inward-<wbr>turned mind, free from the delusory impressions of the outer world.. The
    nine obstacles are all things that are likely to deflect the yogin from his purpose
    by drawing his attention to the things of the outer world. T then goes on to explain
    each of the obstacles in some detail. Finally he says that these nine &quot;obstacles&quot;
    are obstacles of a particular type -<wbr> Patanjali called them &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">cittavikṣepāḥ</span><span class="Normal-C6">&quot; -<wbr> which
    hinder the practice of &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">dhāranā</span><span class="Normal-C6">&quot;, &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">dhyāna</span><span class="Normal-C6">&quot; and &quot;</span><span class="Normal-C7">samadhi</span><span class="Normal-C6">&quot;. As T points out, &quot;There
    are other kinds of obstacles too. Every serious defect of character can become an
    obstacle. Karma can place obstacles in the path of the aspirant which make the practice
    of Yoga for the time being impossible. . . . These different kinds of obstacles are
    dealt with in their proper places.&quot; Patanjali is dealing with these nine obstacles
    in this Chapter because it is the &quot;Samadhi Pada&quot;, and he has to discuss all the factors
    involved in understanding &quot;Samadhi&quot;.</span></p>

    of the mind to run constantly after a multitude of objects in the outer world and

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">S points out that the nature of the object of concentration doesn&#39;t matter; it&#39;s
    the goal that matters. &quot;Stick to one thing and forge ahead with that. Why do you
    want to have this one-<wbr>pointed concentration? To make the mind clear so you can transcend
    it. You are not going to cling to the object but just use it as a ladder to climb
    up.&quot; S also points out that P &quot;is interested in the goal and not the paths.&quot; P suggests
    various paths, but leaves it to you to choose the path that suits you. &quot;That is why
    yoga is appreciated by everyone. Nobody can deny the Yoga philosophy because it has
    something to suit everyone.&quot; He uses the metaphor of digging a well to illustrate
    this point: &quot;There&#39;s no value in digging shallow wells in a hunderd places. Decide
    on one place and dig deep. Even if you encounter a rock, use dynamite and keep going
    down.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C0">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">H comments on the interpretation of </span><span class="Normal-C7">eka tattva</span><span class="Normal-C6"> = one principle/reality. He says that
    the &quot;quality of contemplation&quot; is of more importance than the object of contemplation&quot;.
    You can choose whatever object you like, but it should be the only object of contemplation.
    He does suggest that &quot;for practice of one principle, </span><span class="Normal-C7">Īśvara</span><span class="Normal-C6"> and I-<wbr>sense [</span><span class="Normal-C7">ahamkāra</span><span class="Normal-C6">]
    are best, but that it&#39;s really up to the individual to choose. By concentrating on
    one principle &quot;the mind easily gets tranquil. When it is co-<wbr>ordinated with inhalation
    and exhalation of breath, ordinary breathing turns into Yogic breathing and when

<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">V explains: &quot;Exhaling or expulsion is the ejection of the internal air through the
    apertures of the nose by a special kind of effort. Restraining or Pranayama is retention
    of the breath. The mind can also be calmed or stabilised by these methods.&quot;<br>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6">H stresses that breathing practice must be accompanied by an attempt to make the
    mind vacant; this calms the mind. He also says that exhalation is the key: the body
    and chest must be kept still, with the abdominal muscles only responsible for inhalation
    and exhalation. &quot;Then, to remain as far as possible in that vacant state of the mind
    is Pranayama.&quot; It is during exhalation that you can get the feeling of the ego disentangling
    itself from the body. &quot;To practise this method, the breath should be exhaled with
    prolonged and appropriate effort. The whole body and the chest should be kept still
    and inhalation and exhalation should be done by the movement of abdominal muscles.
    When this is practised assiduously for some time, a happy feeling or feeling of lightness
    spreads all over the body.&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C6"><br>S is a bit less prescriptive, simply pointing out that , &quot;whatever be the agitation
    in the mind, regulating the breath will help.&quot; In other words, by regulating the
    breath, we can control the mind. S also says that though some pranayama specialists
    say that Patanjali referred to holding the breath out, Patanjali didn&#39;t go into detail
    about breathing exercises, and probably just meant that we should watch and regulate
    the breath. <br>T refers to </span><span class="Internet-link-C0">YS II 49-<wbr>53</span><span class="Normal-C6"> for more on Pranayama, saying that in I 34, P

    is a definite reason for this. In the first place a beginner who is still trying
    to acquire steadiness of mind is not likely to derive much benefit from meditation
