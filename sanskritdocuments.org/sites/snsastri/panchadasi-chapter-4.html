</span>In this chapter the duality created by Isvara and that created by the
Jiva are described and differentiated. This will show what is the cause of
bondage and what has to be rejected by the aspirant for liberation.<o:p>

</span>The Svetasvatara Upanishad says (4.10) : &quot;Know Maya to be Prakriti
and Brahman associated with Maya as Isvara&quot;. Isvara is the creator of the
universe. The Aitareya Upanishad says that before creation there was Atman (i.e.
Brahman ) alone. He willed, &quot;Let me create&quot;, and He created the world
by His will. The Taittiriya Upanishad says that from the Self or Brahman arose
in succession ether, air, fire, water, earth, vegetation, food and bodies.
Isvara willed, &quot;Let me become many, let me create&quot;, and meditated and
thus created the universe. The Chandogya Upanishad says that before creation
Brahman alone existed as pure Existence. He desired to become many and created
fire, water, earth and all living beings such as those born of eggs, those born
from wombs, etc. The Mundaka Upanishad says that from the immutable Brahman
arose the various sentient beings and insentient objects, in the same way as
sparks emanate from a blazing fire. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad says that
before it became manifest the universe existed in an unmanifest state. It
assumed names and forms and manifested as Virat. From Virat came into being the
Manus, human beings, cattle, asses, horses, goats, etc, of both sexes, down to
ants. According to these Srutis Isvara entered into all these bodies as the Jiva.
The Jiva is so called because it bears Prana, or the vital air. The Jiva is a
blend of the substratum or Pure Consciousness, the subtle body and the
reflection of Pure Consciousness in the subtle body. Maya, which is the Power of
Isvara, has, in addition to the power to create, also the power to delude. The
latter deludes the Jiva. The Jiva, thus deluded, identifies himself with the
body, considers himself to be a limited, helpless being and thus becomes subject
to grief. What has been described so far is the duality created by Isvara. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The duality created by the Jiva is described in the section known as
Sapta-anna Brahmana of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The Jiva creates seven
kinds of food (or objects of experience) by his actions and meditations. Of
these seven, one kind is meant for human beings in general, two for the gods,
one for animals and the remaining three for himself. Grains such as wheat are
for human beings. The ingredients of the full-moon and new-moon sacrifices are
for the gods. Milk is for animals. The mind, speech and vital airs (Prana) are
for the Jiva himself. These are the seven kinds of food created by the Jiva.
Though these objects are also created by Isvara, the Jiva converts them into
objects of enjoyment for himself and so they are spoken of here as the creations
of the Jiva. The idea is that each Jiva creates his own world by his actions and
thoughts in previous births and so whatever objects he experiences and whatever
joys he enjoys and sorrows he suffers, are all the result of his own actions and
thoughts.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>An object such as a gem, which is a creation of Isvara, always remains
the same, but the attitude of each individual human being towards it differs.
The man who gets possession of it feels happy, while another man who has not got
it is sad. A third man, who is indifferent to such objects, feels neither happy
nor sad. The feelings of happiness, sorrow and indifference are created by the
respective Jivas towards the gem, but the nature of the gem as created by God
does not undergo any change. Similarly the attitudes of different persons
towards the same woman differ, depending on whether he is her father or brother
or husband or a stranger. Correspondingly the attitude of the same woman towards
each of these different persons will be different, depending on her relationship
with them. Thus, while the physical body of the woman as well the other men
remains the same, the mind of each of them undergoes changes in accordance with
their relationships. These changes are created by the Jivas. Thus each human
being or Jiva has two aspects, the material and the mental. It is this mental
aspect, which is the creation of each Jiva, that is the cause of bondage. Each
Jiva develops likes and dislikes towards various objects. depending on his
mental attitude which is governed by the impressions (called Vasanas) left by
his own past actions. These likes and dislikes are the cause of joy and sorrow.
In dream a person experiences joys and sorrows because of objects conjured up by
the mind, though there are no external objects. In deep sleep, when the mind
does not function, no joy or sorrow is felt by the person, even if there are
objects by his side which can cause joy, sorrow, fear, anger, etc. Thus it is
clear that it is the mind that is the cause of joys and sorrows and not other
persons or objects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A person whose son had gone to a far-off country was wrongly informed by
some one that the son had died. Though this information was wrong, the father
was plunged in sorrow. At the same time, his neighbour, whose son it was who had
died in a foreign country, remained calm, believing that his son was safe. This
shows that the real cause of a man's bondage and sorrow is the mind and not any
actual event. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Unlike the Buddhist Vijnanavadins, Advaita accepts the existence of
external objects and holds that, in perception, the mind takes the form of the
external object. It may be argued that, since it is the mind that causes bondage
by projecting the phenomenal world, the world could be made to disappear by
controlling the mind through the practice of yoga. The answer to this is that
though duality can be made to disappear temporarily by control of the mind,
final elimination of bondage is not possible without the realization of Brahman,
which alone will destroy Nescience (avidya). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even after the realization of Brahman, the duality created by Isvara will
continue to be perceived by the Jnani, but he will not be affected by it, since
he has realized their unreality. Once a person has been convinced that the water
that appears in a mirage is illusory, he will no longer go after it, though the
water will continue to appear as before when looked at from a distance. The mere
disappearance of duality cannot eliminate bondage without realization of
Brahman. At the time of the dissolution of the universe all objects cease to
exist, but they will come into manifestation again when the next cycle of
creation starts. At that time all Jivas who have not realized Brahman in the
previous cycle of creation will be born again. Thus total freedom from rebirth
can be attained only by the realization of Brahman. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The world of objects created by God is a help for the realization of
non-duality and not an obstacle. It does not get destroyed even when a person
attains knowledge of the non-dual Brahman. It is the duality created by the Jiva
that hinders the attainment of Self-knowledge. The duality created by the Jiva
is of two kinds-- that which is in conformity with the scriptural teachings and
that which is not. The first should be accepted and practised till
Self-knowledge is attained. Enquiry about Brahman by hearing the scriptures from
a Guru, reflecting on its teachings and meditating on them is the duality which
is in conformity with the scriptures. This enquiry necessarily involves the
acceptance of different entities such as Guru, disciple and the Sastras, but
this duality is necessary to enable the disciple to conduct the enquiry into
Brahman and so it is acceptable. But even this difference (or duality) has to be
given up after the realization of Brahman, because then there is nothing other
than Brahman. The Amritananda Upanishad says: &quot;A wise person, having
studied the scriptures and repeatedly practised their teachings, should renounce
them after realizing Brahman, just as a traveller throws away a flaming torch
after reaching his destination, or as a person throws away the husk after taking
the grain&quot;. He should thereafter keep his mind fixed on Brahman and should
not burden his mind with mere words (Br. Up. 4.4.21).<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The duality (or multiplicity) that is not in conformity with the
scriptures is that resulting from looking upon all living beings and objects as
different from one another. It is this mental attitude that gives rise to
attachment, aversion, anger, greed and other emotions. The mental attitude that
gives rise to craving, anger and similar emotions is called 'violent'. That
which gives rise to fanciful thoughts is called 'mild'. Both these should be
given up by the spiritual aspirant because calmness of mind and concentration
are the essential pre-requisites for an aspirant. One can become fit for
liberation only if he gives up the desire for objects of sense. The way to do
this is to remember always the adverse consequences of the enjoyment of sense
pleasures. Even mental preoccupation with the objects of desire should be given
up, because it is the seed of all evils. It is said in the Bhagavadgita that
dwelling mentally on objects leads to attachment to them. Attachment gives rise
to longing for the object. If the desire is not fulfilled, anger results. Anger
makes a person forget all the good lessons that he has learnt, and this in turn
results in loss of discrimination. Ultimately he becomes unfit for spiritual
progress. (Gita, 2.62- 63). <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The tendency to think of objects of desire can be overcome by meditating
on Isvara, which will lead to meditation on Nirguna Brahman and to liberation.
When the mind is thus controlled, it becomes calm and free from all
modifications. When one realizes that the phenomenal world has no absolute
reality, one experiences the bliss of Nirvana. Such a person is not merely a
knower of Brahman; he is Brahman itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
