        Br.up. 3.7 the Inner Controller is distinguished from the embodied soul.
        But this distinction is based on the limiting adjunct in the form of the
        body and organs, conjured up by nescience; the distinction is not real.
        The indwelling Self can be only one, not two. The one Self is spoken of
        as two because of the limiting adjuncts, like the space inside a pot
        being looked upon as different from the total space. All the statements
        in the Vedas about the difference between the knower and the known,
        doership and enjoyership, as well as all injunctions and prohibitions
        are based on this standpoint. The text “Because when there is duality,
        as it were, then one sees another, etc “ (Br.up.2.4.14) shows that all
        dealings are only in the state of ignorance, while the text “But when
        to the knower of Brahman everything has become the Self, what (other
        thing) can he see and through what (sense-organ)” denies all such
        activity after the rise of Self-knowledge. <o:p>

        partiality or cruelty can be attributed to God because of the inequality
        found in creation. The difference is due to the merits or demerits of
        individuals, acquired as a result of actions in past births. God is
        comparable to rain. While rain is the common cause of the sprouting of
        all seeds sown, the nature of the sprout depends on the seed. Similarly,
        while God is the common cause of all creation, the nature of a
        particular individual’s life depends on the seed he has sown in the
        form of actions in past births. God cannot therefore be considered
        responsible for the inequalities in the world. Creation is without any
        beginning and so there is no such thing as the first birth of a
        particular individual for which it could be said that there would be no
        cause in the form of past karma. <o:p>

        he is the pure Self, untouched by anything that happens to the body or
        mind. It is further pointed out here that while a reflection of the sun
        in a vessel of water may shake when the water shakes, the sun itself is
        not at all affected, so also God is not affected, though the individual
        soul may be, by what happens to the limiting adjuncts. <o:p>

        and form which constitute the seeds of the entire phenomenal existence
        and which are the products of nescience are non-different from the
        omniscient God and cannot be classified either as real or as unreal.
        They are described in the Vedas and the Smr.tis as the power of God,
        called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">maayaa. </i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>Like space being apparently limited by a pot, etc, God appears
        limited by the limiting adjuncts in the form of name and form, which are
        created by nescience. And within the domain of empirical existence God
        rules over the selves which identify themselves with the individual
        minds and which are, in essence, identical with God. Thus God’s
        rulership, omniscience and omnipotence are based on the limiting
        adjuncts conjured up by nescience; but in reality such terms as
        ‘ruler’, ‘ruled’, ‘omniscience’, etc, are not applicable
        when speaking of the Self, shining in its own pure nature, after the
        cessation of the limiting adjuncts as a result of right knowledge.
        Therefore all the upanishads declare the cessation of all empirical
        dealings in the state of the Highest Reality. It is with reference to
        this unconditioned Brahman that the Lord says in B.G. 5.14 and 15:--
        “Neither agency nor action does the Lord create for the world, nor
        does he bring about the union with the fruit of action. It is nature or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">maayaa
        </i>that does all that. The omnipresent Lord does not take note of the
        merit and demerit of anyone. Knowledge is covered by ignorance and so
        all beings become deluded”. It is seen from this that in the state of
        the Highest Reality all transactions like those between the ruler and
        the ruled, etc, cease to exist. But within the state of phenomenal
        existence, even the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">s’ruti </i>speaks
        of divine rulership, etc, as in Br.up. 4.4.22:-- “He is the Lord of
        all. He is the ruler of all beings. He is the protector of all. He is
        the embankment that serves as the boundary to keep the different worlds
        apart”. (Thus the difference between the standpoints from which the
        unconditioned Brahman, on the one hand, and the conditioned Brahman or
        God, on the other, are spoken of is brought out here).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></font>
