      </span>The ultimate goal of human life is Moksha or liberation from the
      cycle of birth and death. Liberation is nothing but the realization of
      ones real nature. Srimad Bhagavatam defines Moksha succinctly as
      &quot;the establishment of the individual in his essence as the Self freed
      from all wrong identifications&quot; (Bh.II.10.6). Every individual
      identifies himself with the physical body, the sense organs and the mind.
      When a person describes himself as stout or lean or fair-complexioned or
      dark, he is looking upon himself as the physical body to which these
      characteristics belong. When he says 'I see', 'I hear', 'I smell' and so
      on, he is identifying himself with the organs of sense which perform these
      functions. When he says 'I am happy' or 'I am unhappy', he is identifying
      himself with his mind. The Upanishads declare that all these
      identifications are wrong and that the human being is in reality not the
      body or the sense-organs or the mind, but something beyond all these,
      known as the Atman or Self, which is eternal, changeless and not affected
      by anything that happens to the body-mind complex. This wrong
      identification is due to our ignorance of our real nature. This ignorance
      is what is called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">avidya </i>or
      nescience. When this ignorance is eradicated, the person remains
      established in his essence as the Self or Brahman-Atman. The Upanishads
      lay down the means by which this wrong identification can be brought to an
      end and the goal of Moksha attained. <o:p>

      </span>Contrary to popular conception, the objectives of the Upanishads
      and the Puranas are not different, but they are essentially the same,
      namely, to expound the means of attaining liberation. This is made very
      clear in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Skandha12, ch.13, verse18, which says:--<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>

      the flawless Purana, dear to the devotees of Lord Vishnu, extols the One
      Pure Supreme Consciousness, which is the goal of the Paramahamsas. It
      describes Naishkarmya (the state of being firmly established in the
      realization that one is the actionless Brahman-Atman), along with
      spiritual knowledge, detachment and devotion. The man who hears it read or
      reads it himself with devotion and meditates (on its teachings) attains
      liberation&quot;. </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;"><o:p>

      </span>Passages bringing out the gist of the Upanishads are found in
      almost every chapter in this Purana and particularly in the hymns of
      praise (stutis) addressed by various devotees to the Lord. Apart from such
      direct teaching of Vedanta, many of the episodes lend themselves to
      interpretation as allegorical stories which expound Vedanta.
      Srimad-Bhagavatam itself shows the way in this direction through the
      allegorical interpretation given by sage Narada to a story narrated by him
      to king Prachinabarhis (Sk.IV, ch 25 to 29). This Purana can thus be
      studied and appreciated at two different levelsone, as describing the
      glorious deeds of the Lord by which He protects the virtuous and
      establishes Dharma on this earth, and two, as expounding Vedanta through
      allegory. An attempt has been made in the following chapters to give an
      allegorical interpretation of a number of episodes. <o:p>

      are known as the mind-born sons (Manasa-putras) of Brahma, the Creator,
      set out for Vaikuntha to do obeisance to Lord Mahavishnu (III. 15.13). On
      the way they passed through a divine orchard named Naissreyasa which
      was Kaivalya incarnate, as it were, which was resplendent with trees
      that yield all that is desired and are laden with flowers and fruits in
      all seasons (III.15.16):-- <o:p>

      abode of the Lord was surrounded by seven ramparts which had to be crossed
      before one could reach the presence of the Lord. The four sages crossed
      the first six ramparts without any obstruction and without being attracted
      in the least by the beautiful scenery all around, by the delightful
      singing of divine birds, by the fragrance of the divine flowers and by the
      delicious fruits hanging on the trees, their minds fixed on their goal,
      namely, seeing the Lord (III.15. 27).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

      the entrance to the seventh rampart, these sages, who looked like boys of
      five and wore no clothes, were rudely stopped by the two gate-keepers
      named Jaya and Vijaya and were not allowed to proceed further (verse 30).
      Annoyed at being thus stopped, they pronounced a curse that since Jaya and
      Vijaya still entertained the sense of difference and were therefore unfit
      to remain in Vaikuntha, they would be born as Asuras on the earth (verse
      34). That very moment the Lord, who knew what had happened, Himself came
      to the spot where the sages were standing (verse 37). The sages, in
      ecstasy, worshipped the Lord, singing His praises (verse 45). As cursed by
      the sages, Jaya and Vijaya took three successive births as Asuras, first
      as Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakasipu, next as Ravana and Kumbhakarna and
      finally as Sisupala and Dantavaktra and ultimately attained salvation by
      the path of confrontation. <o:p>

      sights, sounds and smells on the way, with total concentration on their

      as soon as the sages pushed Jaya and Vijaya away with a curse, the Lord
      Himself appeared before them, without their having to go further. <o:p>

      </span>The word Naissreyasa means liberation or the total
      cessation of transmigratory existence. It is significant that this is
      the name of the divine orchard through which the sages had to pass. This
      orchard is further described as Kaivalya incarnate, which again
      means liberation. It is therefore quite logical to conclude that,
      allegorically, the journey of the sages to Vaikuntha stands for the
      progress of the spiritual aspirant towards Self-realization. The seven
      ramparts to be crossed represent the five organs of perception, the mind
      and the intellect; crossing these ramparts means achieving complete
      control over the five sense-organs and the mind and ultimately
      transcending the intellect also. This is indicated by saying that the
      sages were not at all distracted from their aim by the delightful things
      on the way. The idea is that, in the same way, the seeker after liberation
      should not allow himself to be attracted by sense-objects, but should
      concentrate his mind on the Self alone. <o:p>

      </span>The obstruction caused by Jaya and Vijaya at the last rampart
      represents the last traces of raga (attachment) and dvesha (aversion)
      which, as the Bhagavad-gita says, are the enemies of the spiritual
      aspirant. The Gita compares them to two highway robbers who will rob us of
      our spiritual wealth and warns us to be careful not to fall into their
      clutches (Gita 3.34).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">Just
      as the sages pushed away Jaya and Vijaya from their path, the aspirant
      should push out even the last traces of attachment and aversion from his
      mind and make his mind pure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
      is significant that as soon as the sages pushed away Jaya and Vijaya by a
      curse, the Lord appeared before them. This indicates that, once the
      aspirant has become completely free from attachment and aversion,
      Self-realization will dawn immediately. <o:p>

      </font> </span><font size="4">Thus,
      through this episode, the path to Self-realization is brought out, step by
      step. Control the senses and the mind, concentrate the mind on the Self,
      do not be attracted by worldly pleasures and root out attachment and
      aversion. This is the path to Self-realization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span>The Kathopanishad says (2.1.1) that the nature of the sense-organs
      is to proceed outward, to enjoy sense-objects, such as sound, etc.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:

      are therefore not capable of knowing the indwelling Self. But a rare Dhira,
      desiring immortality, withdraws his sense-organs from external objects and
      sees the indwelling Self. Kalidasa defines Dhira as one whose mind
      is not distracted even in the presence of the most desirable objects
      (Kumarasambhava,I.59).</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;

      </span>Svayambhuva Manu, the first of the fourteen Manus, was engaged in
      the task of creation at the command of his father, Brahma. He suddenly
      noticed that the earth, the dwelling place for all creatures, had been
      submerged in the waters. Manu approached Brahma and prayed to him to lift
      the earth out of the waters. Knowing that he was helpless and that only
      the Supreme Lord, Narayana, could come to his help, Brahma meditated on
      the Lord. While he was thus meditating, a tiny boar cub of the size of a
      thumb emerged from his nostril. The boar immediately grew to the size of
      an elephant and then to the size of a mountain, all in a trice. Brahma was
      very much amazed and guessed that the boar could be none other than
      Narayana Himself. The sages in the jana, tapa and satya lokas began to
      sing hymns extolling the Lord. The Lord in the form of the huge boar
      suddenly plunged into the waters. Lifting up with His tusk the earth that
      had been submerged in the waters by the Asura Hiranyaksha, the Lord placed
      the earth on the surface of the water. He then turned towards the Asura
      who was rushing towards Him in uncontrollable anger. A fierce fight
      ensued, during which the Asura employed many magical tricks, all of which
      proved to be of no avail against the Lord, who is Himself the wielder of
      Maya. The Lord despatched His beloved weapon, the Discus, known as
      Sudarsana and destroyed the phantoms conjured up by the Asura with his
      magical powers. The Lord then dealt the Asura a severe blow, without any
      effort, as if it was mere play. The Asura dropped dead. The earth was thus

      </font>
      </span><font size="4">Now let us try to find out the allegorical meaning of this story.
      The earth is proverbially considered to be synonymous with forbearance. In
      the Valmiki Ramayana, Sri Rama is described by sage Narada as 'equal to
      the earth in forbearance' (kshamayaa prithiveesamah- Bala Kanda, Ch.1,
      verse18). Forbearance is one of the hallmarks of Sattvaguna. The earth
      therefore stands for Sattvaguna in this episode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font>
      </span><font size="4">The Lord says in the Bhagavadgita that everything in this universe
      is made up of the three gunas-- Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Sattva stands for
      knowledge, calmness, serenity and similar virtues. Rajas stands for ego-centred
      activity and Tamas for sleep, indolence and similar qualities. In the
      majority of human beings Rajas predominates, making their minds ever go
      outward in search of happiness. Spiritual evolution requires the
      withdrawal of the mind from external objects and directing it towards the
      Self (Atma) within, which is Bliss itself and therefore the source of all
      happiness. This can be achieved only by reducing the Rajoguna in the mind
      and increasing the Sattvaguna correspondingly. Karmayoga and devotional
      practices help to achieve this. It is said by the Lord in the Bhagavadgita
      that Sattva increases when Rajas and Tamas are subdued. (Ch.14, verse10).
      This process of conquering our Rajasic tendencies and bringing up the
      Sattvaguna which is lying suppressed within is what is allegorically
      brought out by this story. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </font>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </font>
      </span><font size="4">Hiranyaksha, being an Asura possessing all the Asuric qualities
      spoken of in Chapter 16 of the Gita, represents Rajoguna. When Rajoguna
      predominates, Sattvaguna is suppressed. This suppression of Sattvaguna,
      represented here by the earth, by Rajoguna, represented by Hiranyaksha is
      the significance of Hiranyaksha keeping the earth immersed in water.
      Brahma sought the help of the Lord to save the earth from the Asura. So
      also, we have to pray for divine help to conquer our Rajoguna and bring up
      the suppressed Sattvaguna. When Brahma meditated on the Lord, the boar
      came out of his nostril, that is to say, the power which crushed the Asura
      came from within himself. This is very significant. This indicates that
      when we resort to meditation on the Lord, the strength to conquer our
      Rajoguna will come from within ourselves and not from outside. This
      strength, which, like the boar, is small initially, grows with our
      devotion and meditation, as the boar did. Ultimately we acquire sufficient
      spiritual strength within ourselves to conquer our Rajasic tendencies and
      make our mind predominantly Sattvic. This is symbolized by the slaying of
      Hiranyaksha and the rescue of the earth. <o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Thus the import of this story, if looked at allegorically, is that
      by devotion to God and meditation the seeker can generate within himself
      the power to get rid of the Rajasic (and Tamasic) tendencies which stand
      in the way of spiritual evolution and make his mind predominantly Sattvic.
      Such a mind alone can be completely withdrawn from external objects and
      concentrated on the Self. This is the way to Self-realization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>There was a Pandya king by name Indradyumna who was a great devotee
      of the Lord. Towards the end of his life he had retired to a hermitage in
      a forest and used to spend all his time in worship of the Lord. One day he
      was performing worship as usual and observing a vow of silence. Sage
      Agastya then happened to come there along with his disciples. Being
      engrossed in worship, the King did not notice
      the presence of the sage and so failed to offer him the customary honours.
      The sage took offence at this apparent indifference and pronounced the
      following curse--&quot;This king has insulted me. Let him therefore be
      steeped in blinding ignorance. Since he is haughty like an elephant, let
      him be born as an elephant&quot;. Before proceeding further with the story
      it would be worthwhile to examine what is the underlying idea behind such
      curses by great sages who are expected to have conquered anger and to
      remain unaffected by either praise or insult. Such curses are really
      blessings. In the present instance, though the king was a sincere devotee
      of the Lord, he had not yet realized the truth that the same God or Self
      dwells in all beings. Liberation is possible only with such a realization.
      In the normal course he would<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>probably
      have to go through many more births before attaining this state. The curse
      inflicted on him and the consequent suffering he undergoes as an elephant
      make him surrender totally to the Lord and become liberated immediately.
      Thus the curse was intended to hasten his liberation and was really a
      blessing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>One point which puzzles us here is-- why does the sage curse the
      king whose failure to recognize him is due only to his being absorbed in
      the highly laudable object of worship of the Lord? There is a parallel to
      this in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the Ramayanamahatmya
      in the Skanda Purana. There was a very righteous person named Somadatta
      who was a disciple of the sage Gautama. One day, when Somadatta was
      engaged in the worship of Lord Siva, sage Gautama happened to come there.
      Somadatta did not notice his presence. The sage did not however find fault
      with him, considering that he was absorbed in worship, and went away. But
      Lord Siva became angry at this insult to the Guru and cursed that he would
      become a Rakshasa. On Somatta's pleading for forgiveness the Lord said
      that he would be relieved of the effect of the curse if he heard the
      entire Ramayana with devotion over a period of nine days. The main object
      of this episode is to bring out the greatness of Ramayana, but
      incidentally it also points out that even inadvertent indifference to the
      Guru is a transgression. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>As a result of the curse, king Indradyumna was born as a lordly
      elephant. The elephant used to roam about in the forest accompanied by a
      herd of female elephants. One day he entered a lake to bathe and drink
      water. Suddenly a very strong crocodile seized him by the leg and tried to
      drag him into the water. The elephant tried his best to extricate himself
      from the hold of the crocodile, but all his efforts proved to be in vain.
      The female elephants tried to pull him out, but finding that the crocodile
      was too strong and that their efforts would only result in themselves also
      being dragged into the water, they left him to his fate and went away. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>After a long struggle the elephant realized that he could not save
      himself from the jaws of the crocodile by his own efforts. The suffering
      which he underwent brought back to him the memory of the devotion he had
      practised and the knowledge<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>he
      had acquired in his previous birth as King Indradyumna. He then
      surrendered himself totally to the Lord, chanting hymns of praise
      addressed to the supreme unconditioned Brahman. Since the hymns were
      addressed to the supreme formless Brahman, Brahma and the other gods did
      not go to his help, because they egoistically identified themselves with
      their own forms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The supreme
      Lord, who is the soul of the whole universe, appeared immediately and
      rescued him by severing the jaw of the crocodile with his discus. The
      crocodile was none other than a Gandharva by name Hoohoo, who was now
      freed from the curse of sage Devala and regained his original marvellous
      form. <o:p>

      </span></p>

      </span>The story ends thus-- &quot;Freed for ever from the bondage of
      ignorance through the touch of the Lord, the leader of the elephants
      attained a form similar to the Lord's; he was clad in yellow silks and
      endowed with four arms (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saroopya</i>)&quot;-
      (Bh. VIII.4.6.)</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

      at this episode allegorically, it can be said that the elephant stands for
      the 'ego' which is the result of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
      bondage of ignorance. This ignorance and its result, the ego, disappear by
      the grace of the Lord and the individual realizes his identity with the
      supreme Self, here described as attaining the same form as the Lord. The
      crocodile represents this transmigratory existence, or samsaara, which is
      often compared to a crocodile in Vedantic texts such as Vivekachudamani.
      The individual, because of his ego, i.e. identification with his body due
      to ignorance of his real nature, is caught in the jaws of the crocodile,
      the samsaara. He can get release from this only by the Lord's grace.
      Neither his own efforts nor the help of others will save him from his
      false identification. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The elephant's prayer is addressed to the Nirguna Brahman and
      contains the quintessence of all the Upanishads. What is the idea in
      putting all this wisdom in the mouth of an animal? The object is to bring
      out an important teaching of the Upanishads and the Gita. The elephant
      was, in his previous life as King Indradyumna, a great devotee and had
      mastered the Upanishads. The knowledge acquired in that life came back to
      him in his next life as an elephant, at the proper time. The Bhagavadgita
      says in verse 43 of chapter 6 that the knowledge acquired in the previous
      body continues in the next birth and enables the person to evolve further.
      In the Brihadaranyaka upanishad it is said that at<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>the time of death the departing self carries with it the knowledge
      acquired, the fruits of actions performed (karma) and past experience
      (IV.iv.2). </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;"><o:p>

      </span>The crocodile which caught the elephant was in its previous life a
      Gandharva by name Hoohoo. This Gandharva used to indulge in various
      pranks. Once, when the sage Devala was bathing in a river, Hoohoo went
      under the water and caught the sage by the leg. Since this behaviour was
      characteristic of a crocodile, the sage cursed him to be born as a
      crocodile. This story brings out the principle enunciated in the
      Upanishads that a person's next life will be determined by his actions and
      thoughts in this life. The Kathopanishad says- (II.ii.7) - </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;"><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">&quot;Some
      souls enter wombs for acquiring bodies and others are born as motionless
      beings in accordance with their actions and in conformity with their
      knowledge&quot;-- i.e. the next birth will be as a human being or an
      animal or as a plant or tree, depending on his actions and thoughts in
      this life. The Gandharva Hoohoo was born as a crocodile because his action
      in catching hold of the feet of sage Devala was characteristic of a
      crocodile. Thus several teachings of the Upanishads are conveyed through
      this story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span>The episode of the churning of the Ocean of Milk for getting the
      Nectar of immortality appears in chapters 5 to 11 of the eighth Skandha of
      Srimad Bhagavata. The story may first be narrated before going into its

      </span>Sage Durvasa had received a divine garland from a celestial damsel.
      Knowing that the wearer of this garland would be blessed with all
      prosperity, Durvasa went to Indra and presented the garland to him. Indra,
      who was then seated on his elephant, received it without caring to get
      down and make obeisance to the sage, and nonchalantly placed it on the
      head of the elephant. The elephant shook its head and, when the garland
      fell down, trampled on it. Sorely annoyed at this blatant display of
      disrespect, Durvasa left immediately after pronouncing a curse that Indra,
      as well as the three worlds ruled by him, would soon lose all their
      splendour. Taking advantage of the situation the Asuras attacked the Devas
      and killed many of them. Indra and the other gods rushed to Brahma seeking
      his help. Brahma told them that none but Lord Vishnu would be able to help
      them out of their predicament. Lord Vishnu, to whom all of them then went,
      advised them to make peace with the Asuras and seek their co-operation for
      churning the Ocean of Milk to get the nectar which would make them
      immortal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span>As commanded by Lord Vishnu, the gods got the co-operation of the
      Asuras and set about the task of churning the ocean, using the Mandara
      mountain as the churning rod and the serpent Vasuki as the churning rope.
      While the gods and the Asuras were carrying the mountain to the ocean they
      became exhausted by the great effort and dropped the mountain. The Lord
      immediately appeared there on his mount Garuda, placed the mountain on
      Garuda and carried it to the ocean with ease. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>When the churning was to begin, the Lord asked the Asuras to hold
      the tail-end of Vasuki and the Devas the head. The Asuras objected to this
      and wanted to be at the head-end. The Lord immediately agreed to this.
      This was a stratagem adopted by the Lord to make the Asuras suffer when
      poison would emanate from Vasuki's mouth during the churning. When the
      churning had gone on for a little while, the mountain sank into the ocean
      because of its weight. The Lord again came to their rescue by taking the
      form of a huge tortoise, going deep down into the ocean and lifting up the
      mountain on His back. The Devas and Asuras then resumed the churning while
      the Lord Himself kept the mountain in position by pressing it down with
      one hand so as to prevent it from springing up due to the force of the
      churning. When Vasuki began to emit poison, the Asuras who were at the
      head-end were affected most and the Devas at the tail-end to a lesser
      extent. The Lord then caused cool showers of rain to fall on the Devas,
      but not on the Asuras.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span>When nothing emerged from the ocean in spite of long churning, the
      Lord Himself took up the churning, holding both ends of Vasuki in His
      hands. The first thing to emerge after the Lord took up the churning was
      the deadly poison known as Haalaahala. As it spread in all directions, the
      terrified Devas ran to Lord Siva for refuge. Lord Siva took the poison in
      the hollow of His palm and put it in His mouth, but did not swallow it,
      lest the living beings inside His stomach be destroyed. He kept it in His
      throat and thereby protected all the living beings, both within and
      outside Him. The poison left a black mark around His throat and that
      became His special adornment. <o:p>

      </span>Then there emerged from the ocean, one after another, Kamadhenu,
      whom Lord Vishnu gave to the Rishis, the horse Uchchhaisravas, the
      elephant Airavata,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
      Kalpaka tree which grants all wishes, and divine damsels, all of whom were
      given to the Devas by the Lord. Then Goddess Lakshmi emerged and she chose
      the Lord Himself as her consort. The next to come up was the intoxicating
      liquor Varuni, which the Lord permitted the Asuras to take for themselves.
      Finally emerged Dhanvantari, another form of the Lord Himself, holding in
      his hands a vessel of nectar. The Asuras immediately snatched the nectar,
      while the Devas looked on helplessly. The Lord again came to the rescue of
      the Devas, taking the form of a beautiful young damsel, Mohini. The Asuras,
      who were intoxicated with the liquor Varuni, became infatuated with Mohini
      and requested her to distribute the nectar. Mohini asked the Devas and the
      Asuras to sit in separate rows and distributed all the nectar to the Devas,
      while the Asuras, who had succumbed to her charms, merely looked on. One
      Asura, Rahu, had disguised himself as a Deva and sat between the Sun and
      the Moon and he was also served nectar, but, on being pointed out by a
      gesture by the Sun and the Moon, the Lord cut him into two with his
      Discus. His trunk, which had not been touched by the nectar, fell down,
      but the head having gained immortality because of the contact of nectar,
      Brahma turned him into a planet. It is that planet which, entertaining
      animosity against them, swallows the Sun and the Moon, causing the
      eclipses.<o:p>

      </span>When the Asuras realised that they had been fooled by Mohini, they
      attacked the Devas, but with the help of the Lord the Devas were able to
      vanquish them. <o:p>

      </span>Now let us see what are the lessons conveyed by this story. The
      Devas and Asuras can be taken as representing the divine and demoniac
      tendencies in the human mind, which are described in chapter 16 of the
      Bhagavadgita. This is supported by the explanation given by Sri Sankara in
      his Bhashya on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
      Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, 1.iii.1. Sri Sankara says, &quot;The Devas and
      the Asuras are the organs of speech and the rest. They become Devas when
      they shine under the influence of thoughts and actions as taught by the
      scriptures. Those very organs become Asuras when they are under the
      influence of their natural thoughts and actions, based only on perception
      and inference, and directed merely towards the attainment of worldly
      ends&quot;. The divine tendencies are fearlessness, purity of mind,
      control of the senses, straightforwardness, non-covetousness, humility,
      and the like. The demoniac tendencies are arrogance, anger, harshness,
      ignorance and the like. Both these types of tendencies are present in
      every normal human being. The proportion of divine and demoniac tendencies
      varies from person to person. Even in the same person sometimes the divine
      tendencies may be dominant and sometimes the demoniac, making the person
      behave differently at different times. Indra here represents such a human
      mind. When sage Durvasa came, the demoniac tendencies were dominant in
      Indra and so he behaved arrogantly. His discrimination was clouded. The
      curse of Durvasa shows that no one, however high the position he occupies,
      can escape the consequences of actions performed under the influence of
      demoniac tendencies. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>As soon as the sage uttered the curse, Indra realised the
      consequences and sought the grace of the Lord which alone can help man.
      The Lord asked him to make peace with the Asuras temporarily because they
      were at that time very strong and could not be defeated. This is another
      way of saying that it is not possible to get rid of the demoniac
      tendencies by fighting against them and trying to suppress them when they
      are strong. The divine tendencies must first be made stronger and then
      only can the demoniac tendencies be countered. The Devas were therefore
      asked to strengthen themselves by getting the nectar from the ocean. <o:p>

font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The figure of 'churning' is one which appears in the Upanishads
      also. It stands for the extraction of the essence. The
      Svetasvataropanishad says (1.14):--<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>

      one's own body the lower piece of wood and the pranava the upper piece of
      wood, and practising churning in the form of meditation, one should
      realise God as one would find out something hidden&quot;. (For lighting
      the fire for yajnas one piece of wood is placed vertically on another
      piece of wood placed horizontally and churning is done to produce fire.
      The two pieces of wood are known as Aranis). The same upanishad also says
      that the supreme Self can be perceived in the intellect, just as butter
      can be obtained from curd (1.16).</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;"><o:p>

      just as butter is obtained by churning curd, one can realise the Self by
      churning one's own intellect. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>In Sivanandalahari, verse 37, Sri Sankara says that the wise man
      should churn the ocean of the Vedas, using his virtuous mind as the rod
      and firm devotion as the rope, in order to realise God:--<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">&quot;Just
      as the Devas churned the ocean of milk and obtained the moon, the
      wish-fulfilling tree, the cow Kamadhenu, the gem Chintamani, nectar and
      Goddess Lakshmi, so the wise churn the ocean of the Vedas, using their
      virtuous mind as the rod and firm devotion as the rope and attain you
      (Lord Siva), who confer the nectar of eternal bliss&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">This
      is the significance of this episode of churning the ocean of milk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>It has been repeatedly brought out in this episode that no one can
      succeed in any action without the grace and help of the Lord. When the
      Devas and the Asuras were carrying the Mandara mountain it fell down and
      only the Lord could take it to the ocean. When the mountain went down into
      the water, the Lord had to take the form of a huge tortoise and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>lift
      it up. It was only after the Lord Himself took up the churning that things
      began to emerge from the ocean. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The first thing to emerge from the ocean was the deadly poison,
      which was removed by Lord Siva so that it may not do any harm to living
      beings. The idea brought out here is that when a person progresses
      sufficiently in meditation, all the impurities in his mind such as desire,
      anger, greed, and the like, which harm his spiritual progress, are removed
      by the grace of God. The poison may be taken as standing for such
      impurities.<o:p>

      </span>While asking the Devas to churn the ocean for nectar, Lord Vishnu
      warned them not to covet any of the things that might come up during the
      churning (Bh.VIII.6.25).</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;">
      </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">This is similar to the warning given
      to the spiritual aspirant not to be tempted by the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">siddhis</i>
      which may come to him, but to keep his mind fixed on the ultimate goal,
      liberation. The Kamadhenu, kalpaka tree, etc, represent the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">siddhis</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      </span>The Devas and the Asuras jointly churned the Milk Ocean for amrita
      (the nectar that confers freedom from death). When the Lord emerged from
      the ocean in the form of Dhanvantari carrying a pot containing amrita, the
      Asuras snatched the pot. The Lord then appeared in the form of Mohini and
      distributed all the amrita to the Devas. The Asuras who were deprived of
      the nectar began to fight against the Devas. In the fight Bali, one of the
      Asuras, was killed by Indra, the king of the Devas. Bali was later brought
      back to life by Sukracharya, the Guru of the Asuras. Under the guidance of
      Sukracharya Bali performed a Visvajit sacrifice and acquired extraordinary
      powers. He then attacked the capital of Indra in heaven. Brihaspati, the
      Guru of the Devas, told Indra that Bali was very strong at that time and
      that it would be futile for the Devas to resist his attack. He advised the
      Devas to go into hiding and bide their time for a counter-attack.
      Accordingly the Devas left heaven and Bali occupied it as the ruler of all
      the three worlds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      </span></p>

      </span>Sorely grieved at the plight of her sons, Aditi, the mother of the
      Devas, requested her husband, the great sage Kasyapa, to devise some means
      by which the Devas could get back their kingdom and their previous glory.
      The sage advised her to worship Lord Vishnu by observing a vow known as 'payovrata'.
      This consists of worship for a period of twelve days during the bright
      fortnight of the month of phalguna, observing strictly certain disciplines
      and living on milk alone. Aditi observed the vow, following all the
      instructions strictly. At the conclusion of the vow the Lord appeared
      before her and told her that He would soon be born as her son. He asked
      her to keep the fact of His having appeared before her a total secret. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The Lord was then born as Aditi's son on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sravana
      Dvadasi, </i>the twelfth day of the bright fortnight of the month of
      Bhadrapada. This day is celebrated even now as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Vijaya
      Dvadasi.</i> At birth the child was in the resplendent form of Vishnu,
      clad in yellow silks, with four arms bearing<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
      </i>the conch, the mace, the lotus and the discus, but he changed
      immediately into the form of a dwarfish human child.<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
      </i>The delighted sages present, including Kasyapa, conducted the
      appropriate sacraments and invested him with the sacred thread. The sacred
      Gayatri mantra was imparted by the sun-god, Savita himself. Brihaspati
      gave him the sacred thread and Kasyapa the grass girdle. Goddess Earth
      gave him the skin of the black antelope, the moon-god gave him his staff;
      his mother gave him a cod-piece and a loin-cloth, while the goddess of the
      sky gave an umbrella. Brahma gave him a water pot and the seven sages <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">kusa
      </i>grass, while Goddess Sarasvati gave him a garland of beads. The
      sovereign of the Yakshas gave him the begging bowl, and Goddess Uma
      Herself, the Mother of the universe, gave him his first alms. Thus
      honoured, Vamana outshone by his Brahmic splendour every one in that
      assembly of Brahmarshis. Then, hearing that Bali was performing horse
      sacrifices, Vamana set out for the Yagasala. Dazzled by the splendour of
      Vamana even when he was at a distance, Bali and the priests who were
      conducting the sacrifices wondered whether it was the sun-god himself, or
      god Agni or the sage Sanatkumara who was coming towards them. They
      received Vamana with great respect. Bali washed Vamana's feet and
      sprinkled the water purified by the touch of those feet on his own head.
      He then asked Vamana what gift he wanted, saying in all arrogance that he
      could give anything Vamana wanted-- food, house, land or a bride or
      anything else, or all of them. Vamana replied that all that he wanted was
      just a small strip of land, three paces in length as measured by his own
      feet. On hearing this Bali laughed and said, &quot;O boy! You are a
      simpleton. Having approached me, the undisputed ruler of all the three
      worlds, and so capable of gifting a whole continent, you are asking for
      such a petty gift. My generosity is such that any one who has obtained a
      favour from me will not thereafter find it necessary to go to any one else
      for anything&quot;. Vamana replied that he would be contented with just
      what he had asked for, because a person who is not contented with three
      paces of land would not be satisfied even if he gets an entire continent.
      Bali then said, &quot;Let it be as you wish&quot;, and was about to give
      the gift asked for. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Bali's Guru Sukracharya then recognised Vamana as Lord Vishnu
      Himself and asked Bali not to give the gift, because the intention of
      Vamana was to take away everything belonging to Bali and give it to Indra.
      Bali told Sukracharya, &quot;Having made a promise, I will not go back on
      it, whatever may be the consequences. I am not afraid so much of the
      tortures of hell, poverty, loss of position or even death as I am of
      breaking my pledged word. If indeed Lord Vishnu Himself has come to beg of
      me, there can be no greater blessing for me. I will therefore honour my
      word and give the gift&quot;. Annoyed that Bali did not heed his advice,
      Sukracharya cursed him, saying, &quot;You have grown so arrogant as to
      reject my advice. A highly conceited fool that you are, you will soon fall
      from you high position&quot;. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Undaunted by the curse, Bali insisted on honouring his word and
      proceeded to give the gift of three paces of land to Vamana. Vamana
      immediately grew in size to such an extent that with the first stride he
      covered the earth, the sky and the four quarters. With his second stride
      he covered heaven and all the worlds up to Satyaloka, the world of Brahma.
      He then asked Bali to show him the place for his third stride. Without
      flinching in the least, Bali said. &quot;Pray place your third step on my
      head&quot;. The Lord did so and sent Bali to one of the nether regions
      named Sutala, as the ruler thereof, promising that He Himself would
      permanently stand guard there. The Lord further said that Bali would
      become Indra in the next Manvantara and would thereafter go to the Lord's
      own realm, Vaikuntha. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>We see from this story that Bali possessed many great virtues. He
      had great respect for holy men, which is evident from the way he received
      and honoured the Brahmachari boy, Vamana (whom he did not know to be Lord
      Vishnu). He was extremely generous. Above all, he kept his word and
      refused to go back on it even after his Guru pronounced a terrible curse
      on him. Why was such a person punished by the Lord? This is the question
      that comes up in everyone's mind. This very question was put by Brahma to
      Lord Vishnu. Brahma asked, &quot;This Asura gifted away the entire earth
      and all the other worlds he had won by good works to Thee; and even his<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>body has been offered without the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>slightest hesitation. A man who is free from guile obtains the
      highest of goals by merely offering <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">arghya</i> at Thy feet and worshipping them with just a blade of grass.
      That being so, how can he who gave away the three worlds with a serene
      mind be subjected to such a punishment?&quot; (Bh.VIII. 22.23):-- </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p>

      Brahma! I take away the wealth of those on whom I shower My grace. For, it
      is because of being intoxicated with wealth that a person becomes arrogant
      and despises the whole world and even Me&quot; (Bh.VIII.22.24). He further
      adds, &quot;If, in spite of high birth, great deeds, youth, beauty,
      learning, power, affluence and the like, a person remains free from pride,
      it is due only to My grace&quot; (Bh.VIII.22.26).</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;

      </span>Thus the great defect in Bali's character was the arrogance of
      wealth and power. This overshadowed all his innumerable virtues. The
      lesson we learn from this episode is that as long as there is arrogance
      spiritual progress is not possible, even though the person may possess
      many virtues. When the Lord says that he takes away the wealth of the
      person he wishes to bless, what is meant is that the conceit that one is
      affluent and powerful, which is the cause of arrogance, is removed by the
      Lord, so that spiritual progress becomes possible. By surrendering all his
      possessions to the Lord Bali became free from the notion of 'mine-ness' (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mamakara).
      </i>Then, by asking the Lord to place His feet on his own head, he gave up
      his ego or 'I-ness' (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ahamkara).</i>
      With these two removed, he became fit for the Lord's grace. Thus an
      attitude of detachment towards all possessions and total surrender to the
      Lord are the virtues to be cultivated by every spiritual aspirant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      </span>In fact, the Lord has not punished Bali, but has really blessed
      him, as may be seen from the following words of the Lord
      Himself:--&quot;You have been granted by Me a place unattainable even by
      the gods. In the Meru-Savarni Manvantara you will be the Indra with my
      full support. Till then you will live in Sutala; those who live there
      shall be vouchsafed My gracious glance and will ever be unaffected by
      physical and mental ailments. You will always have My presence there.
      Constantly witnessing My greatness there, you will become absolutely free
      from even the slightest trace of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">asuric</i>

      </span>The Bhagavata Purana describes how Kamsa sent many Asuras to kill
      Krishna and how all of them were slain effortlessly by Krishna. One of the
      Asuras who met with such a fate was Pralamba. The story is narrated in
      chapter 18 of the tenth skandha. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>One day, as usual, Krishna, Balarama and the cowherd boys took
      their calves to Brindavana for grazing. There they entertained themselves
      by playing a game in which the boys were divided into two teams, one under
      the leadership of Krishna and the other under that of Balarama. A boy
      belonging to one team would wrestle with a boy from the other team. The
      boy who was defeated had to carry on his shoulders the boy who won up to
      the foot of a particular banyan tree. Krishna allowed himself to be
      defeated by his dearest friend Sudama and then carried Sudama up to the
      tree. This action of the Lord is interpreted as indicating that He is the
      servant of His devotees. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>An Asura named Pralamba, an emissary of Kamsa, came there in the
      guise of a cowherd boy, with the intention of killing Krishna and Balarama.
      He requested Krishna to allow him to take part in the game. Though Krishna
      knew who he was, he pretended ignorance and took Pralamba in his own team.
      Pralamba wrestled with Balarama and was defeated. He then carried Balarama
      on his shoulders as required by the rules of the game, but did not stop at
      the foot of the banyan tree to allow Balarama to get down. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>When Balarama found that he was being carried far away he became
      suspicious and increased his weight in order to force Pralamba to put him
      down. Pralamba then assumed his real form as an Asura. Seeing the huge
      form of the Asura and finding that the Asura was carrying him far away
      from Krishna, Balarama became frightened. He then turned round and because
      of the great height of the Asura he was able to see the face of Krishna at
      a distance. It is said in the Vishnupurana (5.9.23) that Krishna then
      mentally transmitted the following message to Balarama:-- &quot;O you who
      are the self of all! Why have you, who are the most mysterious indwelling
      self, assumed the attitude of an ordinary human being (and become
      frightened)?&quot;. </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;

      receiving this message and looking at the face of Krishna, all fear
      disappeared from Balarama's mind and he got the courage and strength to
      crush the Asura and extricate himself. <o:p>
      </o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>In this story Pralamba represents the evil vasanas (inherent
      tendencies acquired in past lives) in every human being. These vasanas
      make the human being<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>engage
      himself in various worldly activities and carry him away from the Lord as
      Balarama was carried away from Krishna by Pralamba. </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;"><o:p>

      </span>The message which Krishna gave to Balarama is applicable not only
      to Balarama but to every human being. The meaning of the message is--
      &quot;You are really the Atman, but you are wrongly identifying yourself
      with your body-mind complex and looking upon yourself as a limited being.
      It is this wrong identification that makes you a slave to your vasanas and
      results in your being carried away hither and thither by them. Once you
      realise your real identity, namely that you are the indwelling self which
      is none other than the supreme Brahman itself, you will be able to
      extricate yourself from the hold of your vasanas&quot;. The destruction of
      Pralamba signifies the elimination of vasanas, which is the same as
      liberation. Sri Sankara says in Vivekachudamani that the elimination of
      vasanas is itself liberation and it is what is called 'jivanmukti' (verse
      318). Sri Narayana Bhattatiri says in his Narayaneeyam (which is a
      condensed version of Srimad Bhagavatam) that when Balarama came back to
      Krishna after killing Pralamba, Krishna embraced Balarama and the gods
      showered flowers on both of them (Dasaka 57, verse 10). Krishna's embrace
      represents union with the Lord or the realisation of the identity of the
      individual self and Brahman. Even the gods worship such a human being
      because by re<a name="_Hlt45444014"></a>alising his real identity as
      Brahman he has become the self of the gods too. <o:p>

      </span>In chapter 19 of the tenth Skandha of
      Srimad Bhagavatam is described how Lord Krishna rescued a group of cowherd
      boys and their cows from a raging forest fire. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>One day, as usual, Krishna and Balarama, along with a large number
      of cowherd boys, led their cows to the forest for grazing. While the boys
      were engrossed in play, the cows went forward in search of tender grass.
      As they moved on, they advanced beyond the limits of Vrindavana which was
      the abode of Krishna and entered a forest called 'Aishikam'. This forest
      was full of a particular variety of grass which had the tendency to catch
      fire easily. The forest was unbearably hot and the cows became totally
      exhausted because of hunger and thirst. The tender grass which they hoped
      to find was nowhere to be seen. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The cowherd boys, who were absorbed in play, did not notice for a
      long time that the cows had gone far away from them. When they did not
      find the cows at the place where they had left them, they became worried
      and went in search of them and found them in the Aishika forest. When they
      were about to bring the cows back, a forest fire broke out. The boys found
      themselves and their cows surrounded by the fire. In desperation they
      cried out to Krishna for help. Krishna came and asked them not to be
      afraid but to close their eyes for a few moments. They did so, and when
      they opened their eyes again they found themselves back in Vrindavana with
      no trace whatsoever of the fire. They were thus saved by Krishna from the
      fire. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The story looks very simple, but every statement in it has profound
      philosophical significance. The cows, which moved away from Krishna in
      search of tender grass represent human beings who forget the Lord and seek
      happiness in the world outside. As happened to the cows, the search for
      happiness in the world proves futile and results only in disappointment
      and suffering. The heat of the Aishika forest and the forest fire
      represent the sufferings of man in this transmigratory existence. Krishna
      asked the boys and the cows to close their eyes for a while and
      immediately all their sufferings vanished. 'Closing the eyes' stands for
      withdrawal of all the organs of sense from their objects. A very similar
      expression is used in the Kathopanishad, II.i.1 which says:--<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;ITR Dev Shridhar&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">&quot;The
      Lord made the senses outgoing. Therefore one can see only external objects
      and not the inner Self. A rare discriminating individual, desiring
      immortality, turns his eyes away and then sees the indwelling Self&quot;.
      In this mantra the term 'eyes' stands for all the organs of sense. The
      meaning of this mantra is: Our sense-organs have been endowed by God with
      the power to experience only sense-objects in the external world. They are
      not capable of knowing the indwelling Self. A rare person, who has
      acquired total purity of mind, withdraws all his sense-organs from their
      objects and concentrates his mind on the Self. He then realises the self
      and becomes free from all the sufferings of this world. The boys and the
      cows found that the fire which was tormenting them had disappeared without
      a trace when they closed their eyes for a moment. This episode thus brings
      out allegorically the meaning of the mantra of the Kathopanishad quoted
      above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

      subsequently restored to a form even more resplendent than his original
      one by the touch of Sri Krishna's foot. This story has a wealth of
      Vedantic implications. <o:p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>On a certain day the cowherds of Gokula went, along with Krishna,
      to a place known as 'Ambikavanam'. Having bathed in the river Saraswati
      there, they worshipped Lord Siva and His consort Goddess Ambika. They
      spent that night on the bank of the river, in prayer and fasting. Suddenly
      a huge python appeared and began to devour Nandagopa. Hearing Nandagopa's
      cries the cowherds rushed to his rescue and belaboured the python with
      firebrands. In spite of severe beating the python did not release
      Nandagopa from its hold. Krishna then went there and touched the python
      with his foot. At once the python disappeared and there stood in its place
      a most resplendent Vidyadhara. When asked by Krishna who he was, he said,
      &quot;I am a Vidyadhara named Sudarsana. I was endowed with great wealth
      and beauty<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and used to fly in
      my aerial car all over the world. Being very proud of my exceptional
      beauty, I was very haughty. One day I ridiculed some sages of the Angirasa
      family for their ugly looks. For this sin those sages made me take this
      birth. The curse that those compassionate souls pronounced on me has
      become a blessing to me; because of it I have been blessed with the touch
      of the foot of the Lord of the universe, and have been cleansed of my
      sin&quot;. So saying, he prostrated before Krishna and ascended to heaven.

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>What are the lessons that this story has for us? In the first
      place, what are called curses in the Puranas are really blessings when
      they come from great sages who are full of compassion and do not even wish
      ill of anyone, let alone inflicting punishment. They are beyond praise and
      ridicule and are not in the least influenced or affected by them. Whatever
      they do is always for the good of others. If we analyse the curses
      appearing in the Puranas, we will find that they fall into two broad
      categories-- 1) those which, though outwardly appearing to be curses,
      really bless the person concerned by placing him in circumstances in which
      he is able to free himself of the defects in his character which stand as
      obstacles in the way of his spiritual advancement; (this can be compared
      to the action of a surgeon who uses his scalpel on the patient with the
      noble intention of curing him of an ailment which prevents him from
      leading a normal happy life) and 2) those which merely emphasize the fact
      that the next birth of a person will be in accordance with his thoughts
      and actions in this birth. Examples of the first category are the curses
      on Jaya and Vijaya by Sanatkumara and the other sages, the curse on King
      Indradyumna who became Gajendra, and the curse on Nalakubara and Manigriva
      by sage Narada. The curse laid on Sudarsana by the sages contains aspects
      which make it fit into both the categories, as will be clear from the
      sequel. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>It will first be explained how the present curse falls under the
      first category. The Vidyadhara named Sudarsana had become very haughty
      because of his beauty. Haughtiness is the greatest of all obstacles to
      spiritual progress. The sages therefore temporarily deprived him of the
      cause of his haughtiness, namely his good looks and made him take the very
      repulsive form of a python. This turned out to be a blessing because he
      got the touch of the Lord's foot. Not only did he then get a form which
      was even more resplendent than his original form, but he also realized
      that what he had done in his haughtiness was a great sin. He thus became
      free from pride and so fit for spiritual progress. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>The curse pronounced by the sages on Sudarsana can be brought under
      the second category also. Since the Vidyadhara was so proud of his beauty
      that he was contemptuous of others who were not so endowed, he would, on
      that count itself, be deprived of beauty in his next birth. This is what
      happened to him when he was born as a python. The curse only reiterated
      what would have happened even without it. The offence committed need not
      necessarily be against sages who have the power to curse. Such an offence
      even against ordinary persons would have led to the same result of
      depriving him of whatever he was proud of, in his next birth. The lesson
      conveyed by this story is that one should never be proud of one's wealth,
      pedigree, good looks, learning or any other accomplishment and look down
      on others not so fortunate. Every one should remember that this is not the
      only birth and what one has in this birth may not necessarily be his in a
      subsequent birth. It is the thoughts and actions in this birth that will
      determine what the next birth will be. If a person who is rich becomes
      arrogant and treats the poor with contempt or uses his wealth for doing
      harm to others, he will be born as a beggar in his next birth. There is no
      guarantee that a person who is rich in this birth will remain so in future
      births also. If he uses his wealth for good purposes he may have the good
      fortune of being rich in the next birth also. This is the real meaning of
      the well known saying that no one can carry his wealth with him when he
      dies. The same logic applies to all natural talents and gifts that one is
      born with. One should be humble about them and use them for good purposes.
      Leave alone losing in the next birth; one may lose his or her beauty or
      wealth or other accomplishments even during this birth
      itself because of illness and various other causes. We have to remember
      that everything in this world is transient. If this thought is always kept
      in mind, one will never swerve from the right path. These are the lessons
      that we can draw from this story. <o:p>

      </span>A former Pontiff of the Sringeri Mutt explained in a discourse the
      reason for persons being born blind, dumb, etc. If a person does not make
      use of his faculties of speech, etc., to help
      another person in a situation in which such help is crucial, he will be
      born without that faculty in his next birth. To illustrate, supposing two
      boys are playing in a village. One of them suddenly falls into a well. If
      the other boy immediately shouts for help, neighbours would rush to the
      place and would probably be able to rescue the boy from the well. If,
      instead, the other boy just walks away, fearing that he may be blamed for
      his friend falling into the well, with the result that the boy who fell
      into the well loses his life, the boy who did not use his faculty of
      speech at the proper time will be born dumb in his next birth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>In a Puranic story such an episode would be put this way. The boy
      did not try to save his friend by using his voice and so he was cursed by
      the dead boy's parents or by some sage to become dumb.<o:p>

      </span>The slaying of Narakasura is described in chapter 59 of Skandha X
      of Srimad Bhagavatam.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Narakasura, described as a son of Bhumidevi, was a very wicked
      Asura who terrorised the whole earth. He conquered many kings and carried
      away 16,100 young women from their families and kept them in captivity. On
      coming to know of this, Krishna marched against him. Krishna was first
      opposed by Mura, an Asura with five faces, who was an associate of
      Narakasura. After killing Mura, Krishna killed Narakasura also and
      released all the women. He then married all of them. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>A careful study will show that the entire teachings of Vedanta are
      conveyed through this simple story. The first significant fact is the
      description of Narakasura as the son of Bhumi, the Earth. Bhumi or earth
      is one of the five elements, the other four being water, fire, air and
      space. In Vedanta there is a figure of speech called 'upalakshana' by
      which, when one item of a group is specifically
      mentioned, all the other items of the group are also to be taken as
      implied. Thus the mention of 'earth' here is to be taken as implying all
      the five elements. This conclusion is further supported by the following
      statements in the Bhashya of Sri Sankara on Brahmasutra.
      3.1.2:--&quot;Water consists of three components, according to the
      Upanishadic text about the elements becoming tripartite (Ch. Up. VI. iii).
      So when water is admitted as the constituent, the other two elements must
      also be admitted. Moreover, the body is the product of the three elements
      since all three, fire, water and earth, are seen to be its
      constituents&quot;. Only three elements are mentioned here because the
      discussion is about a statement in the Chandogya Upanishad which mentions
      only the triplication of these three elements. When quintuplication of the
      five elements is considered, it follows that all the five elements should
      be considered as represented by the term 'earth'. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>Narakasura is said to be the son of the earth, which means
      allegorically that he is the product of the five elements. Vedanta says
      that the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>body (both physical
      and subtle) is made up of, or is the product of, the five elements. That
      is to say, Narakasura stands for the body. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>All living beings are kept in bondage by the body. This is what is
      implied by the statement that Narakasura had kept the women in captivity.
      The women are the jivas who are imprisoned in the body. The name 'Narakasura'
      is also significant. Being a slave to the body is itself Naraka or hell.
      Liberation is freedom from the bondage or limitation of the body. By
      slaying Narakasura the Lord, in His infinite compassion for His devotees,
      liberated them from bondage. The story also brings out the fact that God's
      grace is essential for getting liberation. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </span>There is another very significant point in this story. Mura, the
      associate of Narakasura, is said to have five
      faces. These five faces stand for the five organs of sense which have
      first to be conquered and this is what the Lord did. The name 'Mura' is
      itself significant. The verb 'mura' means 'envelope'. (mura samveshtane--
      Panini's Dhatupatha, No. 1287). Mura therefore stands for ignorance or
      'nescience' which envelopes the jiva. <o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>On attaining liberation the jiva becomes one with Brahman. This is
      the real import of the statement that the Lord married all the women who
      were released. 'Marriage' means becoming one with the Lord.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
