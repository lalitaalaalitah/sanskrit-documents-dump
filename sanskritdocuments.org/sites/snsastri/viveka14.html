<p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><font size="4">The unreal (mithya) nature of
the universe</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Brahman is absolute existence and pure consciousness. It is infinite,
pure, supreme, self-luminous, of the nature of eternal bliss, non-different from
the indwelling self, and without parts. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="4">It is the only reality. The universe which
is superimposed on it is not different from it, just as the illusory snake is
not different from the rope on which it appears. A pot made of clay is not
different from the clay. There is no separate entity as pot apart from clay. The
pot is only a name given to clay in a particular shape. When the same clay is
given another shape it is given the name ‘plate’. So what really exists is
only clay, and names such as pot are imaginary. The Chandogya upanishad, 6.1.4
says, “All modification (of clay) is nothing but name based on words; the clay
alone is real”. Similarly everything that is the effect of Brahman is nothing
but Brahman. The appearance of the universe as an entity separate from Brahman
is due only to delusion caused by nescience. The Mundaka upanishad declares that
this universe is nothing but the supreme Brahman. If the universe were real, the
statement in the srutis that Brahman is infinite would become invalid, the Vedas
would lose their authority and Isvara’s words would become untrue. Such a
result is not acceptable. If the world is real it should appear in dreamless
sleep also. As it is not at all perceived in dreamless sleep, it is unreal like
objects seen in dream. Therefore it is clear that the universe does not exist
apart from Brahman.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Therefore the supreme Brahman is the only reality. It is pure
consciousness, without beginning or end, and devoid of any activity. It is pure
eternal bliss. It is free from all differences brought about by Maya. It is
eternal, unchanging, pure, beyond the faculty of reasoning, formless, subtle,
and self-effulgent. It is beyond the trichotomy of knower, knowledge and known.
It is beyond mind and speech. <o:p>
