        kinds—phenomenal and eternal. The former is a modification of the mind
        when it stretches out through the eyes. It is dependent on the objects
        perceived. It has a beginning and an end. But the latter is the very
        nature of the Self, just as heat and light are the very nature of the
        sun. The Self is said to be a seer, hearer, thinker, etc, only when it
        it is associated with the respective limiting adjuncts such as the eye,
        ear, mind, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText3"><font face="Arial" size="4">Vision is of two
        kinds, phenomenal and real. Phenomenal vision is an action of the mind
        when connected with the eye. It is an act and has therefore a beginning
        and an end. But the vision that belongs to the Self is like the heat and
        light of fire, being the very essence of the witness; it has neither
        beginnig nor end. The ordinary or phenomenal vision, however, is
        coloured by the objects seen through the eye. It begins when the eye
        comes into contact with the object and ends when the contact ends. The
        eternal vision of the Self is only metaphorically spoken of as the
        witness. It is a witness only when it is looked upon as associated with
        the limiting adjuncts, namely, the mind, body, etc. By itself it is only
        pure consciousness and cannot be described even as a witness.</font></p>
