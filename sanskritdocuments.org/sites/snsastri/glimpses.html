mso-ansi-language:EN-US;layout-grid-mode:line">darsana', a Sanskrit word meaning
        'seeing' or 'experiencing'. This indicates that the aim of philosophy in
        India is direct experience of the ultimate Reality and not mere
        intellectual speculation as in Western philosophy. The Indian
        philosophical systems are classified into two broad categories known as
        'aastika darsanas' and</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">
        'n</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
layout-grid-mode:line">aastika darsanas'. There are no exact equivalents to
        these terms in English, though the terms 'orthodox' and 'unorthodox' are
        sometimes used. It would be wholly misleading to use the terms
        'theistic' and 'atheistic' for these categories. The term 'aastika' has
        been defined as referring to a person who, or a system which, accepts,
        (1) the authority of the Vedas, (2) the doctrine of rebirth and (3) the
        existence of other 'lokas' or spheres of experience. In the category of
        aastika darsanas fall those systems which accept the authority of the
        Vedas. These are the six systems known as Nyaya, Vaiseshika, Sankhya,
        Yoga, Purvamimamsa and Uttaramimamsa (or Vedanta). Even among these six,
        it is only the last two that base themselves directly on the Vedas and
        accept nothing that goes against them. The other four systems are based
        more on independent grounds of logic and reasoning, but they too are not
        opposed to the Vedas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        </span>All the six aastika darsanas regard the Vedas as the record of
        the divine truths revealed to the sages (Rishis or seers) in their
        supra-normal consciousness. The sages are not the authors of the Vedas.
        They are known as 'seers' of the Vedic mantras. The traditional view is
        that the Vedas are eternal. The word 'Veda' means primarily 'knowledge'
        and secondarily the books in which that knowledge is recorded. This is
        not knowledge of the external world, but the knowledge of the supreme
        Truth which cannot be attained by any effort of the human mind. It has
        been categorically declared by our ancient sages that the Vedas have no
        validity in matters which fall within the domain of other valid means of
        knowledge such as perception and inference. Sri Sankara says in his
        Bhashya on the Bhagavadgita, ch.18, verse 66: &quot;The validity of the
        Vedas holds good only with regard to matters which cannot be known
        through such other valid means of knowledge as direct perception, etc.,
        because the validity of the Vedas lies in revealing what is beyond
        direct perception. Even a hundred Vedic statements cannot become valid
        if they say that fire is cold or non-luminous. If a Vedic text says that
        fire is cold or non-luminous, one should assume that the intended
        meaning of the text is different, for otherwise its validity cannot be
        maintained. One should not interpret it in such a way as to contradict
        some other valid means of knowledge&quot;. <o:p>

font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;layout-grid-mode:line"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Because of this clear demarcation of the spheres of validity of
        the Vedas on the one hand and the other means of knowledge relied on by
        science on the other, no conflict between science and the Vedas can
        arise, similar to those which arose between the Church and the
        discoveries of scientists like Copernicus and Galileo in Europe. It is
        this knowledge contained in the Vedas that is considered to be eternal.
        Just as the law of gravity existed and operated even before it was
        discovered by Newton, the knowledge contained in the Vedas existed even
        before it became known to the sages. <o:p>

font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;layout-grid-mode:line"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The Vedas are considered to be 'apaurusheya', i.e., they are not
        human compositions. Even God is not the author of the Vedas. The eternal
        knowledge contained in the Vedas is only revealed by God to the sages in
        each cycle of creation. The Vedas are 'seen' or 'heard' by the sages and
        recorded by them or their disciples for the benefit of posterity. The
        Vedas are therefore termed sruti, or 'what is heard'. As distinguished
        from these are the smritis, which are all human compositions, based on
        the srutis. The Itihasas and Puranas come under the category of smriti.
        According to Manu, the greatest lawgiver of India, the smritis should be
        considered as an elaboration of the Vedas. However, it is an inviolable
        rule that, where there is a difference between the sruti and the smriti
        on any matter, the sruti has to be upheld and the smriti should be
        interpreted in conformity with it. </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">The truths enshrined in the Vedas have been
        actually experienced again and again by successive generations of great
        souls. The experiences of great saints like Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
        and Bhagavan Ramana in recent times bear testimony to the authenticity
        of all that is stated in the </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;

font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;layout-grid-mode:line"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The Vedas are four in number-- Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and
        Atharvaveda. Each Veda consists of three parts-- the karma-kanda, the
        upasana-kanda and the jnana-kanda. The karma-kanda is divided into
        samhitas and brahmanas. The samhitas are collections of mantras, or
        hymns in verse, most of which are praises or prayers addressed to
        various gods such as Indra, Varuna and Agni. They are chanted during the
        performance of sacrifices. The brahmanas<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>are mostly in prose and contain detailed descriptions of
        sacrifices and instructions for the performance of sacrificial rites.
        The upasana-kanda deals with various meditations. The jnana-kanda
        consists of the Upanishads and this is what is denoted by the term
        'Vedanta'.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;layout-grid-mode:line"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>These three kandas are, however, not mutually exclusive
        compartments. The highest philosophical truths, similar to those
        expounded in the Upanishads, are found also in the samhita and brahmana
        portions which deal mainly with Vedic rituals. It is further noteworthy
        that the Isavasyopanishad appears in the samhita portion of the Sukla
        Yajurveda, the Brihadaranyakopanishad forms the concluding portion of
        the Satapathabrahmana of the Sukla Yajurveda, the Chandogyopanishad
        constitutes eight chapters of the Chandogyabrahmana of Samaveda and the
        Kenopanishad forms the ninth chapter of the Talavakarabrahmana of
        Samaveda. All these form part of jnanakanda, in spite of their being
        located right inside the samhitas or brahmanas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The term 'Vedanta' should therefore be understood to mean the
        ultimate conclusion or the highest philosophy of the Vedas and not the
        end portion of the Vedas.</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><o:p>

        teacher of Advaita, says, Advaita has no quarrel with any system of
        philosophy. While the pluralistic world-views may be in conflict with
        one another, Advaita is not opposed to any of them. It recognises the
        measure of truth that there is in each of them; but only, that truth is
        not the whole. Hostility arises out of partial vision. When the whole
        truth is realised, there can be no hostility. (Mandukya Karika, III. 17

        </span>Brahman is the only Reality. 'Reality' is defined as that which
        does not undergo any change at any time. By this test, Brahman, which is
        absolutely changeless and eternal, is alone real. The world keeps on
        changing all the time and so it cannot be considered as real. At the
        same time, we cannot dismiss it as unreal, because it is actually
        experienced by us. The example of a rope being mistaken for a snake in
        dim light is used to explain this. The snake so seen produces the same
        reaction, such as fear and trembling of the limbs, as a real snake
        would. It cannot therefore be said to be totally unreal. At the same
        time, on examination with the help of a lamp it is found that the snake
        never existed and that the rope alone was there all the time. The snake
        cannot be described as both real and unreal, because these two
        contradictory qualities cannot exist in the same substance. It must
        therefore be said that the snake is neither real nor unreal. Such an
        object is described as 'mithya'. Just as the snake appears because of
        ignorance of the fact that there is only a rope, this world appears to
        exist because of our ignorance of Brahman. Thus the world is also
        neither real nor unreal; it is also 'mithya'. Just as the snake is
        superimposed on the rope, the world is superimposed on Brahman. Our
        ignorance of Brahman is what is called </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
layout-grid-mode:line">avidya or ajnaana </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">or
        nescience. This ignorance not only makes us ignorant of Brahman, but it
        projects the world as a reality. The world has no reality apart from
        Brahman, just as the illusory snake has no reality apart from the rope.
        When the knowledge of Brahman arises, the world is seen as a mere
        appearance of Brahman. The illusory snake arose from the rope, was
        sustained by the rope and ultimately merged into the rope. Similarly,
        the world arises from Brahman, is sustained by Brahman and merges into
        Brahman on the attainment of knowledge. Another example is also given to
        explain this. Ornaments of different sizes and shapes are made out of
        one gold bar. Their appearance and the use for which they are meant
        vary, but the fact that they are all really nothing but gold, in spite
        of their different appearances and uses, cannot be denied. The
        appearance may change, a bangle may be converted into rings, but the
        gold always remains as gold. When we begin to look upon the bangles,
        rings, etc., as nothing but gold in essence, the differences between
        bangle and ring, ring and chain, etc., cease to count though they
        continue to retain their different shapes. Similarly, on the dawn of the
        knowledge of Brahman<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(which
        is the same as the Self), though the different forms continue to be seen
        by the </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;

font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">the realised soul, he sees them all
        only as appearances of the one Brahman. Thus the perception of
        difference between one person and another, or one thing and another, and
        the consequences of such perception, such as looking upon some as
        favourable and others as the opposite, and the consequent efforts to
        retain or get what is favourable and to get rid of or avoid what is not
        favourable, come to an end. This is the state of liberation even while
        living, which is known as J</span><span style="font-size:

        </span>Every individual identifies himself with the physical body, the
        sense organs and the mind. When a person describes himself as stout or
        lean or fair-complexioned or dark, he is looking upon himself as the
        physical body to which these characteristics belong. When he says 'I
        see', 'I hear', 'I smell' and so on, he is identifying himself with the
        organs of sense which perform these functions. When he says 'I am happy'
        or 'I am unhappy', he is identifying himself with his mind. The
        Upanishads declare that all these identifications are wrong and that the
        human being is in reality not the body or the sense-organs or the mind,
        but Brahman, which is eternal, changeless and not affected by anything
        that happens to the body-mind complex. It is Brahman that appears as the
        jiva or individual because of identification with the body-mind complex.
        This body-mind complex, which makes the infinite, all-pervading Brahman
        appear as an individual limited to a particular body-mind complex, is
        known as the limiting adjunct or up</span><span style="font-size:

        of Brahman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This wrong
        identification, which is called bondage, is due to our ignorance of our
        real nature. This ignorance is what is called avidy</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;

        </span></i><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">or
        nescience. When this ignorance is eradicated, the person remains
        established in his essence as the Self or Brahman-Atman. This is
        liberation. Thus liberation is not the attainment of some new state in
        some other world after the end of the present life. It is only the
        realisation, in this life itself, of what one has always been, namely
        Brahman, by the removal of the wrong notion that one is the body-mind
        complex. The illusory snake never existed. What existed even when the
        snake was seen was only the rope. Similarly, bondage has no real
        existence at all. Even when we are ignorant of Brahman and think of
        ourselves as limited by the body, we are really none other than the
        infinite Brahman. Liberation is thus only the removal of the wrong
        identification with the body, mind and senses. The attainment of the

        paths are laid down in the scriptures as the means to the attainment of

font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;layout-grid-mode:line">jnaana
        </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">yoga.
        Here the word 'yoga' signifies 'the means'. That is to say, karma,
        bhakti sand </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
layout-grid-mode:line">jnaana </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">are the means to the attainment of
        liberation. These are, however, not independent paths, but are
        intrinsically bound together. Karma yoga is the performance of all
        duties enjoined upon one by the scriptures, as well as the duties that
        are incumbent on one because of one's station in life. If these duties
        are performed without craving for the fruit of the actions and as an
        offering to God, they lead to purification of the mind by the
        eradication of desires and the evil consequences of desire, namely,
        greed, anger, jealousy and other negative emotions. The very fact that
        all actions must be performed as an offering to God implies that one
        must have devotion to God. Thus the path of bhakti or devotion to God
        and the path of action, or karma yoga are intrinsically bound together
        and one cannot be practised without the other. Thus karma yoga and
        bhakti yoga form one composite whole. As stated above, karma yoga is the
        means by which the mind becomes purified by the removal of all
        impurities in the form of desire, anger, greed, delusion, pride and
        jealousy. Bhakti yoga brings about concentration of mind. Only a mind
        which has become pure and one-pointed is capable of attaining
        self-knowledge. </span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;

        </span>We all know from our experience that no two persons are identical
        in their thoughts, their likes and dislikes, reaction to situations and
        so on. What is the reason for this diversity?. If we examine the
        composition of a human being we find that he is made up of three
        components. The first is the outer, physical body consisting of skin,
        muscles, bones, blood and the like. Then there is the mind, which term
        includes the intellect. The third is consciousness. The physical body is
        made up of the same chemicals in all human beings and so it cannot be
        the cause of the difference in character between one person and another.
        The consciousness is the same in all. We thus see that it is the mind
        that is the cause of diversity. According to our scriptures the mind
        performs four functions. These are--(1) evaluating the pros and cons of
        any situation, (2) ultimately coming to a decision on what is to be
        done, (3) storing the experiences and (4) identifying actions, thoughts,
        etc as one's own, in the form 'I am doing this', 'I did this', 'I am
        happy', 'I am sad', etc. The manner in which these functions take place
        can be explained by taking an illustration. I am walking along the road
        and I see at a distance a person whose gait seems to resemble that of a
        certain friend of mine, named Raman. I begin to debate whether the
        person I see at a distance is Raman or not. When he comes nearer and I
        am able to see his face clearly, I compare it with the memory of the
        face of Raman stored in my mind. If I find that the two tally, I decide
        that he is Raman and I greet him. It will be clear from this example
        that my decision and subsequent action are governed by the memory of the
        face of Raman stored in my mind. To generalise, all our reactions to
        various situations are governed by the impressions and experiences
        stored in the mind. Every action performed by us and every thought that
        arises in us leaves an impression on the mind. We do not of course
        remember all our actions and thoughts, but all of them leave
        impressions. These impressions are what are known in our scriptures as
        samskaras or vasanas. It is these that decide how we react to particular
        situations. If the actions and thoughts are good, they leave good
        impressions and these will make the person act in a manner that
        contributes to the good of others and ultimately to his own good. Bad
        actions and thoughts leave bad impressions and these will make the
        person act in a manner that causes harm to others and ultimately to
        himself also. It is because of this that we are instructed by our
        scriptures to always do good deeds and think good thoughts and to
        refrain from all evil acts and thoughts. When a person acts in a manner
        beneficial to others, he feels joy at having made some one else happy.
        Selfishness, jealousy, anger, haughtiness and other such negative
        attitudes and emotions arise from the evil impressions left by evil
        thoughts and deeds. A person who is jealous, selfish, angry or haughty
        cannot be happy and he himself is the person who suffers most from such
        evil traits. On the other hand, a person who always harbours goodwill
        towards others will himself be always happy. Every individual is born
        with the impressions, both good and bad, which he had accumulated by his
        actions and thoughts in past births. When he dies, the impressions
        gathered in his mind go with him and will be present in his mind in the
        next birth. When a person dies, it is only his physical body that is
        cremated. His mind, which is called the subtle body in the scriptures,
        goes to other worlds and then comes back again to this earth in another
        body. Whether a person is born as a human being or as an animal, bird
        and so on depends on the impressions of his actions and thoughts left in
        his mind at the time of the death of his previous body. Even those who
        have been born with bad impressions can, by their effort, erase those
        bad impressions and create good impressions by their good actions and
        thoughts. This is what our scriptures exhort us to do. The ultimate goal
        of human life is to go beyond the cycle of repeated births and deaths.
        The essential requisite for this is the purification of the mind. A pure
        mind is one which is free from cravings for worldly pleasures. The
        Upanishads say that the mind itself is the cause of bondage which is the
        root cause of all sorrow, as well as of liberation which is a state of
        supreme bliss. The mind becomes the cause of bondage and consequent
        sorrow when it is agitated by desires. The same mind, when freed of
        desires, is the means to liberation. The secret of happiness thus lies
        in ridding the mind of all desires and elevating it by fixing it on the
        contemplation and worship of God. <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>There is an episode in Chapter 34 of Skandha X of Srimad
        Bhagavatam which illustrates vividly how haughtiness leads to downfall
        and suffering. Once the cow-herds of Gokula went, along with Lord
        Krishna, to a place called 'Ambikavanam'. Having bathed in the Saraswati
        river, they worshipped Lord Siva and His consort Goddess Ambika. They
        passed the night on the bank of the river, praying and fasting. Suddenly
        a python appeared and began to devour Krishna's father Nandagopa.
        Hearing Nandagopa's cries the cowherds rushed to his rescue and
        belaboured the python with firebrands. In spite of severe beating the
        python did not release Nandagopa from its hold. Krishna then went and
        touched the python with his foot. At once the python changed into a very
        resplendent Vidyadhara (a semi-divine being). The Vidyadhara told
        Krishna &quot;I am a Vidyadhara by name Sudarsana. Being endowed with
        extraordinary beauty and wealth, I was very haughty. Once, in my
        haughtiness, I ridiculed some great sages of the Angirasa line for their
        rather ugly looks. The sages cursed that I would become a python. You
        have now saved me from the effect of the curse&quot;. By being haughty
        because of his beauty he became a python which is a very repulsive
        creature. The lesson we have to learn from this story is that if a
        person is haughty because of his beautiful looks, he will be deprived of
        his beauty and will be born as a very ugly creature in his next birth.
        The story of the curse making the Vidyadhara a python is only another
        way of bringing out this truth. Extending this logic, it follows that if
        a person is haughty because of his wealth and therefore treats the poor
        with contempt or misuses his wealth to harm others, he will be born as a
        beggar in his next birth. If a person is haughty because of his
        learning, he will be deprived of learning and will be an illiterate
        person in his next birth. The lesson therefore is this. Never be haughty
        because of your wealth, beauty, learning or other accomplishments, but
        cultivate humility. Be kind and considerate to others who are less
        fortunate than you and do all that you can to help them. <o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Thus we find that the only way to get better births in future and
        to attain liberation ultimately is to strive hard to discard all evil
        traits which one is born with and to make the mind free from desires.
        These can be achieved only by the grace of God. The cultivation of
        intense devotion to God is therefore the prime requisite for the
        attainment of happiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        </span>The purpose of the Puranas is to expound the abstruse teachings
        of Vedanta in a manner easily intelligible to the common man. This is
        done through the medium of stories which convey profound truths under a
        very attractive garb. It happens sometimes that the same episode is
        narrated with substantial differences in different Puranas. This is
        because the stories themselves are not important; what are important are
        the lessons we derive from them. This is being stated here at the very
        outset because the story of Suka as it appears in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Devi Bhagavatam, which is going to be narrated here, will be
        found to be totally at variance with what is found in Srimad Bhagavatam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </span>The main Puranas are eighteen in number. The authorship of all of
        them, except one, Vishnupurana, is attributed to sage Vyasa. Sage
        Parasara, father of sage Vyasa, is considered to be the author of
        Vishnupurana. Of these, the two which are considered to be the most
        important are Srimad Bhagavatam and Devi Bhagavatam. The former is
        devoted to a description of the various incarnations of Lord Vishnu and
        the narration of His glories. The latter extols the glory of Bhagavati
        or Parasakti. Each of these Puranas contains about 18000 verses divided
        into twelve Skandhas. In Srimad Bhagavatam there are 335 chapters and in
        Devi Bhagavatam there are 318 chapters. <o:p>

        </span>Lord Vishnu (or Narayana) and Bhagavati (or Narayani) are two
        aspects of the same Supreme Reality known as Brahman in the Upanishads.
        The concept of the Supreme Being as the Divine Mother of the universe
        has its basis in the Vedas themselves. The Rigveda contains the famous
        Devi Sukta, proclaimed, significantly, by a woman seer, Rishi Ambhrini.
        This hymn may be said to have laid the foundation for the whole doctrine
        of the manifestation of Chit-sakti as the universe and Her immanence in
        it. <o:p>

        </span>After composing Devi Bhagavatam, sage Vyasa taught it to his son
        Suka. At this time Vyasa had a disciple who is referred to merely as 'Suta'.
        While Vyasa was teaching the Devi Bhagavatam to Suka, his disciple, Suta,
        who was present, also learnt it. It was Suta who narrated the Devi
        Bhagavatam to Saunaka and other sages in Naimisharanya, a very sacred
        spot. <o:p>

        </span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">Suka,
        the son of sage Vyasa, was the very incarnation of Vairagya
        (detachment). Soon after his birth he became the disciple of Brihaspati,
        the preceptor of the gods. After completing the study of all the
        scriptures within a very short period, he returned to his father's
        hermitage. In course of time Vyasa began to think of getting his son
        married, as only then would he become entitled to perform the religious
        duties prescribed in the Vedas for a house-holder. One day sage Vyasa
        told Suka, &quot;My son, you have mastered the Vedas and all the other
        scriptures. You must now enter the stage of the grihasta by taking a
        wife. Only a grihasta can properly propitiate the manes and the gods.
        Your duty to me will also be fulfilled only if you marry. The scriptures
        say that one who has no son cannot get access to heaven. I am therefore
        very eager that you should marry. You were born as my son as the result
        of intense austerities practised by me. It is therefore your duty to
        fulfil my wish by getting married&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </span>Suka replied: &quot;Father, it is no doubt true that a son should
        act according to the wishes of his father. But, at the same time, the
        father has a duty to give such advice to his son as would lead the
        latter to the highest good. I am surprised that you, who are so learned,
        are talking like an ignorant man bewildered by the power of Maya. You
        say that you want me to be happy. The happiness produced by worldly
        enjoyments is always mixed with sorrow. Is that real happiness? If I get
        married, I will have to act according to the wishes of the woman I
        marry. How can there be happiness when there is dependence on the will
        of another? One who has been bound by an iron chain may at some time be
        able to free oneself, but one can never free oneself from the bonds of
        his wife and children. Will one whose mind is set on the supreme bliss
        find any attraction in the pleasures of the flesh which are trivial and
        always mixed with sorrow? Instead of rescuing me from this ocean of
        Samsara, why are you trying to immerse me deeper into it? It is only the
        ignorant who will find happiness in worldly life, just as worms are
        happy in filth. One who, even after having attained a human birth which
        is so difficult to get and having, in addition, studied all the
        scriptures, is still attached to the world, is no better than a dog or a
        pig. Only that person is really learned who strives for liberation from
        Samsara&quot;. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>To this Vyasa said: &quot;What you say may, on the surface,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>appear to be quite logical, but the fact is that you are
        labouring under some wrong notions. What binds a man is not wife or
        children or home but the mind. One who is mentally free is not bound
        even if he has a family and one who is not mentally free is in bondage
        even if he is outwardly in the Sannyasa Ashrama. Whether a person lives
        in a house or a hermitage or in the forest, it is the mind that is the
        cause of bondage as well as of liberation. A householder who does not
        swerve from the path of righteousness, performs all the duties ordained
        by the scriptures and does not harm any creature is truly a liberated
        person. All the other three Ashramas depend on the householder for
        sustenance. How exalted the Grihastashrama is! Heaven and liberation are
        within easy reach of one who conducts his life according to the
        scriptures, in whatever Ashrama he may be. One who transgresses the
        tenets of the scriptures has no hope of spiritual evolution, even if he
        is a Sannyasi. The stage of the householder is as difficult as it is
        exalted. The way to the fourth stage, Sannyasa, is through that of the
        householder. There is a great risk in jumping from Brahmacharya to
        Sannyasa. The right path is to live the life of a householder in
        accordance with the scriptures, then hand over the responsibility of the
        household to the son, take Vanaprastha and then Sannyasa. You know that
        the mind and the senses are very powerful. They are likely to make a man
        go astray. A Brahmachari should, therefore, get married at the proper
        time. It is very difficult to control the senses when one is young. For
        your own good, therefore, you should get married. There is nothing wrong
        whatsoever in this course&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>On hearing these words of his father Suka replied: &quot;Whatever
        you may say, I will not marry. Marriage is undoubtedly a bondage. It can
        never bring real happiness. One who gets married will have to worry
        about the means of earning wealth. One whose mind is occupied with the
        thought of acquiring wealth can never be happy. If he is not able to
        earn money and remains poor, his relations will treat him with contempt.
        If he earns wealth, there will be other problems. To earn wealth one has
        to deviate from the path of righteousness. One who strictly adheres to
        the path of righteousness can never become rich. Indra, the king of the
        gods, has all the wealth of the three worlds at his command. But is he
        happy? He is afraid even of the starving ascetic. You know all this as
        well as I do. And yet you are trying to push me deeper into this
        terrible Samsara. The sorrow caused by birth, old age, disease and stay
        in the mother's womb can all be borne. But the sorrow caused by desire
        is worse than all these. Because of desire, even those who have mastered
        the Vedas and all the other scriptures wait at the door of the rich to
        get something. They bow low before him. They praise him to the skies.
        All this is just to fill the belly. Cannot the belly be filled with some
        fruit or root or leaf which can be got in the forest? Instead of that,
        why should one build a prison for oneself with wife and children? I am
        not in the least attracted by the Karma Kanda of the Vedas. Please
        therefore impart to me Jnana or Yoga. Tell me the means by which I can
        destroy all my Karma-- Sanchita, Prarabdha and Agami. Please do not talk
        to me again about the bondage that marriage undoubtedly is&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        </span>On hearing these words of his son Vyasa was overwhelmed by grief.
        Tears came streaming down his cheeks. His body began to tremble. Seeing
        all this Suka said to himself--&quot; O God! My father is reacting as if
        what I am proposing to do is a heinous crime. He is the author of the
        Vedanta sutras, the Puranas and the Mahabharata. He has divided the
        Vedas into four. He is reputed to be omniscient and a man of perfect
        discrimination. But see how Maya has overpowered even him! None can
        conquer this Maya. Even the Trinity (Brahma, Vishnu and Siva) act
        according to the commands of the Devi, who is Mahamaya&quot;. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Then he spoke to Vyasa thus: &quot;You who are so learned are
        grieving like an ignorant man. How strange! What is the meaning of the
        words 'father', 'son' and the like? Who is the father and who is the
        son? Think who I, now your son, was in a previous birth. Is it not mere
        delusion to think &quot;I am so and so&quot;? Give up your grief,
        knowing that all this is Maya. What good can accrue to you from me? Each
        one has to undergo the consequences of his past actions. It is therefore
        meaningless to think that one can benefit or suffer due to the actions
        of some other person. A human birth on the earth is extremely difficult
        to get and even more so is birth in a noble family of learned persons.
        What a great pity it will be if one wastes such a birth by being
        overpowered by Maya!&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Vyasa was astonished to see such intense detachment in his son.
        He said: &quot;O child, I am very happy to see your firm detachment. If
        it is still your desire to take Sannyasa you may do so. Such intense
        detachment is very rarely to be found. The scriptures say that persons
        with such total detachment can take Sannyasa direct from Brahmacharya.
        All the same, it will be good for you to study the Bhagavatam which I
        have composed. It is equal to the Vedas themselves. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Following Vyasa's advice, Suka studied the Bhagavatam. But even
        that did not clear his doubts and give him satisfaction. Vyasa then told
        him, &quot;If my Bhagavatam has not cleared all your doubts, I advise
        you to go to the kingdom of Mithila. A king by name Janaka, who is a
        liberated soul, is governing that kingdom. He will clear all your
        doubts&quot;. <o:p>

        </span>Suka was surprised to hear this and told his father: &quot;O
        father, what you say is very strange. A king who is governing a country
        is a Jivanmukta! You say that he will clear my doubts which even you
        have not been able to clear! Do you want me to go for advice to a
        householder, and that too a king who is ruling a country? To say that a
        Jivanmukta is ruling a country is as absurd as saying that a barren
        woman has given birth to a son. How can a king conquer his senses? Can
        one who is free from the notions of 'I' and 'mine' rule a country? How
        can a ruler who enjoys kingly pleasures, who distinguishes between heat
        and cold, pleasant and unpleasant, friend and foe, be a Jivanmukta? Can
        he look upon saint and sinner, sage and thief, friend and foe with an
        equal eye? If he can, how can he function as a ruler? If he cannot, how
        can he be a Jivanmukta? No one has seen a king who is also a Jivanmukta.
        All the same, I shall take your advice and go and see this Janaka&quot;.

        </span>Suka walked through town and country, hills and dales, forests
        and fields; he passed through places inhabited by people following
        diverse customs and religious practices. At the end of three years he
        reached Mithila. At the entrance to the kingdom of Janaka the guards
        stopped him and asked him who he was and why he had come there. Suka
        stood motionless, without uttering a word in reply. The guards told him
        that they had orders from the king not to let anybody into the country
        without making full enquiries and finding out what he wanted. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Suka then told them, &quot;My object in coming here has been
        achieved by your stopping me. It appears that even a Sadhu cannot enter
        the kingdom of Janaka who is said to be a Jivanmukta!. I have come here
        after crossing two huge mountains and braving great odds. It was none
        other than my father who prompted me to come here. But I do not blame
        him. It is the result of my own karma. Men are generally tempted by
        money, but I have absolutely no desire for money. It is only my
        Prarabdha karma that brought me here. It is strange that in this country
        which is ruled by a Jivanmukta even a Sadhu is not allowed to
        enter!&quot;. So saying, Suka continued to stand there. The guards then
        said, &quot;O revered sir, we have now realised that you are a Mahatma.
        Please go in and forgive us for having stopped you&quot;.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Suka replied, &quot;You have not done anything wrong. It is the
        duty of a servant to obey implicitly the orders of his master. You have
        been very correct in the performance of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>your duty and you should be commended for that. Nor is the king
        at fault. It is the duty of<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>the king to find out whether a person entering his kingdom is
        worthy or not, whether he is an honest man or a thief, and so on.
        Without thinking about all this I have come here. It is wrong to enter
        another's house without being invited. That is what I have done. The
        fault is, therefore, entirely mine&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </span>The guards then wanted to know from him the real import of the
        terms 'happiness', 'unhappiness', 'honour', 'dishonour', 'friend',
        'enemy', etc,. Suka explained that when a person finds his wife, son and
        others behaving in the manner in which he wants them to behave, he feels
        happy. If not, he feels unhappy. In other words, happiness arises when a
        person finds other persons and things around him to be favourable to him
        and unhappiness when they are unfavourable. Every one is all the time
        engaged in actions which are expected to bring happiness. Those who help
        him in this are considered to be friends and those who hinder him are
        considered enemies. A wise man is one who does not crave for worldly
        pleasures which attract the ignorant. For a man free from desires
        happiness lies in being alone and meditating on the Self. Contentment is
        his friend. Desire, anger and the like are his enemies. <o:p>
        </o:p>

        </span>Suka then entered the country of Mithila and continued to walk.
        When he reached the gates of the king's palace, he was stopped by the
        guards there. As before, he stood motionless, without uttering a word.
        Soon the king's minister went to the gate, having heard of the arrival
        of Suka. He saluted Suka and took him inside. There, in one of the inner
        chambers of the palace, a number of beautiful young damsels came to
        attend on him. The minister left, leaving Suka with the damsels. Suka
        sat down and went into meditation. All the efforts of the damsels to
        distract him and make him take interest in them failed.<o:p>
        </o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </span>King Janaka himself then came there and after respectfully bowing
        before Suka he took Suka to his assembly hall. The king then asked Suka
        the reason for his visit. Suka said, &quot;O king, you have perhaps by
        now come to know that I am the son of sage Vyasa. After completing my
        studies under Brihaspati, I returned to my father's hermitage. My father
        then asked me to get married, saying that the Grihasthashrama is the
        greatest of all the four Ashramas. I felt strongly that marriage is a
        bondage and that it takes one away from liberation. I was not convinced
        by all the reasons given by my father in favour of marriage. He then
        asked me to approach you and get my doubts cleared. I have come in
        obedience to his words. O king, kindly tell me what is the means to
        liberation-- austerity, performance of yajnas, etc., or knowledge&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span><o:p>
        </o:p>

        </span>Janaka said: &quot;I shall tell you what an aspirant for
        liberation should do. After being invested with the sacred thread, he
        should go to a Guru and study the Vedas. After completing his studies
        and having given Gurudakshina, he should enter the stage of the
        householder by getting married. He should then perform the rites laid
        down in the Vedas without attachment. He should be truthful,
        compassionate and free from all desires and cultivate purity of mind and
        body. He should also beget progeny. He need remain with his family only
        till his first-born son gets married. Thereafter he may enter the
        Vanaprastha Ashrama. After conquering the six internal enemies, namely,
        desire, anger, greed, delusion, pride and envy, he may take Sannyasa. It
        should be noted that Sannyasa is only for those who have attained total
        detachment. Out of the 48 Samskaras laid down in the scriptures, 40 are
        for householders and the remaining 8 are for Sannyasis&quot;. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Suka asked: &quot;For a person who has attained Jnana, Vijnana
        and Vairagya, is it compulsory to go through all the four Ashramas one
        after another? Can he not go straightaway to the Sannyasa Ashrama from
        Brahmacharya?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Janaka: &quot;O young sage! understand that the senses are very
        powerful. They cannot be relied upon. Disaster may befall the immature.
        If a person who is not yet fit takes Sannyasa and if thereafter desire
        for food, wealth, children or other comforts arises in his mind, what is
        the way out for him? Since vasanas will not get extinguished by
        themselves, a wise man should first eradicate them before taking
        Sannyasa. The impact of a fall is greater for a person who is at a
        height. A person at the lowest level cannot fall; he can only go up. A
        person who wants to climb up has to be very careful. If a Sannyasi
        falls, there is no remedy for him. The senses cannot be subdued by
        force. To attain complete control over the senses one should go through
        the Ashramas, one by one. A man of wisdom will not be affected by the
        pairs of opposites such as heat and cold, honour and dishonour, or gain
        and loss, even if he is a householder. Look at me. I rule the kingdom, I
        perform all my duties, I eat what I want and experience everything. At
        the same time, am I not liberated? You can also be like that. Bondage
        and liberation are both in the mind. If the mind is impure, nothing will
        be achieved by bathing in all the sacred rivers. If the mind is
        controlled, there can be no talk of bondage or liberation. It is only
        the mind that makes distinctions such as friend and foe, and the
        like&quot;. <o:p>

        </span>Suka: &quot;You say that the rituals laid down in the Karmakanda
        of the Vedas should be performed meticulously. But how can the cruel
        deed of sacrifice of animals be the means to liberation? Is not the
        drinking of soma juice in a sacrifice clearly contrary to Dharma? Are
        not killing of animals and eating their flesh unrighteous acts?
        Moreover, all that can be attained through these Vedic rituals is
        enjoyment of the pleasures of heaven for a limited period. They cannot
        confer liberation. Heaven is only a chain made of gold, which can bind a
        man as effectively as an iron chain. My mind is not at all attracted by
        such transient pleasures, which ultimately lead only to sorrow&quot;. <o:p>

        </span>&quot; O wise young sage! You have not yet understood these
        matters correctly. You have been looking only at the external appearance
        of things. That way you get only superficial knowledge. You have to go
        deeper to understand subtle truths. It is not the outward appearance
        that decides what is righteous and what is not. This is the secret of
        Karma. The same action may amount to injury to a living creature in one
        situation, but not so in another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">The
        Vedas declare that the killing of an animal in a Vedic sacrifice is not
        violence. If it is done without attachment and craving for the fruit, it
        is not violence, but even that would become violence if there is
        attachment and desire for the fruit. Any action done without attachment
        and without the sense of doership is no action at all and it does not
        create any bondage. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><o:p>

        &quot;What you say may be true in the case of a person who is free from
        desire. But how can one who is under the control of Maya become free
        from desire? When even those who have mastered the scriptures are not
        free from attachment and aversion, what to speak of the ordinary man?
        Mere study of the scriptures will not destroy nescience (ignorance of
        the Self). Can darkness be removed by merely shouting 'light, light'?
        You said, &quot;Look at me&quot;. I have looked at you carefully. I do
        not find you to be in any way different from other worldly men. I see
        you only as a king possessed of wealth, fame, power and all objects of
        enjoyment. Notions of friend and foe, happiness and sorrow, likes and
        dislikes-- you have all these as much as anyone else. And you call
        yourself Videha (meaning Jivanmukta). This is nothing but vanity. It is
        like an illiterate fool bearing the name 'Vidyadhara', a blind man being
        named 'Divakara' (which means sun) or a beggar having the name 'Lakshmidhara'.
        The name 'Videha' given to you is as meaningless as these. It is only a
        title that you have inherited from your ancestors who got it somehow,
        without any reason to justify it. Whatever that may be, as far as I am
        concerned, I am not at all interested in home, wife, children or wealth.
        I wish to remain free from all such bondage&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </span>Janaka replied: &quot;O sage, you think you can be free from all
        bondage if you go and dwell in the forest. Remember that there are
        animals there also and you can develop likes and dislikes towards them.
        The same five elements which are here are present in the forest also.
        How can you be free from any connection with them? As long as you have a
        body, you will need food. The thought about food will be with you even
        in the forest. Can you become free from thoughts about your yogadanda
        (staff), your deer-skin and your water pot? The thoughts I have about my
        kingdom are also only of the same nature. It is not the quantity or
        quality of what one has that makes for bondage, but it is the sense of
        possession. A renunciate attached to his loincloth is not less in
        bondage than a king attached to his kingdom. It is the thought that this
        body is yours that is the fundamental bondage. Being free from all sense
        of possession and knowing that I am not bound, I remain happy all the
        time, whatever I do. You, on the contrary, are always sad, thinking that
        you are in bondage. Giving up this wrong notion, know that you are never
        in bondage and that you are ever free and be at peace with yourself. If
        you understand this truth, you will realise that a man fully engaged in
        action can still be completely liberated&quot;. <o:p>

        hearing these words of Janaka, Suka realised that bondage does not arise
        from action, that none can remain without performing any action and that
        it is one's attitude towards action that creates the distinction between
        bondage and liberation. He took leave of Janaka and returned to his
        father's hermitage. He married Peevaree, the daughter of the manes. He
        begot four sons and a daughter. Thereafter he left for Kailasa and did

        </span>Many of us have studied the Upanishads and the Bhagavadgita and
        acquired an intellectual understanding of their teachings. We know
        intellectually that we are not the body or the mind or the intellect,
        that we are in reality the self or Atma which is beyond these and which
        gives consciousness to the body, mind and intellect and enables them to
        function. We know that the joys and sorrows arising from our contact
        with the external world pertain only to the body, mind and intellect and
        not to the self which cannot be touched by them. But we also know that
        this intellectual understanding is not enough and that unless this
        matures into actual experience we cannot say that we have attained the
        ultimate goal of human life. The goal to be attained is a state in which
        we remain absolutely unaffected by joys and sorrows, pleasure and pain,
        success and failure and all such pairs of opposites. What is it that
        prevents our intellectual knowledge from becoming translated into actual
        experience? We can find out the answer to this question by taking two
        examples, one in which an intellectual understanding gets translated
        into actual experience and another in which it does not. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>A person is given a dish which he has never tasted before and he
        is told that it is a very sweet dish. He now has an intellectual
        understanding about the nature of the dish, namely, that it is very
        sweet, but he has not actually experienced the sweetness. He puts a bit
        of it on his tongue and actually experiences its sweetness. Here his
        intellectual understanding has been translated into actual experience
        and the two are fully in accord with each other. But suppose this person
        is, at this time, suffering from some illness which makes everything
        taste bitter in his mouth. Even if he is fully convinced that the dish
        must be sweet as he has been told by the person who gave it to him, he
        is not able to experience that sweetness, but he experiences only a
        bitter taste. His illness obstructs his intellectual knowledge from
        being translated into actual experience. <o:p>

        </span>We can take another example. There are persons in our country in
        some of the interior States who have never seen the sea. Take one such
        person who has read everything about the sea in books. He knows that the
        sea is a very vast stretch of water, that waves constantly rise and fall
        in it, that one cannot see the other shore, and so on. When he actually
        goes to some place on the sea coast, he experiences all that he has
        learnt from books. But suppose this person is taken blindfolded to the
        sea. Then he will not be able to experience what he has learnt from
        books. The bandage on his eyes prevents his intellectual knowledge from
        becoming an actual experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </span>In the same way there is some obstruction because of which our
        intellectual understanding acquired from the scriptures<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>does not mature into actual experience. The obstruction is the
        mind which is full of desires and is therefore all the time going out
        into the external world through the sense-organs. If this obstruction is
        removed, we will be able to experience what we know intellectually. The
        means by which this obstruction can be removed and the actual experience
        of what is taught in the Upanishads, which is what is known as Self-realisation,
        can be attained are described in the Bhagavadgita. <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The Lord says in the Gita that knowledge is enveloped by
        ignorance and therefore all living beings are deluded (Ch.5.15). When it
        is said that A envelops B, it clearly follows that both A and B are
        positive entities and they exist at the same place at the same time.
        That means that both knowledge and ignorance exist in us at the same
        time. This would appear to be opposed to reason if we understand
        'ignorance' as meaning merely 'absence of knowledge'. But in Vedanta
        ignorance or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Avidya </i>or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ajnaana</i> is not
        mere absence of knowledge; it is of the nature of a positive entity,
        described as 'Bhaavarupa', as opposed to 'Abhaava' which is a mere
        negation or non-existence. Knowledge here does not mean 'knowledge of an
        object'. It means Brahman or Atman, which is of the nature of Knowledge
        or Pure Consciousness. This Atman, which is our own essence, does not
        become manifest to us because of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ajnaana
        </i>which covers it, just as on a very cloudy day the sun, being hidden
        by the clouds, is not visible to us. Actually, what is covered by the
        clouds is not the sun, which is much bigger than the clouds, but our
        vision. Similarly, when it is said that ignorance covers the Atman, what
        is meant is that ignorance covers our mental vision and prevents us from
        experiencing that we are the Atman or Brahman and not the body-mind
        complex. If this ignorance or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ajnaana
        </i>is removed, the Atman will shine forth in all its splendour (Gita,
        5.16). What has therefore to be done is only the removal of ignorance
        and not the production of knowledge, which is eternally present and
        which is our very essence, or our real nature. The mind functions
        through the sense-organs. The Kathopanishad says that the sense-organs
        are all directed outward and so they are incapable of knowing the Atman
        which is within. A rare person, having acquired total detachment,
        withdraws all his senses from their objects and concentrates the mind on
        the Atman and thus realises that he is the Atman and not the body, mind
        or intellect (Kath.up.II.1.i). This is Self-realisation. By this means
        the obstruction caused by the mind id removed. This is known in Vedanta
        as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">manonaasa </i>or destruction of
        the mind. But what is destroyed is not the mind itself, but its tendency
        to go out through the sense-organs and experience objects and feel
        attachment towards those that are pleasant and aversion towards those
        that are unpleasant. This attachment and aversion, which find place in
        every individual, are the actual obstructions to Self-realisation. As
        the Gita says, each sense-organ has either attachment or aversion
        towards its objects. Attachment and aversion are the enemies who block a
        person's path to liberation. One should therefore take care to see that
        he does not fall a victim to them, by rooting them out (3.34).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

        </span>A very apt illustration in this regard is found in Vedanta texts.
        When a potter makes a pot, he does not have to make any special effort
        to fill it with space. But if one fills the pot with water, there will
        be no space inside the pot. In other words, the space becomes covered by
        water. If the water is poured out, the pot becomes filled with space
        again. If you want to fill the pot with any other substance, say, rice,
        you have to make an effort, but if you again want the pot to have only
        space inside, all that you have to do is to remove whatever other
        substance is inside it. In the same way, Atma is ever existent in the
        mind, like space in the pot, but it is covered by all other thoughts.
        When the mind is emptied of all other thoughts, the Atma will shine
        forth. This is what is called Self-realisation. The following passage in
        the 'Jivanmuktiviveka' of Swami Vidyaranya makes this very clear:--<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>&quot;A pot of clay, when made, comes filled with the
        all-pervading space; thereafter, filling it up with water, rice or any
        other substance is due to human effort. Though the water, etc., in the
        pot can be taken out, the space inside cannot be removed; it continues
        to be there even if the mouth of the pot be hermetically sealed. In the
        same way, the mind, in the act of being born, comes into existence full
        of the all-pervading Self that is pure Consciousness itself (Atma-chaitanya).
        The mind takes on after its birth, owing to the influence of merit and
        demerit, the forms of pleasure, pain and other such transformations.
        While these can be removed from the mind, the form of the Self, which
        does not depend on any external cause, cannot be removed&quot;. It is
        therefore said:- &quot;One should cause the mind, which by its very
        nature is ever prone to assume the form of either the Self or the
        not-Self, to throw into the background its perceptions of the not-Self,
        by taking the form of the Self alone&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        </span>To the common run of people the practice of Bhakti means nothing
        more than going to the temple regularly or worshipping God by means of
        rituals in an image or other symbol at home. The persons who do this
        consider themselves to be Bhaktas and are considered so by others also.
        While such regular worship is certainly necessary and should be
        practised by every one, the Bhagavata Purana says that much more is
        expected of one who wants to be considered a devotee in the true sense
        of the term. Sage Kapila, an incarnation of the Lord, explains in the
        third Skandha of Srimad Bhagavata who a real devotee is. He says that a
        man who worships God in an image, but looks upon other human beings with
        contempt and exploits them, makes a mockery of worship, unmindful of the
        fact that the same God dwells in them also. The Lord will not be pleased
        even though worshipped in an image by means of rituals with costly
        materials, by a person who does not see the same God in all beings. The
        worship of God through rituals laid down in the scriptures is no doubt
        an essential ingredient of Bhakti, but it is not an end in itself. It is
        only the means to the realization of the presence of the same divinity
        in all beings. A person who exploits others or treats them with contempt
        and has no consideration for their feelings and rights cannot qualify as
        a Bhakta even if he assiduously performs ritual worship meticulously
        every day. This is the gist of verses 21 to 25 of chapter 29 of Skandha
        III of Bhagavata. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Now let us see what the great sage Narada says about Bhakti.
        Narada says in Narada Bhakti sutra that Bhakti is supreme love of God.
        Here it must be clarified that God is not some Being residing somewhere
        in the heavens who stands apart from the world, but God is the
        Indwelling Self of all living beings in this world. Thus love of God
        means love of all creatures, who are all His manifestations. Narada
        further says that an essential characteristic of Bhakti is the
        dedication of all activities to God. Thus what is described as Karmayoga
        in the Bhagavadgita is also an essential ingredient of Bhakti according
        to Narada. A Bhakta is thus one who does not separate religious and
        secular activities, but considers all of them as service of God. The
        Lord says in the Gita (18.46) that the performance of one's duties is
        itself worship of God and is the means to spiritual progress. A person
        who looks upon every action, whether religious or secular, as worship of
        God will act without selfishness and will not harm others in any way.
        Narada declares that the highest exemplars of Bhakti are <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>the Gopikas, who dedicated all their actions to Lord Krishna
        and whose minds were always engrossed in the thought of Krishna. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The Bhagavata, in Skandha XI, chapter 2, verses 45 to 47 divides
        devotees into three categories according to the progress achieved by
        them in the path of devotion. The highest category, called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bhaagavatottama,</i>
        is: &quot;He who sees himself in all creatures and all creatures in his
        own self&quot;. That is to say, he realizes that the same Self pervades
        the whole universe and he therefore looks upon all creatures in the
        world as God. He does not see any difference between himself and others.
        Thus the foremost devotee is also a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jnaani,
        </i>one who has ceased to identify himself with his limited personality.<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
        </i><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The second category of devotees is: &quot;He who cherishes love
        for the Lord, is friendly towards other devotees, compassionate towards
        the ignorant and does not harbour any enmity even towards those inimical
        to him&quot;. Such a person has not yet got over the sense of difference
        between himself and others, but has progressed to the extent of being
        free from pride, arrogance and hatred.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The last category of devotees is: &quot;He who worships the Lord
        with faith in an image, but does not serve His devotees or other
        beings&quot;. Even such a person is far superior to the pseudo-Bhakta
        referred to earlier, because, while the former has faith in God and
        considers worship as his duty, the latter looks upon God merely as a
        means for the fulfilment of his selfish desires. The latter does not
        deserve to be called a Bhakta at all. Prahlada says in the Bhagavata
        that a person who worships God expecting some worldly benefit in return
        is not a devotee at all, but only a trader (Bh. VII. 10.4). <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>In Sivanandalahari Sri Sankara defines Bhakti as that state of
        mind in which all thoughts are directed only towards the lotus feet of
        the Lord, just as the seed of the Ankola tree sticks to the tree itself
        on falling down, the iron needle jumps towards the magnet, the devoted
        wife thinks always of her husband, the creeper clings to a tree and the
        river keeps flowing towards the ocean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>At the highest level, Bhakti and Jnana are the same. This becomes
        clear if we compare the descriptions given of a Sthitaprajna in chapter
        2 and a Bhakta in chapter 12 of the Gita, which are identical in
        essence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The paths of Bhakti and Jnaana are not independent of each other.
        True Bhakti presupposes knowledge of the relationship between God and
        the world. Without this knowledge Bhakti will be nothing more than blind
        belief in some superhuman power called God, who blesses those who
        worship him and punishes those who do not. Such blind belief will
        crumble at the advent of the slightest adversity, because the person
        will feel that he has been let down by God on whom he had relied. But if
        he has some knowledge of the teachings of Vedanta, he will realise that
        sufferings are not inflicted on him arbitrarily by God, but are the
        result of his own past actions and that they are intended to cleanse his
        heart of impurities and engender in him an attitude of detachment
        towards worldly joys and sorrows. So also, if the path of Jnaana is
        followed without an element of Bhakti, it will become dry logic and the
        person will be devoid of love and compassion for other living beings.
        The upanishads themselves say that the Self cannot be realised by mere
        scholarship. The upanishads declare that ignorance of our true nature is
        the root cause of all our sufferings. Because of this ignorance, which
        is called Avidya, we identify ourselves with the body, the sense organs
        and the mind and attribute to ourselves the joys and sorrows which
        pertain only to the body and mind. In reality we are the Self or Atma
        which has no birth or death, hunger or thirst, sorrow or delusion, old
        age or disease. The wrong identification with the body, mind and senses
        is what is known as bondage. This bondage is not real, but is the result
        of Avidya or the ignorance of our real nature. What is caused by
        ignorance can be removed only by right knowledge. One point stressed by
        Advaita is that even when we look upon ourselves as individuals limited
        by the body, we are in reality none other than Brahman. It is not as if
        every one is initially in bondage and becomes liberated on the dawn of
        Self-knowledge. Liberation is only the removal of the wrong
        identification with the body and mind and not the attainment of some
        thing which did not exist earlier. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Now a doubt may arise. Since liberation is attained only by
        Self-knowledge, what is the purpose served by Bhakti? The upanishads say
        that the mind is the cause of bondage as well as of liberation. It is
        like the key which locks as well as opens a door. When the mind is
        attached to sense objects it causes bondage. When it becomes free from
        such attachment, the very same mind is the means to liberation.
        Self-knowledge can arise only in a mind that has become free from all
        desires for worldly objects and enjoyments and is one-pointed. It is the
        nature of the mind to hanker after sense pleasures. The mind can be
        withdrawn from them only by attaching it to something else. This is the
        role played by Bhakti. As devotion to God takes root in the mind and
        grows, desires for worldly objects become gradually weaker and finally
        disappear. The Lord says in Srimad Bhagavata that, unlike attachment to
        worldly objects, attachment to God does not cause bondage, just as a
        burnt seed cannot germinate, though its appearance as a seed continues (Bh.
        X. 22. 26).<o:p>

        </span>It is said in Srimad Bhagavata that devotion to God gives rise to
        detachment and leads to Self-knowledge (I.2.7). In the Bhagavadgita the
        Lord says that a devotee is one whose mind is always fixed on Him, who
        has surrendered himself totally to Him, who always recounts His glories
        and who ever revels in Him. The Lord confers on such a devotee the yoga
        of wisdom through which the devotee can attain to Him. The Lord dwells
        in his heart and dispels the darkness born of ignorance (Ch 10. sl. 9 to
        11). <o:p>

        </span>Madhusudana Saraswati, the great devotee and Advaitin and a
        celebrated commentator on the Bhagavadgita says in the introduction to
        his commentary that Bhakti pervades both Karmayoga and Jnaanayoga. He
        describes Bhakti as threefold-- Bhakti combined with Karma, Bhakti by
        itself, and Bhakti combined with Jnaana. Karmayoga involves the
        dedication of the fruit of all activities to God. This necessarily
        implies devotion to God. Bhakti is thus an essential ingredient of
        Karmayoga. Jnaanayoga leads to the realisation of one's identity with
        Brahman. Identification is possible only when there is intense love. A
        husband and wife identify themselves with each other and with their
        children only because of love. Devotion, which is defined by sage Narada
        as supreme love of God, is thus an essential ingredient of Jnaanayoga
        also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>All teachers of Advaita have therefore stressed the importance of
        practising both devotion and Knowledge together. Sri Sankara, the
        greatest exponent of Advaita and the greatest of Jnaanis, composed many
        soul-stirring hymns in praise of various deities in order that the
        emotional side of the human being may also be developed. It is therefore
        clear that there is no contradiction between Advaita and devotion to a
        Personal God (Saguna Brahman) as wrongly thought by some. It has been
        categorically declared that worship of Saguna Brahman is the best means
        to the realisation of Nirguna Brahman. <o:p>

        </span>It is said in Srimad Bhagavatam that the Lord, in His incarnation
        as Sri Krishna, graced the earth for 125 years (Bh. XI. 6.25). During
        this period Krishna took on many different roles, as Gopijanavallabha or
        the darling of the Gopis, as the slayer of many Asuras, as the messenger
        of the Pandavas to the Kauravas, as Arjuna's charioteer and as the
        Gitacharya, the exponent of the essence of the upanishads in the form of
        the Bhagavadgita. The most enchanting and significant of all these roles
        are those of the Gitacharya and the Gopijanavallabha. According to Swami
        Vivekananda, the Gopijanavallabha is even greater than the Gitacharya,
        because it is in that role that His infinite compassion and love are
        manifested to the fullest extent. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The word 'gopijana' should not be understood as encompassing only
        the female inhabitants of Gokula. Every sincere devotee who surrenders
        himself or herself totally to the Lord is included in the term 'gopijana'.
        Swami Vivekananda says: &quot;Gopileela is the acme of the religion of
        love, in which individuality vanishes and there is communion. It is in
        this leela that Sri Krishna shows what He teaches in the Bhagavadgita--
        &quot;Give up everything for Me. Go and take shelter under
        Brindavanleela to understand Bhakti&quot;. Krishna, as the
        Gopijanavallabha, demonstrates to us by His own example and that of the
        gopis how we can actually translate into practice the teachings of the
        Gita. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Krishna's relationship with the gopis is very much misunderstood
        and consequently misinterpreted. To quote Swami Vivekananda again:
        &quot;There are not wanting fools, even in the midst of us, who cannot
        understand the marvellous significance of that most marvellous of all
        episodes. These are, let me repeat, impure fools, even born of our
        blood, who try to shrink from that as if from something impure. To them
        I have only one thing to say, 'First make yourselves pure'; and you must
        remember that he who tells the history of the love of the gopis is one
        who was born pure, the eternally pure Suka, the son of Vyasa. So long as
        there is selfishness in the heart, so long is love of God impossible.
        Ay, forget first the love for gold and name and fame and for this little
        temporary world of ours. Then, only then, you will understand the love
        of the gopis, too holy to be attempted without giving up everything, too
        sacred to be understood until the soul has become perfectly pure. People
        with ideas of sex and money, and of fame, bubbling up every minute in
        the heart, daring to criticise and understand the love of the gopis!
        This is the very essence of the Krishna incarnation&quot;. (Sages of
        India).<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The central teaching of the Gita is that we should give up our
        ego and perform all actions as an offering to the Lord, without any
        attachment to the fruit thereof. This is what was practised by the
        gopikas. Sri Narayana Bhattatiri says in Srimannarayaniyam, a condensed
        version of Srimad Bhagavatam:-- &quot;While performing their household
        chores, the gopikas used to sing songs about Thee; all conversation
        among themselves was only about Thee; even in dream they would talk only
        about Thee. Almost all their actions were imitations of Thine. Seeing
        everything there thus identified with Thee, Uddhava was absolutely
        wonder-struck&quot; (Srimannarayaniyam 76.8).<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The gopikas had completed effaced their individuality and had
        identified themselves with Krishna. The butter which they lovingly
        offered to Krishna represents their heart. Butter is white and soft.
        Whiteness stands for purity. The implication of the offering of butter
        is that the gopikas surrendered their hearts, which were absolutely pure
        and soft, always melting in love for Krishna, to Krishna Himself. Sri
        Sankara says in Sivanandalahari that the only offering we can make to
        the supreme, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent Lord is our
        hearts:--&quot;Thou holdest the golden mountain (Meru) in Thy hand (as a
        bow); Kubera, the Lord of wealth, is ever by Thy side; the wish-yielding
        tree, Kalpakavriksha, the Kamadhenu and the gem which fulfils all
        desires, Chintamani, are all in Thy abode; the moon has its abode on Thy
        head; all auspiciousness abides at Thy feet. When this is so, what
        object of value can I offer unto Thee! Therefore, O Lord, let my mind be
        Thine (as that is the only thing I can dedicate to Thee)&quot; (Sivanandalahari,
        27). <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The great sage Narada extols the devotion of the gopikas in the
        Narada Bhakti sutras. Narada defines Bhakti as 'supreme love of God'.
        Love of God becomes supreme only when (1) it is totally free from any
        selfish desire, (2) there is no place whatsoever for any love of a
        worldly nature in the mind, and (3) the devotee completely forgets
        himself or herself and sees only the object of his love, God,
        everywhere. All these are found in the love of the gopikas for Krishna.
        Narada says further in sutras 19 to 24:--<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">Sutra
        19</span></u><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">:--
        &quot;The essential characteristics of Bhakti are the dedication of all
        activities to God and the feeling of extreme anguish if He is ever
        forgotten&quot;. Dedication of all actions to God, which is known as
        Karmayoga in the Gita, is thus an essential ingredient of Bhakti
        according to Narada. This, again, is what the gopikas were doing. Apart
        from representing their heart, butter has another significance too. It
        is the final product of all the labours of the gopikas. They milk their
        cows, turn the milk into curd, churn the curd and get butter. This
        butter, which is the essence of milk and which is the final product, is
        offered by them to Krishna. The anguish which the gopikas feel when they
        are separated from Krishna even for a very short period finds expression
        in the beautiful 'Gopikagitam' in chapter 31 of Skandha X of Srimad
        Bhagavatam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        </span>It is made very clear in the Gopikagitam in Srimad Bhagavatam

        If they did not have this knowledge, their love would have been nothing

        In such profane love the mistress is not at all interested in the
        happiness of her paramour. Such a love is purely selfish. But in the
        love of the gopikas there was no selfishness at all. <o:p>
        </o:p>

        </span>Thus Narada considers the gopikas to be the best exemplars of
        supreme devotion, or parabhakti.<o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>

        </span>The gopikas practised Karmayoga by dedicating all their actions
        to Krishna. They had intense devotion to Krishna. They knew that the
        same supreme Being indwells all creatures and is the witness of all
        their actions. Thus we see in the gopikas the synthesis of all the three
        yogas, which is the essence of the Bhagavadgita.<span style="mso-spacerun:

        </span>According to Advaita Vedanta Brahman is the only Reality. This
        Brahman appears to us as the universe of multifarious names and forms
        because of our ignorance of Brahman, in the same way as a rope, when not
        recognised as such due to dim light, appears as a snake. This ignorance
        is also known by the names 'Nescience' and 'Maya'. In his commentary on
        the Kathopanishad Sri Sankara says: &quot;Alas, how unfathomable,
        inscrutable, and variegated is this Maya, that every creature, though in
        reality identical with the supreme Being and even when taught so, does
        not grasp that fact and does not recognise himself as the supreme Self,
        while, even without being told, he accepts as his Self<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>the not-Self, namely, the aggregate of body and senses and
        thinks, 'I am the son of so and so', though these (the body, senses,
        etc.) are only objects (of perception, etc.) like pots, etc. Verily it
        is that they are being deluded by the Maya of the supreme Being, such
        that every one moves again and again (through the unending cycle of
        birth and death)&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

        </span>In Vivekachudamani, verse 108, Sri Sankara points out that Maya
        cannot be known directly, but can only be inferred from its effects,
        namely, the world of names and forms which we perceive. It is the power
        of the supreme Being. In verse 109 it is said that Maya cannot be
        described as either existent or non-existent or both; it is
        indescribable (anirvachaniya). <o:p>

        </span>In Mayapanchakam, a work consisting of five stanzas, Sri Sankara
        brings out succinctly how Maya makes incompatibles appear together and
        shows how it brings about what appears logically to be impossible. <o:p>

        different from one another only because of the limiting adjuncts.
        Intrinsically, there is neither difference nor identity among them, for
        all the three are in essence Pure Consciousness, homogeneous like a lump
        of salt. When the unconditioned Self has, as the limiting adjuncts, the
        body and organs which are characterized by ignorance, desire and action,
        it is called the transmigrating individual soul. When the limiting
        adjunct is the power of eternal and unlimited knowledge, which is Maya,
        the same Self is known as God<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">,</i>

        </span>Every human being has desires, but the desires vary from person
        to person and from time to time for the same person. Some desire wealth,
        some fame, some power; one who has no children wants children, a
        bachelor wants to get married, and so on. But if these persons are asked
        why they desire all these, the answer will invariably be that they
        expect to get happiness by the fulfilment of their desires. So it is
        clear that what every human being wants is happiness, and each one has
        his own notion of what will bring him or her that happiness. Thus it is
        happiness alone that is desired for its own sake, and everything else is
        desired only for the sake of happiness. In Vedanta all objects of desire
        are denoted by the word 'Vishaya'. This noun is derived from the verbal
        root 'si' with prefix 'vi' which means 'to bind'. This very derivation
        indicates that it is these objects of desire that bind a human being
        firmly to transmigratory existence characterised by repeated births and
        deaths. The happiness experienced on the attainment of any object of
        desire is known as 'Vishayananda'. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>'Brahmananda' is the bliss which is the very nature of the person
        who has realised that he is Brahman. This realisation is the consequence
        of the removal of the wrong identification with the body, and mind,
        which is natural to every living creature. Brahman being Bliss itself,
        one who has realised that he is Brahman remains as that very Bliss.
        Though Bliss is the real nature of every human being, it is only the
        realised soul who is aware of it. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>All desires spring from identification with the body and mind,
        because the happiness looked forward to by the fulfilment of desires is
        to be enjoyed by the body and the mind. Thus Vishayananda, or the
        happiness arising from objects, has, as its basis, identification with
        the body and mind. On the other hand, Brahmananda is the consequence of
        the removal of this identification. These two thus appear to be
        diametrically opposed to each other. However, paradoxically, as it may
        seem, Swami Vidyaranya says in Panchadasi (XV.1) that Vishayananda is
        the door to Brahmananda and is an aspect of it. We shall see how this is
        so. <o:p>

        </span></b><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">When
        a person intensely desires something, his mind remains obsessed by that
        desire. He is full of anxiety about the fulfilment of that desire and
        fears about obstacles cropping up. In such a state of mental agitation
        he is very miserable. If he fails in his effort he becomes even more
        unhappy. His mind becomes filled with anger and hatred against those
        whom he considers, rightly or wrongly, to have been responsible for his
        failure. He becomes dejected and despondent. There cannot be even the
        slightest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>trace of
        happiness when the mind is in such a state. <o:p>
        </o:p>

        </span>If, on the other hand, the object desired is attained, then his
        mind becomes calm and remains so until another desire arises to disturb
        it. When the mind is calm, the bliss which is the real nature of every
        human being, becomes clearly reflected in it, just as the moon is
        clearly reflected in a pond in which the water is clear and not
        disturbed by the wind. When the mind is agitated by anxieties, fears and
        other such emotions, the reflection of bliss is indistinct like the
        reflection of the moon in a pond in which the water is muddy or
        disturbed by wind. Thus happiness is the result of the calming of the
        mind for the time being, but it is wrongly attributed to the attainment
        of the desired object. <o:p>

        have no capacity to produce happiness or unhappiness. The same object
        may give happiness to one person and unhappiness to another person. It
        is also every one's experience that the same object gives happiness at
        one time and unhappiness at another time to the same person. Warm
        clothing gives comfort in cold weather, but one cannot bear even the
        touch of it in a hot summer. <o:p>

        </span>A person is happy when other living beings or inanimate objects
        are favourable to him, and unhappy when they are unfavourable. A thing
        or person is considered favourable when that thing or person responds in
        the way desired. If a son obeys his father, the father is happy; if he
        does not, the father is unhappy. A person is happy with his car or any
        other object as long as it functions well; if it does not, he is unhappy
        and wants to get rid of it. It is thus clear that happiness and
        unhappiness are only states of the mind, but are wrongly thought to be
        caused by external objects. Happiness is the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>result of the mind becoming calm. The mind becomes calm
        temporarily when a particular desire is fulfilled, and then happiness is
        experienced. But soon another desire crops up and agitates the mind,
        causing unhappiness. Thus it is clear that lasting happiness cannot be
        attained by the fulfilment of desires. <o:p>

        </span>True and lasting happiness can result only if the mind is
        permanently kept calm. This can be achieved only if desires, which are
        the cause of mental agitation, are completely eliminated. We are
        therefore led to the conclusion that total detachment towards all
        worldly pleasures (Vairagya) is the only means for the attainment of
        true and lasting happiness, which is Brahmananda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

        </span>Vairagya is the most essential requisite for a person who wishes
        to attain Self-knowledge, which alone will lead to eternal bliss. It is
        said by Sri Sankara that one who attempts to attain Self-knowledge
        without cultivating dispassion is like a person trying to cross a river
        on the back of a crocodile, mistaking it for a floating log of wood. He
        is sure to be eaten up by the crocodile midway. <o:p>

        </span>It is now clear why Swami Vidyaranya says that Vishayananda is
        the door to, and an aspect of Brahmananda. Vishayananda is nothing but
        Brahmananda reflected in a calm mind. <o:p>

        the bliss aspect of Brahman is reflected only in a calm mind<o:p>

        </span>Brahman is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. The existence aspect
        alone is manifested in inanimate objects, but not consciousness and
        bliss. This is because inanimate objects have no subtle body which alone
        can reflect consciousness and bliss. The consciousness aspect is
        manifested in all animate beings, even when the mind is agitated, for we
        see that even a person who is unhappy is conscious. But the bliss aspect
        is manifested only when the mind is calm. A doubt arises as to why, when
        Brahman has both the aspects of consciousness and bliss, only one of
        them, consciousness, is reflected in an agitated mind. When you look at
        the reflection of your face in a mirror, you find that the face in its
        entirety is reflected and not only some aspects of it. This doubt is
        answered by Swami Vidyaranya by giving two examples. When water is in
        contact with fire, only the heat aspect of fire is absorbed by the water
        and not the light of fire. But when a log of wood comes into contact
        with fire, it absorbs both the heat and the light aspects. The same is
        the case with the reflection of Brahman. <o:p>
