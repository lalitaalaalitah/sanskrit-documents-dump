</span>Sri Sankara Bhagavatpada has blessed the world with an enormous legacy of
invaluable gems. These can be grouped under three broad categories. The first
category, meant for the intellectually most advanced, comprises his commentaries
(bhaashya) on the Upanishads, Brahmasutras and the Bhagavadgita, known
collectively as the prasthaanatrayam. The second category consists of
independent works, known as prakarana granthas, which expound the gist of the
upanishads in simple language. These vary in length from half a verse to one
thousand verses. In the third category fall devotional hymns addressed to
various deities. Through these devotional hymns also the teachings of Vedanta
are conveyed. There is a wrong impression among some persons, particularly
Western scholars, that Sri Sankara did not attach importance to devotion to a
personal God. On the basis of this view they conclude that the devotional hymns
cannot be works of Sri Sankara. This view is belied by Sri Sankara’s own
statements in his commentaries, which are accepted by all to be his works. For
example, in his commentary on the Gita, 2.39, he explains Krishna's words to
Arjuna thus-&quot;You will become free from bondage by the attainment of
knowledge through God's grace&quot;. Again, in 18.65-&quot;Knowing for certain
that liberation is the definite result of devotion to God, one should be intent
only on surrender to God&quot;. Moreover,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sri
Sankara is well known for having re-established the worship of the supreme
God-head in His six aspects, and is referred to as the Shanmatasthapaka.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Unlike the Sankhyas who gave importance only to the Jnaanakaanda and the
Purva Mimamsakas who dismissed the Upanishads as mere arthavada or eulogy,
Sankara established in his bhaashyas that both the kaandas have validity, though
at different stages of the aspirant’s spiritual progress. In his bhaashya on
Br. Up. 4.4.2 he says-“All the obligatory rites serve as means to liberation
through the attainment of Self-knowledge. Hence we see that the ultimate purpose
of the two parts of the Vedas, that dealing with rites and that dealing with
Self-knowledge, is the same”. In many places in the Karma kanda there are
clear indications that the ultimate goal of life is liberation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What is Advaita Vedanta? Dr. T.M.P.Mahadevan says in his book ‘Ramana
Maharshi and His Philosophy of Existence’—“We believe that Advaita is not
a sectarian doctrine. It is the culmination of all doctrines, the crown of all
views. Though other views may imagine themselves to be opposed to Advaita,
Advaita is opposed to none. As Gaudapada, a pre-Sankara teacher of Advaita,
says, Advaita has no quarrel with any system of philosophy. While the
pluralistic world-views may be in conflict with one another, Advaita is not
opposed to any of them. It recognizes the measure of truth that there is in each
of them; but only, that truth is not the whole. Hostility arises out of partial
vision. When the whole truth is realized, there can be no hostility. (Mandukya
Karika, III. 17 &amp; 18; IV. 5)”.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font size="4">The core of Advaita is that Brahman is the only
reality. ‘Reality’ is defined as that which does not undergo any change at
any time. By this test, Brahman, which is absolutely changeless and eternal, is
alone real. The world keeps on changing all the time and so it cannot be
considered as real. At the same time, we cannot dismiss it as unreal, because it
is actually experienced by us. The example of a rope being mistaken for a snake
in dim light is used to explain this. The snake so seen produces the same
reaction, such as fear and trembling of the limbs, as a real snake would. It
cannot therefore be said to be totally unreal. At the same time, on examination
with the help of a lamp it is found that the snake never existed and that the
rope alone was there all the time. The snake cannot be described as both real
and unreal, because these two contradictory qualities cannot exist in the same
entity. It must therefore be said that the snake is neither real nor unreal.
Just as the snake appears because of ignorance of the fact that there is only a
rope, this world appears to exist because of our ignorance of Brahman. Thus the
world is also neither real nor unreal; it is ‘mithya’ or ‘anirvachaniya’,
meaning ‘indescribable’. Just as the snake is superimposed on the rope, the
world is superimposed on Brahman. Our ignorance of Brahman is what is called
avidya or ajnana or nescience. This nescience has two powers, the power to
conceal the reality, known as aavaranasakti and the power to project the unreal,
known as vikshepasakti. Because of these two powers, nescience not only covers
Brahman, but it further projects the universe and makes it appear real. The
world has no reality apart from Brahman, just as the snake has no reality apart
from the rope. When the knowledge of Brahman arises, the world is seen as a mere
appearance of Brahman. Another example may be taken to explain this. Ornaments
of different sizes and shapes are made out of one gold bar. Their appearance and
the use for which they are meant vary, but the fact that they are all really
only gold, in spite of the different appearances and uses, cannot be denied. The
appearance may change, a bangle may be converted into rings, but the gold always
remains as gold. Similarly, on the dawn of the knowledge of Brahman<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(which is the same as the Self), though the different forms continue to
be seen by the Jnaani, he sees them all only as appearances of the one Brahman.
Thus the perception of difference and the consequences of such perception, such
as looking upon some as favourable and others as the opposite, and the
consequent efforts to retain or get what is favourable and to get rid of or
avoid what is not favourable, come to an end. This is the state of liberation
even while living, which is known as Jivanmukti.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Jiva, or individual, is none but Brahman, but because of
identification with the body, mind and senses he looks upon himself as different
from Brahman and as a limited being, subject to joys and sorrows caused by
external factors. This identification with the body, mind and senses is what is
called bondage. In reality the Jiva is the pure Brahman and is different from
the body-mind complex. When this truth is realized as an actual experience, the
identification with the body-mind complex ceases. This is liberation. Thus
liberation is not the attainment of a state which did not exist previously, but
only the realization of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>what one
has always been. The illusory snake never existed. What existed even when the
snake was seen was only the rope. Similarly, bondage has no real existence at
all. Even when we are ignorant of Brahman and think of ourselves as limited by
the body, we are really none but the infinite Brahman. Liberation is thus only
the removal of the wrong identification with the body, mind and senses. The
attainment of the state of liberation-in-life or Jivanmukti is the goal of human
life according to the Upanishads.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The method followed in Vedanta to explain the nature of Brahman is known
as ‘superimposition and denial’ (adhyaaropa and apavaada). Only an object
that has a quality or an activity or a relationship with some other known object
can be described by words. Brahman is devoid of all these and so it cannot be
described directly. The world, with which we are familiar, is therefore taken as
the starting point and we are gradually led from the known to the unknown and
unknowable that is Brahman. It cannot be known because it can never be
objectified. It is the eternal subject in whose mere presence the body, mind and
the sense organs function. It is pure consciousness and it is the reflection of
this consciousness that makes the body, mind and senses appear to be conscious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The world is called prapancha because it has five characteristics,
namely, existence (asti), manifestation (bhaati), lovability (priyam), name (naama),
and form (roopa). Of these, the last two are different for each entity or
object. They are always subject to change and are the products of maaya. The
unenlightened person looks upon this aggregate of five characteristics as the
world. The first three constitute the essential nature of Brahman (or the Self)
which is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. The enlightened person knows that this
Brahman is the only reality and that the world is only an appearance on this
Brahman which is the substratum. The Upanishads speak of Brahman as the cause of
the world, but this is only to enable us to understand the ultimate truth that
the world has no reality. Sri Sankara makes this clear in his bhaashya on
Br.up.2.1.20 : “Therefore, the mention in all the Vedanta texts of the origin,
sustenance and dissolution of the universe is only to strengthen our idea of
Brahman being a homogeneous entity, and not to tell us that the origin, etc, is
real. Nor is it reasonable to suppose that a part of the indivisible,
transcendental Supreme Self becomes the relative, individual self, because the
Supreme Self is intrinsically without parts”. This is the method of
superimposition and subsequent denial. Ultimately the nature of Brahman as the
only reality is brought out by the famous words in the Br.Up, ‘neti, neti’,
(‘not this, not this’). When the whole universe, which is only a projection
by nescience, is negated what remains is the eternal, immutable, non-dual
Brahman.</font></p>

</span>Vivekachudamani is a prakarana grantha. It consists of 581 verses. It is not divided into chapters
or sections. It is in the form of a dialogue between an ardent seeker and his
Guru. The fundamental principle in Vedanta is that its teachings should be
imparted only to those who sincerely seek it and approach a Guru with deference
and faith. In this work the Guru proceeds step by step, answering the doubts of
the disciple with patience until at the end the disciple attains realization. <o:p>
