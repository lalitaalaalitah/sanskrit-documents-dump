        insentient. The subtle body takes up another gross body. This process

        the subtle body as its limiting adjunct, move between this and the next
        world, as between the waking and dream states, through birth and death,
        consisting respectively in the association with and dissociation from
        the (gross) body. It should be noted here that, when the subtle body,
        which has the vital force as its chief constituent, and which is
        illumined by the self-luminous <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

        person is gasping for breath. Although this is an occurrence that is
        commonly observed, the upanishad mentions it only to stimulate a spirit
        of renunciation in us. Since at the time of death a man is in a helpless
        state of mind and cannot adopt the means for attaining the final goal of
        life, he must practise the means earlier, when he is in a position to do

        withdraws the subtle body, including the vital force (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">praaNa)

        that this subtle body has similarly gone from one gross body to another
        many times before, just as it has moved frequently between the dream and
        waking states. It goes to the particular gross body determined by the

        his means for the realization of the results of his actions. Therefore
        the whole universe, impelled by his work, waits for him with the
        requisite means for the realization of the results of his actions. The
        S’atapatha Brahmana says-“A man is born into the body that has been
        made for him” (VI.II.ii.27). This process is illustrated by two

        It has been said in 4.3.36 –“This infinite being, completely
        detaching himself from the parts of the body”—In order to explain
        when and how that detachment takes place, the process of transmigration
        is described in detail in this section--- S<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">a
        ayam aatmaa sammuuDha ayamiti--- </i>When the self becomes weak---
        really it is the body that becomes weak, but its weakness is
        figuratively spoken of as that of the self. The state of helplessness at
        the time of death, which is caused by the withdrawal of the organs, is
        attributed by the ordinary man to the self. At this time the organs,
        such as that of speech, come to the self. Then this self that is in the
        body is detached from the parts of the body. How does this detachment
        take place and how do the organs come to the self? This is being
        explained: Completely withdrawing these particles of light, i.e. the
        organs, such as the eye, so called because they reveal colour etc. The
        word ‘completely ‘ shows the distinction of this state from sleep,
        in which they are just drawn in, but not absolutely, as in this case.
        The self then comes to the heart, i.e. the ether in the lotus of the
        heart; in other words, the consciousness is manifested in the heart. The
        self cannot, by itself, move or withdraw the activities of the organs.
        It is through the limiting adjuncts, such as the intellect, that all
        changes and activities are attributed to the self. When does it withdraw
        the particles of light? The answer is: the presiding deity of the eye,
        who is an aspect of the sun, being directed by the individual’s past
        actions, goes on helping the functioning of the eye, but withdraws this
        help and becomes merged in the sun when the person is about to die.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Br.up.3.2.13 says that the vocal organ merges in fire, the vital
        force in air, the eye in the sun, and so on, at the time of death. These
        organs again take up their respective places when the individual takes
        another body. <o:p>

        consumption after reaching that world, and what are the materials for
        making the new body and organs? The answer is: the self, journeying to
        the next world, is accompanied by all the knowledge acquired, the result
        of all actions (karma) and the impressions of past actions. These
        impressions are the cause of the initiation of fresh actions and the
        bringing to fruition of past actions. When the organs are prompted to
        work by the impressions of past actions, they can easily attain skill in
        certain spheres even without any practice in the present life. It is
        observed that some persons are skillful in certain activities, such as
        painting, from their very birth, even without any training in the
        present life (child prodigies). This is due to skill attained in past
        lives. Similarly, in the enjoyment of sense objects also, some are found
        to be skillful by nature and others are not. Hence it is said that these
        three—knowledge, work and past experience—are the food on the way to
        the next world (or next life) and after reaching there (i.e. taking a
        new body). Therefore one should cultivate only the good forms of these

        </span>presiding deities), since the new body is made in accordance with
        the person’s work, knowledge and past impressions, the functions of

        knowledge and work, stretch out, like a leach, from the body, retaining
        their seat in the heart, as in the dream state, and build another body
        in accordance with his past work; they leave their seat, the old body,
        when a new <a name="_Hlt37997559"></a>body is made ready. An

        the old leaf and onto the new leaf, so also, the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jiiva</i>
        takes hold of the new body and only thereafter leaves the old body. This
        is similar to what happens when going from the waking to the dream
        state. In the dream state the person identifies himself with his dream
        body and completely dissociates himself from his waking state body. The
        presiding deities of all the organs also take their places in the new
        body. The nature of the new body, whether it is that of a human being or
        of a god, or of an animal or other creature, depends on the past karma,
        knowledge and impressions (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vaasanas)</i>

        objects of desire, thinking highly of them, is born along with those
        desires in a situation in which he will be able to realize those
        desires”(3.2.2). Desire is therefore the cause of repeated births and
