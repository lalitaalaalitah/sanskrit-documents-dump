        </span>Sri Vidyaranya Swami flourished in the fourteenth century A.D. He
        was the Guru as well as the Prime Minister of Harihara I and Bukka, the
        founders of the Vijayanagara Kingdom. He is reputed to the greatest
        among post-Sankara Advaitins. He was the head of the Sringeri Sarada
        Pitha established by Sri Adi Sankara Bhagavatpada from 1377 to 1386 A.D.
        Panchadasi is one of the works attributed to him. This work is so named
        because it consists of fifteen chapters. It is a comprehensive manual of
        Advaita Vedanta. The fundamental teachings of Advaita are presented in
        this work in a clear and lucid manner. It is therefore the best text for
        the novice who desires to get acquainted with this philosophy. At the
        same time the work is very profound and is of interest to advanced
        students of Advaita as well. <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The fifteen chapters of this work are divided into three groups
        of five chapters each. Brahman or the supreme Self, which is the only
        reality according to Advaita, is described in the Upanishads as
        Existence-Consciousness-Bliss. The first group of five chapters deals
        with the Existence aspect of Brahman, the second group with the
        Consciousness aspect and the third with the Bliss aspect. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;</span>The core of Advaita is that Brahman is the only reality.
        'Reality' is defined as that which does not undergo any change at any
        time. By this test, Brahman, which is absolutely changeless and eternal,
        is alone real. The world keeps on changing all the time and so it cannot
        be considered as real. At the same time, we cannot dismiss it as unreal,
        because it is actually experienced by us. The example of a rope being
        mistaken for a snake in dim light is used to explain this. The snake so
        seen produces the same reaction, such as fear and trembling of the
        limbs, as a real snake would. It cannot therefore be said to be totally
        unreal. At the same time, on examination with the help of a lamp it is
        found that the snake never existed and that the rope alone was there all
        the time. The snake cannot be described as both real and unreal, because
        these two contradictory qualities cannot exist in the same substance. It
        must therefore be said that the snake is neither real nor unreal. Such
        an object is described as 'mithya'. Just as the snake appears because of
        ignorance of the fact that there is only a rope, this world appears to
        exist because of our ignorance of Brahman. Thus the world is also
        neither real nor unreal; it is also 'mithya'. Just as the snake is
        superimposed on the rope, the world is superimposed on Brahman. Our
        ignorance of Brahman is what is called Avidya or Ajnana or Nescience.
        This ignorance not only covers Brahman, but it projects the world as a
        reality. The world has no reality apart from Brahman, just as the snake
        has no reality apart from the rope. When the knowledge of Brahman
        arises, the world is seen as a mere appearance of Brahman. Another
        example may be taken to explain this. Ornaments of different sizes and
        shapes are made out of one gold bar. Their appearance and the use for
        which they are meant vary, but the fact that they are all really only
        gold, in spite of the different appearances and uses, cannot be denied.
        The appearance may change, a bangle may be converted into rings, but the
        gold always remains as gold. Similarly, on the dawn of the knowledge of
        Brahman (which is the same as the Self), though the different forms of
        human beings, animals, etc., continue to be seen by the Jnani, he sees
        them all only as appearances of the one Brahman. Thus the perception of
        difference and the consequences of such perception, such as looking upon
        some as favourable and others as the opposite, and the consequent
        efforts to retain or get what is favourable and to get rid of or avoid
        what is not favourable, come to an end. This is the state of liberation
        even while living, which is known as Jivanmukti. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>The Jiva, or individual, is Brahman itself, but because of
        identification with the body, mind and senses he looks upon himself as
        different from Brahman and as a limited being, subject to joys and
        sorrows caused by external factors. This identification with the body,
        mind and senses is what is called bondage. In reality the Jiva is the
        pure Brahman and is different from the body-mind complex. When this
        truth is realized as an actual experience, the identification with the
        body-mind complex ceases. This is liberation. Thus liberation is not the
        attainment of a state which did not exist previously, but only the
        realization of what one has always been. The illusory snake never
        existed. What existed even when the snake was seen was only the rope.
        Similarly, bondage has no real existence at all. Even when we are
        ignorant of Brahman and think of ourselves as limited by the body, we
        are really none but the infinite Brahman. Liberation is thus only the
        removal of the wrong identification with the body, mind and senses. The
        attainment of the state of liberation-in-life or Jivanmukti is the goal
        of human life according to the Upanishads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>Maya, which is also known by other names such as Prakriti, Avidya
        and Nescience, is what conceals Brahman and projects the universe. It is
        because of this that every one identifies himself with his body-mind
        complex and is ignorant of the truth that he is none other than Brahman.
        Sri Vidyaranya points out that Maya may be looked upon from three
        different standpoints. For the ordinary worldly individual who looks
        upon the world as real, Maya which is the cause of the appearance of the
        world is real. For the enlightened person who has realized his identity
        with Brahman, Maya does not exist at all. For the person who attempts to
        understand Maya through reasoning, Maya is indeterminable because it
        cannot be described as either real or unreal or both. <o:p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>There is a wrong notion that according to Advaita the world is a
        mere illusion. What Advaita says is that the world is not real in the
        sense in which Brahman is real. Advaita accepts three orders of reality.
        Brahman, which is eternal and changeless, is the absolute reality, known
        in Vedanta as paaramaarthika satyam. The world has empirical reality,
        known as vyaavahaarika satyam, which means that as long as a person has
        not become free from avidya and has not realized his real nature as
        Brahman, the world is real for him. It is on this basis that all the
        rituals, injunctions and prohibitions laid down in the Vedas become
        applicable to such a person. In other words, until a person realizes
        that he is not the body or mind or senses but Brahman, the world is real
        for him. The object of Vedanta is to make man give up his wrong
        identification with the body and realize his true nature. What is meant
        here is not mere intellectual knowledge, but actual experience, which is
        otherwise known as realization. <o:p>
        </o:p>
        </font></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </span>The third order of reality consists of such cases as a rope
        appearing as a snake, a piece of nacre being mistaken for silver, and
        the experiences in dream. This order of reality is known as
        praatibhaasika satyam. <o:p>
        </o:p>
