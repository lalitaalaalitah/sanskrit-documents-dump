</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">While the Pandavas were
living in the forest, one day Bhima roamed about enjoying the magnificent
natural scenery all around. Suddenly he found himself in the grip of a huge
python which had coiled itself around his body. In spite of his tremendous
strength Bhima was not able to extricate himself from the grip of the python.</font></h1>
<h1 style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">Just then Yudhishthira,
who had set out in search of his brother,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>happened
to reach that spot and was horrified to see Bhima’s plight. He pleaded with
the python to release Bhima, offering to get some other prey for it, but the
python refused.</font></h1>
<h1 style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">The python then told
Yudhishthira that it was, in its previous life, none other than Nahusha, an
ancestor of Yudhishthira. He had become a python as the result of a curse on him
by sage Agastya because in his overbearing haughtiness born of wealth and power
he had insulted some Brahamanas.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></font></h1>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun:

Yudhishthira was able to give proper answers to some questions that it would put
to him.</font></p>

statement that the truth that is worth knowing is free from joy and sorrow, I
think there is no state which is free from these two.</font></p>

</i>If the qualities such as truthfulness which I have mentioned are found in a
Sudra and are not found in a Brahmana, that Sudra is not a Sudra and that
Brahmana is not a Brahmana. O Python! That person should be considered a
Brahmana in whom the qualities such as truthfulness exist and he who does not
have such qualities should be considered a Sudra.</font></p>

regards your statement that there is no state that is beyond joy and sorrow,
that is no doubt correct as far as anything that is attainable by action (karma)
is concerned. But just as water can never by nature be hot and fire can never by
nature be cold, that truth which is attained by the removal of ignorance and is
realized as non-different from oneself can never be touched by the joys and
sorrows of this world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

who is a Brahmana, then birth loses significance in the case of a person whose

a child is born certain sacraments are performed. Till the sacraments are
performed and the boy is taught the Vedas he is only like a Sudra. Swayambhuva

even after the performance of sacraments and the study of the Vedas, the boy has
not acquired good qualities and conduct, then it means that that there is strong
admixture of castes in him. This is what has been decided after careful thought.
I have already said that a Brahmana is one in whom good qualities and conduct
have blossomed after the performance of sacraments.</font></p>

heaven. If his actions and conduct are to the contrary, he will be born as an
