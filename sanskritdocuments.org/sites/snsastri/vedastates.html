        dream and then the waking state, proving that it is distinct from all
        these three states. To explain this further, an illustration is given
        here. Just as a big fish in a river moves freely from one bank to the
        other, never affected by the currents of the river, so does this
        infinite being move to both the states of dream and waking. The point of
        this illustration is that the body and organs, which are described as
