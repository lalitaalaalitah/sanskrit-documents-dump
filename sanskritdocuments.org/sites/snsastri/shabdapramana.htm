<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">shabda or verbal testimony is one of
the six pramANas recognized by advaita vedAnta. This is dealt with in chapter IV
of vedAntaparibhAshA (VP).</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">In the nyAya school shabda is defined
thus: AptavAkyam shabdaH—Verbal testimony is the statement of a trustworthy
person.<br>
Verbal testimony is of two kinds—laukikam (secular) and vaidikam (scriptural).
Verbal testimony can be in the form of spoken or written words. This is adopted
in vedAnta also.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>statement of a person
becomes trustworthy if he is free from such defects as delusion, incorrect
knowledge, intention to deceive, etc. In the case of statements in the vedas
such defects are impossible because the vedas are apaurusheya, that is, they are
not the composition of any person. The question of reliability arises only in
respect of statements made by human beings.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">The chapter on verbal testimony in VP
starts with the statement--- atha Agamo nirUpyate, which means—Now verbal
testimony is being discussed. The word ‘Agama’ means ‘authentic word’,
and also the vedas. This word thus covers both secular and scriptural
statements.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">Apart from being the words of a
trustworthy person (which condition is automatically satisfied in the case of
statements from the vedas), the next condition laid own for a statement to be a
means of valid knowledge (pramANa) is that it should not be contradicted by any
other means of knowledge, such as perception, inference, etc. In respect of
secular statements it is easy to determine whether this condition is satisfied
or not. Even if, at the time the secular statement is heard or read there was no
knowledge of its being contradicted, it is possible that subsequently a
knowledge arises through any of the other pramANas which shows that the
knowledge conveyed by the secular statement was wrong. In such a circumstance
the knowledge from the secular statement, which was till then considered to be
valid, would become invalid.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">In the case of statements from the
vedas, which include the upanishads, the question arises as to how the knowledge
from such a statement could ever be contradicted by any other pramANa such as
perception. This can be understood if we remember that our ancients have clearly
demarcated the spheres of authority of the veda on the one hand and all the
other means of knowledge on the other. In matters that cannot be known except
from the vedas, such as what yajna should be performed for fulfillment of a
particular desire, how it should be performed, etc., the only authority is the
vedas. Even though our perception shows that the world is real, the upanishads
say that it is not the truth from the absolute point of view. In such matters
also the upanishads supercede perception because perception is not competent to
dislodge the assertion of the upanishads. The upanishads are not of human origin
(being apaurusheya), and so there is no possibility of any defect in them,
unlike in perception.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">As regards matters which fall clearly
within the scope of perception Shri Shankara says in his bhAshya on br. up.
3.3.1:--</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">“Nor are the Srutis supposed to have
authority in matters that are contradicted by other means of knowledge, as, for
instance, if they said, ‘Fire is cold and wets things’. If, however, a
passage is ascertained (by the application of the six tests, namely, beginning
and conclusion, repetition, originality, result, eulogy and demonstration) to
have the meaning given by the Srutis, then the evidence of the other means of
knowledge must be held to be fallacious”.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">It is through verbal statements,
spoken as well as written, that knowledge is transmitted. The scope of verbal
testimony is much wider than that of the other means of knowledge. Through
perception we can know only what is here and now. Inference, etc., also have
their own limitations. But it is through verbal testimony in the form of books,
newspapers and other records that we come to know what has happened in the past
and what is happening elsewhere at the present time. This is why this means of
knowledge has been analysed at great length in works of the nyAya school as well
as in VP.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">Sruti is the ultimate pramANa. It is
the pramANa which leads to the highest purushArtha, namely, liberation. Once a
person has attained liberation with the help of Sruti, then Sruti itself ceases
to be pramANa for him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">The conditions necessary for a
sentence to convey its meaning and the various ways in which the meanings of
words are to be understood are dealt with in detail in VP. These apply to both
secular and scriptural statements.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">According to VP there are four
conditions that determine the mutual relation between the words of a sentence.
These are, expectancy, consistency, contiguity, and the knowledge of the
purport. This is a theoretical analysis which may not be of interest to many
persons. However, having taken up the task of preparing a summary of the chapter
on verbal testimony I cannot completely leave it out. I shall therefore explain
each of these very briefly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">1. Expectancy- When a person
hears a word which signifies some action, there arises in his mind<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>expectancy about the subject of the action, the object, the place, time,
etc. Similarly when a noun, say, table, is mentioned, the hearer expects the
speaker to give further details about it, such as “I have bought a new
table”, etc. A sentence is complete only if it fulfills such expectations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">2. Consistency- This means
that the objects or ideas denoted by the words in a sentence should not be
mutually contradictory. A sentence such as “He is wetting the place by
sprinkling fire” is an example. If a sentence in which there is such a
contradiction appears, it means that the real meaning is something different
from the literal meaning and that the sentence has a deeper significance than
what appears. One example given is the sentence, “Thou art That”. Here the
literal meanings of the words ‘Thou’ and ‘That’ are the individual and
Isvara respectively. These two have totally contradictory characteristics and so
they cannot be equated. Therefore the implied meanings have to be taken. How
this is to be done will be explained later on when that topic comes up.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">3. Contiguity- As a person
hears or reads a sentence he understands the meaning of each word. The words
should follow one another in such a manner that the sense of the whole sentence
can be understood. If some word is omitted it will have to be supplied to get
the meaning. In the vedas instances of such omissions occur. One example from
the karma kANDa has been given in VP. The missing word to be added is known from
the context. The justification for adding such words is the need for contiguity.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">4. Knowledge of the purport (tAtparya)-
This may also be stated as the intention of the speaker. This is a matter of
common experience. Some words have more than one meaning. Which meaning is to be
adopted depends on the context, which determines the intention of the speaker.
The Samskrit word ‘saindhava’ means ‘horse’ as well as ‘salt’. When
a person who is eating asks some one attending on him to bring saindhava, the
word clearly means salt. But when a person is ready to go riding and asks his
servant to bring saindhava it is clear that he means a horse. In the scriptures
there are places where the purport is to be taken in preference to the literal
meaning. That is how this condition is important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The meanings of words are of two kinds, primary (shakti) and implied (lakshya).</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="4">The primary meaning
of a word is its literal meaning. The word ‘cow’ means the animal known by
that name. According to advaita vedAnta, the word ‘cow’ means the species
cow and not any particular cow. Some of the other schools such as nyAya, however
hold that a word means only a particular entity and not the species. This is not
accepted by advaita. When the word ‘cow’ is mentioned, we think of the cow
in general and not of any particular cow. The species is known as ‘jAti’ and
an individual of the species is known as ‘vyakti’. When a person hears the
word ‘cow’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it is the common
characteristics of all cows that come to mind. When a cow is pointed out to a
child and he is told that it is a cow it is the particular characteristics of a
cow that he remembers and that is why he is able to recognize another cow which
he sees elsewhere, even if it is of a different colour or size. Thus each word
directly denotes the ‘jAti’ and only indirectly the particular ‘vyakti’
which is referred to.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">The uninitiated may think that all
this discussion about whether a word denotes the species or an individual is
mere hair-splitting without any practical utility. To them it must be pointed
out that Shri Shankara has found this theory useful for refuting the contention
of an opponent in his bhAshya on brahmasUtra 1.3.28. He says there, “Words are
connected with the general characteristics and not with the individuals, for the
individuals are infinite, and it is impossible to comprehend the relation of a
word (with all of them)”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The primary meaning of a word is known as ‘vAcyArtha’.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">It may happen that in a particular
sentence the literal meaning of a word does not give rise to the intended sense
of the sentence as a whole. In such cases the literal meaning of the word is
discarded and an implied meaning is adopted. Such an implied meaning is known as
‘lakshyArtha’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and the
implication is known as ‘lakshaNa’. There are three kinds of implication.
These are:--</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left"><font face="Arial" size="4">1.
jahal-lakshaNa—exclusive implication.<br>
2. ajahal-lakshaNa—inclusive implication.<br>
3. jahad-ajahal-lakshaNa- quasi-implication or exclusive-inclusive implication.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">The third type of implication is used
for explaining the meaning of the mahAvAkya “Tat tvam asi”. This will be
explained later on.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">These three kinds of implication will
now be explained.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">1. Exclusive implication—In
this the literal meaning of the word is discarded, but a connected meaning,
which makes the sentence meaningful, is adopted. The classic example is the
sentence: “There is a cowherds’ colony on the (river) Ganga”. Obviously
the colony cannot be in the water of the river. So the word ‘Ganga’ has to
be understood as meaning ‘bank of Ganga’. The use of this kind of
implication is common in practice. For example, the city of Frankfurt in Germany
is always referred to as ‘Frankfurt am Main’<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>which means ‘Frankfurt on the (river) Main’. We have to understand
this as ‘the banks of the river’. When we say “India won the match” it
does not mean the country as a whole, but the Indian team.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Arial" size="4">The second kind of implication
is now taken up.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">2. Inclusive implication. In
this the primary meaning is retained and an additional meaning is implied. The
classic example is, “The red runs”. The meaning is, “The red horse
runs”, where ‘red’ is retained and ‘horse’ is added from the context.
This is also common in practice. One example-A hawker selling plantains is going
along my street, pushing a cart containing plantains. I call him by shouting,
“Eh, plantain, come here”. What I mean is that the plantain-seller should
come along with his cart of plantains. So the word ‘plantain’ is retained
and ‘plantain-seller’ is added by implication.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial" size="4">3. Quasi-implication. Here
the primary meanings of the words of a sentence are partly included and partly
excluded. The classic example for this is the sentence, “This is that
Devadatta”. Here ‘this’ refers to the person in front now and ‘that’
refers to the same person seen at some other time in some other place. The
identity of ‘this’ and ‘that’ is to be understood by discarding the
person’s connection with the past time and place on the one hand and the
present time and place on the other. This implication is also known by the name
bhAgatyAgalakshaNa since one part of each of the items is discarded.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">This is the kind of implication that
is applied for interpreting the mahAvAkya “Tat tvam asi”. The manner in
which this is done is explained below.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">The
word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tat </i>stands for brahman as
qualified by the functions of creation, sustenance and dissolution, i.e.,
Ishvara or saguNa brahman. nirguNa brahman is beyond the reach of words and so
no word can denote it by its primary meaning. A word can convey through its
primary signification only that sense which has one of the following
characteristics—generic attribute (jAti), quality, activity or relationship
with some other word. nirguNa brahman has none of these. The word <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tvam
</i>stands for the AtmA as qualified by the mental states of waking, dream and
deep sleep, i.e., jIva. These two are of mutually opposed qualities, like the
glow-worm and the sun, like the servant and the king, like the well and the
ocean and like the atom and the earth (verse 244 of vivekacUDAmaNi). There can
be no identity between these two, which are the literal meanings (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vAchya-artha)
</i>of the words <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tat </i>and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tvam.
</i>The identity is only between their implied meanings (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lakshya-artha).
</i>The opposition between the literal meanings is due to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">upAdhis,</i> since the literal meaning of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">tat </i>is Brahman with the<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> upAdhi
</i>or limiting adjunct of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mAyA </i>and
the literal meaning of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tvam </i>is AtmA
with the limiting adjunct of the five sheaths. When these limiting adjuncts,
which are not real, are effectively removed, there is neither <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Ishvara</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> </i>nor <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">jIva</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">.
</i>The two terms <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">tat </i>and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tvam </i>(That and
Thou) are to be understood properly by their implied meanings in order to grasp
the import of the absolute identity between them. This is to be done neither by
to<a name="_Hlt459122501"></a>tal rejection of their literal meaning nor by
total non-rejection, but by a combination of both.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The meaning of the sentence <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tat
tvam asi </i>is obtained by using this method. Just as in the sentence “This
is that Devadatta” the identity is stated by rejecting the contradictory
qualities, so also in the sentence “That thou art” the contradictory
qualities<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>are rejected. Thus it
follows that the jIva<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>and Brahman are
in essence one when the limiting adjuncts, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">mAyA</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
</i>and the five sheaths, are rejected. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoHeading7"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></font><font face="Arial" size="4">In
addition to the primary and implied senses described above, there is another
kind of meaning known as gauNa or secondary. This s found in such expressions
as, “ Ranjit Singh was known as the lion of Punjab”. Here the qualities of a
lion such as courage, majesty, etc., are attributed to a person. Other examples
are, “He is a moving encyclopaedia”, “He is a fire-brand”.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoHeading7"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There are sentences in the karma kANDa of the vedas which are known as
‘arthavAda’. These convey either praise or censure. They become meaningful
only when they are connected with sentences containing an injunction. One
example is the statement. “He cried” in the taittirIya samhitA. There is a
rather funny story behind this. Once, when the gods went to fight a war, they
entrusted their valuables to the deity agni for safe custody. When the gods came
back and asked for the return of the valuables, agni ran away with them. The
gods chased him and caught him. Then agni began to cry. His tears became silver.
Therefore, if<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a person performing a
sacrifice gives silver as dakshiNa to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
priests, some cause will arise for weeping in the sacrificer’s family within a
year. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">This arthavAda is to be
connected with injunctions regarding sacrifices. The object is to say that
silver should not be given as dakshiNa, but only gold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The pUrvamImAmsakas contend that the statements in the jnAna kANDa of the
vedas, which do not lay down any injunctions should be considered as arthavAdas.
Shri Shankara refutes this contention in his brahmasUtra bhAshya on the ground
that the mere statement about brahman gives rise to knowledge that leads to
liberation and so such statements are not mere arthavAdas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Arial" size="4">How the vedas are held to be authoritative:</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">According to the nyAya school the
vedas are means of valid knowledge because they are produced by God who is
eternal and omniscient and they are paurusheya. The mImAmsakas do not accept
this view. They hold that the vedas are eternal, they were never created by any
person, human or divine and they are never subject to destruction. They are
therefore apaurusheya.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Arial" size="4">The advaitins also hold that the vedas
are apaurusheya, but their reason for this is different from that of the
mImAmsakas. According to VP the vedas are not eternal, but they have an origin,
as stated in such shruti texts as, “The Rigveda, yajurveda, sAmaveda, rtc.,
are the breath of the Infinite Reality” (Br.up. 2.4.10). At the beginning of
each cycle of creation God manifests the vedas exactly as hey were in the
previous kalpa (cycle of creation). So they are not the creation of any person.
The smRitis and the epics are composed by human beings (sages) and so they are
not apaurusheya.</font></p>
