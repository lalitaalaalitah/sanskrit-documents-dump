first requisite for a spiritual aspirant is intense detachment towards all
things that are impermanent, i.e. everything other than the Self. Then come
control of the senses, control of the mind, etc. He should give up all actions
motivated by desire for his own benefit. That means that all actions should be
performed in the spirit of karmayoga. He should hear the teachings of the sruti
from a teacher, reflect on the teachings to remove all doubts, and meditate on
them. All these should be done continuously over a long period.</font></p>

physical body is made up of seven substances; marrow, bone, fat, flesh, blood,
skin and the cuticle. All these are the products of the food and drinks
consumed. This is explained in Chandogyopanishad as follows:--</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Ch.up.6.5.1.Sankara
Bhashya (S.B) —Food, when eaten, becomes divided in three ways. The grossest
portion of the food turns into faeces. The medium constituent becomes flesh. The
subtlest part, having reached the heart, enters into the fine nerves named <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">hitaa, </i>becomes transformed into the mind-stuff and nourishes the
mind. It therefore follows that the mind is made of matter. It is not considered
as eternal and partless as held by the Vaiseshikas. (It is of the size of the
body—<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">madhyama parimaana).<o:p>
</o:p>
</i></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Ch.up.6.5.2.S.B---<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Water (or any liquid) when drunk becomes divided in three ways. The
grossest portion becomes urine. The medium constituent becomes blood. The
subtlest part becomes the vital force (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">praana).</i>
Ch.up.6.7.1 says—“The vital force is made up of water. It will depart from
him who does not drink water”. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Ch.up.6.5.3.S.B—Butter,
oil, etc, when consumed, become divided in three ways. The grossest portion
becomes bone. The medium constituent becomes marrow, the greasy substance inside
the bones. The subtlest part becomes the (subtle) organ of speech (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">vaak)</i>.
It is a well -known fact that by the consumption oil, butter and the like,
speech becomes clear and powerful. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">The
physical body is the basis of the delusion in the form of ‘I’ and
‘mine’. It is made up of various components as stated above. Just as a house
made up of various materials is meant for its owner, so also the body made up of
various components is for the atma which is the owner of the body. So the atma
is different from the body. Moreover, the body is always undergoing changes and
is impermanent and so it cannot be the atma which is changeless and eternal.</font></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">The
gross body is made up of the five gross elements. The process by which the five
subtle elements, namely, ether, air, fire, water and earth, become gross
elements is known as ‘pancheekaranam’ or quintuplication. The process is
described by Swami Vidyaranya in Panchadasi as below:-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">Panchadasi.1.26,27—The
omnipotent Lord combined the five subtle elements by the process known as ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">pancheekaranam’ </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(</span>quintuplication)
and produced gross elements to provide the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jivas
</i>(individual souls) with physical bodies and objects of enjoyment. The
process of combination of the subtle elements is this. Each subtle element is
divided into two equal parts. The second half of each such element is again
divided into four equal parts (i.e. to get one-eighth of each element). Then the
first half of each element is combined with one-eighth of each of the other four
elements to make a gross element. The result is that in a gross element of earth
one half is earth itself and the other half is made up of the elements of water,
fire, air and space in equal shares. Similarly with the other four gross
elements. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The five essences of the subtle elements, namely, sound which is the
essence of ether, touch which is the essence of air, colour which is the essence
of fire, taste which is the essence of water, and smell which is the essence of
earth, become the objects of sense which are experienced by the respective
sense-organs. Human beings who are attached to objects of senses continue to
transmigrate. As long as there is attachment to sense-objects there is no hope
whatsoever of liberation. A person who attempts to cross the ocean of
transmigratory existence without acquiring total detachment is sure to be seized
by the crocodile of desire and drowned. One who has killed the crocodile in the
form of desire for sense pleasures with the sword of detachment can alone hope
to cross the ocean of samsara without obstruction. The aspirant for liberation
should follow the teachings of his Guru and cultivate detachment. He should shun
worldly pleasures, equating them to poison. He should cultivate with great
eagerness the virtues of contentment, compassion, forbearance, honesty,
straightforwardness, calmness and self-control. He who aspires to realize the
Self while continuing to indulge in sense pleasures is like a man who tries to
cross a river on the back of a crocodile, mistaking it for a log of wood. He is
sure to be swallowed up by the crocodile midway. For the seeker of liberation
attachment to his body, wife, children, etc., is as bad as death. He alone
deserves liberation who has completely rid himself of attachment. The importance
of detachment has been stressed in a number of verses by the Acharya. In order
to create dispassion it is pointed out that the gross body is despicable because
it is made up of revolting substances such as skin, flesh, blood, blood-vessels,
fat, marrow and bones and contains within it urine and faecal matter. The gross
body is produced by one’s own karma in past lives. It is the instrument for
all worldly experiences which the jiva has to undergo. In the waking state the
gross body experiences gross objects through the sense organs. A person’s
entire contact with the external world is through the gross body. The gross body
is to the jiva what a house is to its owner. The gross body undergoes birth, old
age and death. It is qualified by stoutness, leanness, and the like. The ideas
of caste and station (varna and asrama) apply to it. It is afflicted by
diseases. It is subjected to worship, honour, dishonour, etc. <o:p>

attachment to it, the subtle body is taken up for examination. This will be
