</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">Maya is unmanifest (avyaktam).
It cannot be known through the sense-organs because it has no quality like
colour, etc. It is the power of the supreme Being. If such a power is not
accepted, the creation of the universe cannot be explained, since Brahman by
itself is devoid of any activity. It is beginningless nescience. It is
constituted of the three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas. It can only be inferred
from its effects by the wise who follow the sruti. Maya is neither real nor
unreal, nor both. An unreal thing is some thing that is never experienced, such
as the horn of a hare. Since the universe, the effect of Maya, is actually
experienced, its cause cannot be unreal like the horn of a hare. At the same
time, it cannot be real because it is sublated on the attainment of
self-realization. It cannot be both real and unreal, because these contradictory
qualities cannot exist in the same substance at the same time. It is therefore
indescribable (anirvachaniya). It is neither different nor non-different from
Brahman, nor both. It is neither composed of parts nor without parts, nor both.
If it has parts then it must have an origin, but it is without a beginning. If
it has no parts then it cannot become modified as the universe. It is most
wonderful. <o:p>

</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">Maya will cease to exist
for a particular individual when he realizes the pure non-dual Brahman, just as

</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">Maya is made up of the
three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas. There are three powers in Maya: the power
of concealing the reality (avaranasakti), the power of projecting what is not
real (vikshepasakti), and the power of jnana (jnanasakti). The first two are the
causes of bondage; the third leads to liberation. The first is the result of the
tamas part of Maya, the second is due to the rajas part and the third is due to
the sattva part. Isvara’s Maya is predominantly sattvic and it is under His
control. So there is no bondage for Him. The jiva’s Maya is constituted of all
the three gunas in different proportions and so he suffers bondage. The rajoguna
is the cause of attachment, aversion, etc., in the jiva. All qualities such as
desire, doubt, fear, courage, resolve, faith, lack of faith, anger, avarice,
pride, jealousy etc., (both good and bad qualities) relate only to the mind and
not to the atma. They are superimposed on the atma because of lack of
discrimination between the mind and the atma due to ignorance. These qualities
of the mind are the cause of all the activities of the jiva.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-align:justify"><span style="text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The veiling power of Maya belongs to its tamasic aspect. It is only
because the reality, Brahman, is concealed by it that the projecting power of
Maya is able to function and project the world and make it appear real. Thus the
veiling power of Maya is the root cause of the jiva’s bondage and
transmigration. Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati Swami says in his commentary that
even in the case of a realized person the projecting power (vikshepasakti)
continues to operate as a result of praarabdha karma. Therefore he also sees the
world as ordinary persons do, but he is not affected by any happenings, good or
bad, because his knowledge of Brahman is not veiled and so he looks upon
everything as Brahman. An example may be given to illustrate this. A child looks
at a lion made of stone and runs away screaming in fear. An adult also sees it
as a lion, but is not frightened because he knows that it is only stone. So it
is the veiling power of Maya that is the cause of all misery. <o:p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-align:justify"><span style="text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">Even a person who is
learned in the scriptures does not realize the nature of the self if he is
overpowered by tamoguna. He considers the world, which is only a superimposition
on the self due to beginningless nescience, as real. This delusion leads to
sorrow. The power of Maya to delude has been described by Sri Sankara thus in
his Bhashya on Kathopanishad, 1.3.12:- “Alas, how unfathomable, inscrutable
and variegated is this power of Maya, that every human being, though in reality
identical with the supreme Brahman, and is told this again and again by the
upanishads, does not realize that truth, but considers himself as the body, mind
and senses, even though he is not told so by any one”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-align:justify"><span style="text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The veiling power of Maya produces four obstacles to knowledge in the
mind of man. These are, (1) the notion that the identity of jiva and Brahman and
the illusoriness of the world propounded in the upanishads cannot be correct
(known as abhaavanaa), (2) the idea that the body itself is the self (viparitabhaavanaa),
(3) notions contrary to the teachings (vipratipattih), and (4) doubt (asambhavana).
The vikshepasakti of Maya which projects the world as a reality keeps the man in
bondage. <o:p>

</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">Ignorance, laziness, lack
of discrimination, torpor, indifference, delusion, and similar negative
qualities are the result of tamoguna. A person subject to these does not make
any effort to uplift himself. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-align:justify"><span style="text-decoration:

</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">Sattvaguna is very pure.
But because of admixture with rajas and tamas transmigration results. When a
person is predominantly sattvic, with only a tinge of rajas and no tamas, he is
free from pride, and practises the disciplines such as yama and niyama. Such a
person has faith, devotion, yearning for liberation, and divine qualities. He
withdraws from the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>pursuit of
worldly pleasures. ‘Yama’ has five components: non-injury, truthfulness, not
coveting other’s possessions, continence, and non-acceptance of gifts.
‘Niyama’ also has five components: purity of body and mind, contentment,
austerity, study of the scriptures, and dedication of all actions to God. <o:p>

<p class="MsoSubtitle" style="text-align:justify"><span style="text-decoration:

</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">When sattvaguna is
uncontaminated by rajas and tamas the results are alertness of mind, experience
of the self, supreme calmness, contentment, bliss, and remaining established in
the supreme bliss because of which there is everlasting bliss. <o:p>

</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">The causal body made up of
the three gunas is unmanifest. Dreamless sleep is its distinctive state. In this
state the organs and the mind do not function. The mind remains in seed form in
this state. The absence of knowledge of any kind in this state is evident from
the fact that a person who wakes up from sleep says that he did not know
anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

sense organs, the vital air, the mind, the ego-sense, all functions of these,
all the sense-objects, pleasure, pain, etc., the five elements, the entire

All this is mithya, what cannot be described as either real or unreal. These are
all the effects of Maya. On the realization of Brahman these will be found to
have no reality.<span style="mso-spacerun:
