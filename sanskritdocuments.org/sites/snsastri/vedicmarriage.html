</span>The Hindu religion, or, to use its original name, Sanaatana Dharma, lays
down a comprehensive scheme for the spiritual development of the human being.
The ultimate goal of human life is liberation from the repeated cycle of births
and deaths. All the rites laid down in the Vedas have, as their ultimate
purpose, the attainment of this goal. The essential requisite for progress
towards this goal is purity of mind. The Vedas, supplemented by the Dharma
Sastras, prescribe a series of samskaras or sacraments to be undergone by Dvijas
(Brahmanas, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas) at various stages of life. These sacraments
have, apart from their immediate objective, the effect of purifying the mind and
making the person fit for spiritual progress and ultimate liberation. Some of
the important samskaras are jaatakarma (performed immediately after the birth of
the child), </span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;;letter-spacing:
-1.0pt">naamakarana (naming ceremony),,</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;">
annapraasana (first feeding of rice), upanayana (investing with the sacred
thread) and vivaaha (marriage). Of all the sacraments marriage is the most
important. Our scriptures accord a very high place to the Grihastha or
householder. Those belonging to all the other three orders, namely,
Brahmachaaris, Vaanaprasthas and Sannyaasins, depend on the householder for
their sustenance. Manusmriti says:&quot; Just as every creature lives by air, so
the other orders of life are sustained by the householder&quot;. After
completing his studies under a guru the Brahmachaari is enjoined to enter
Grihastha-asrama in the normal course. (It is only for those very rare
individuals who have attained total detachment towards worldly affairs that
Sannyaasa directly from Brahma-charya is prescribed). One of the mantras in the
marriage ceremony says that the purpose of marriage is to beget virtuous
progeny. Only a Grihastha is entitled to perform the rituals prescribed in the
Vedas, including Sraaddha to ancestors. There is an anecdote in the Rigveda
describing the origin of the institution of marriage. A god by name Soma desired
to get married and sent the two Aswinidevas to Savita, the father of a girl
named Sooryaa, to ask for her hand. Savita agreed to give his daughter in
marriage to Soma. Then the bridegroom Soma went to Savita's house and was
received there with honours. Sooryaa was given in marriage to Soma with the god
of fire as the witness. Our marriages have been modelled on this episode from
time immemorial. There is one item in the marriage ceremony, known as
Vara-preshanam, which is reminiscent of this episode and re-enacts it by the
chanting of mantras implying the sending of two or four Brahmanas by the
prospective bridegroom to seek the consent of the father of the prospective
bride. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In our tradition, marriage is not merely bringing about the relationship
of husband and wife between a man and a woman. It is the union of two families,
who merge as one. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Marriage is considered to be the gifting of a virgin girl by her father
or guardian to a deserving boy. This gift, called Kanyaadaanam, is considered to
be the most praiseworthy of all gifts. In one of the mantras in this ceremony
the father (or whoever is giving the girl in marriage) prays to Lord Mahavishnu
that, by this gift, his own generation and ten generations before him as well as
ten generations after him may be blessed with supreme bliss in Brahmaloka. He
then worships the feet of the bridegroom, looking upon him as Mahavishnu
Himself. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In all Vedic ceremonies dakshina to the officiating priests and 'daanam'
or the gifting of cash and various useful articles to the priests and other
Brahmanas present forms an important ingredient. This should not be looked upon
as mere charity intended to benefit the recipients. The main purpose of these
gifts is to help the spiritual progress of the giver. The tendency to accumulate
wealth and cling on to it is natural in every human being. The Upanishads
declare that as long as this tendency remains in the mind, there is no hope of
spiritual progress for the individual. A hymn in the Saamaveda exhorts every one
to counter this tendency by giving freely of one's wealth to others. In the
Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad Brahma, the Creator, instructs human beings to give 'daanam'
liberally, in order that they may get rid of the defect of greed which is a
serious obstacle to spiritual progress. The Bhagavadgita says that greed is one
of the gates to hell. It is therefore in the interest of the spiritual
development of the giver that the institution of 'daanam' has been built into
every religious ceremony. Giving of gifts during ceremonies such as marriages
has thus a two-fold objective, namely to earn merit (punya) as well as to
facilitate spiritual progress towards the ultimate goal of liberation. The
importance of dakshina is brought out in the following extract from the Bhashya
(commentary) of Sri Sankaracharya on the Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad: &quot;The
yajna (sacrifice or any other Vedic ritual) rests on the dakshina to the
priests. The fruit of the Vedic rite accrues initially to the priests who
actually perform it. It has to be acquired by the yajamaana (the person for
whose benefit the ritual is meant) by paying dakshina to the priests. The
dakshina rests on faith because when a man has faith he gives dakshina to the
priests; if he has no faith, he does not give it. 'Faith' implies liberality---
faith in the Vedas coupled with devotion&quot;. There is a tendency among some
people to spend lavishly on all other items in a marriage but to economise when
it comes to dakshina and daanam. Compared to the total amount that has to be
spent on a marriage these days the amount that goes out by way of daanam and
dakshina is a very small percentage, but the result attained cannot be evaluated
in material terms. One should therefore be as liberal in giving dakshina and
daanam as he is in respect of the other items of expenditure. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The mantras chanted during the marriage ceremony were handed down to
posterity thousands of years ago by our ancient sages who 'saw' them in their
state of super-consciousness or communion with the divine. The mantras express
lofty ideas and have great spiritual potency. The vibrations set in motion by
the chanting of the mantras purify the marriage hall as well as all those
present there. The persons belonging to the bride's party and the bridegroom's
party should listen to the mantras with devotion and faith so that the maximum
benefit may be derived. The bridegroom's father, the bridegroom and the bride's
father should, when they perform the various rituals, repeat the mantras after
the priest with devotion and faith (Bhakti and Sraddha). Devotion and faith are
very important. Lord Krishna says in the Bhagavadgita that he accepts even
insignificant offerings, such as a leaf, flower, fruit or even just water, so
long as they are made with devotion. He further says that any yajna, daanam,
austerity or any other rite performed without faith does not benefit the person
either in this world or in the next. The Chaandogya Upanishad makes it clear
that chanting mantras even without knowing their meaning does confer benefit,
though the benefit will be greater if the person chanting knows the meaning
also. Marriage is not merely a joyous occasion, but, more than that, it is
essentially a religious function with great sanctity attached to it. The guests
who attend the marriage ceremony will contribute greatly to the lasting welfare
and happiness of the bride and bridegroom if they observe silence, listen to the
mantras, and keep mentally praying to God to bless the couple, instead of merely
engaging in conversation with others. Nowadays the decibel level in a marriage
hall goes up so high that the chanting of the mantras cannot be heard. We, the
educated elite, should bring about a wholesome change in this situation so that
the sanctity of the marriage ceremony may be maintained and the full benefit of
the mantras may be derived. Another point to be stressed here is that no one
should shake hands with the bride or bridegroom until the marriage ceremony is
completed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be advisable if
the invitees wait till the end of the marriage ceremony to offer their presents
to the bride and bride-groom. Those who want to leave early would do well to
hand over their presents to some other member of the family concerned instead of
interrupting the ceremony by insisting on giving them to the bride or
bride-groom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

</span>It must be pointed out here that there is no sanction whatsoever in the
scriptures for the demand or acceptance of dowry in cash or in kind. This is an
evil which has crept into the society and which deserves to be eradicated. It
will also be seen from the episode of the marriage of Soma to Sooryaa narrated
above that it is the prospective bridegroom who has to take the initiative in
searching for a bride and not the parents of the bride as has become the
practice now.<o:p>

</span>The various items in the marriage ceremony are essentially the same for
persons belonging to all the three Vedas, but there are differences in some
details, depending on the Veda to which the bridegroom belongs. These
differences will be pointed out at the appropriate places. The marriage ceremony
as performed by the Brahmin community in Tamil Nadu is what is described here.<o:p>

</span>On the afternoon of the day preceding the marriage the bridegroom's party
sets out for the marriage hall. Before starting, a puja to Lord Ganesa is
performed by the bridegroom's father. <o:p>

</span>On the evening preceding the day of the marriage, the bride and
bridegroom and the members of their families go to a temple and offer worship.
In the past the bridegroom used to be taken in a procession, but this is done
only rarely nowadays. The term 'Jaanuvaasam' puzzles most people. 'Jaanu' means,
in Sanskrit, 'knee' and 'vaasa' means 'cloth'. A Brahmachari is, according to
the Sastras, expected to wear<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>only
a single dhoti which reaches up to his knees. When he becomes a Grihastha, he
has to wear 'panchakaccham' and an upper cloth. (The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>word ‘panchakaccham’ is wrongly pronounced by most people as ‘panchgaccham’.
Kaccham means an end or hem of the dhoti and pancha means five. In this way of
wearing the dhoti, five ends are tucked in and hence the name panchakaccham).
The occasion on which he wears the single dhoti up to the knees for the last
time is known by the term 'Jaanuvaasam'. The term persists, though no one
follows these conventions about dress nowadays. <o:p>

</span>The main rite preceding the actual marriage is Samaavartanam (popularly
known as Vratham). This represents graduation on the completion of studies by
the Brahmachaari under a guru and is the prelude to the marriage. In ancient
times this was performed by the Brahmachaari while leaving the gurukulam on
completion of studies. This is done either on the morning of the day of the
marriage or on the previous morning according to convenience. The following
items form part of this rite:--<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

</span>Ankuraarpanam-- The seeds of certain grains are sown in five earthen pots
after worshipping them with mantras. Four of these pots are placed in the four
cardinal directions and the fifth in the centre. These are kept in a safe place
till the completion of the marriage ceremony. They are then immersed in water in
a temple tank or other convenient place. The idea behind this rite is the
worship of the various gods to get their blessing for the smooth conduct of the
marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pot at the centre
represents Brahma, and the other four pots represent Indra, Yama, Varuna and
Soma. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

</span>Naandi or Abhyudaya sraadham. The purpose of this is to propitiate the
ancestors. The term 'abhyudaya' stands for the first three Purusharthas, namely
Dharma, Artha and Kaama. By this rite the blessing of the manes is prayed for,
for the attainment of these Purushaarthas. It is said in Valmiki Ramayana (Balakanda,
Sarga 72, sloka 19) that king Dasaratha performed Naandi before the marriage of
Sri Rama to Sita. This rite is to be performed at the commencement of every
religious function. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

</span>Pratisarakarma- A thread dipped in turmeric powder and sanctified with
mantras is tied around the wrist of the right hand for males and the left hand
for females, with the chanting of mantras. This indicates that the person has
taken a vow to complete the religious rites undertaken with full faith and
devotion.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

</span>Snaanakarma-- Certain rituals are performed with the chanting of mantras.
The bridegroom has a shave and bath. Then he wears 'panchakaccham', and two
sacred threads (yajnopavitam). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-align:justify;text-indent:

</span>Kaasiyaatra-- The bride's father tells the bridegroom: &quot;Please do
not go to Kaasi. I shall give my daughter in marriage to you. Please accept her
hand and attain all welfare and prosperity&quot;. This function may look
comical, but there is a profound significance in it. Going to Kaasi stands for
asceticism. The bridegroom is asked to enter grihasthasrama instead of becoming
an ascetic, so that he can discharge the three debts to the gods, Rishis and
ancestors. Every one is born with these three debts. The debt to the Rishis is
discharged by the study of the Vedas, the debt to the gods by the performance of
sacrifices and the debt to the ancestors by performing Vedic rituals and
begetting a son. The last two are possible only in the grihasthasrama. <o:p>
</o:p>

</span>The bride and bridegroom exchange garlands. This symbolises the free
exchange of ideas between the two after marriage, indicating that neither of
them will keep back anything from the other. They then sit on the swing. The
swing is said to symbolise the ups and downs of life, which the couple have to
face unitedly with confidence and full faith in each other. This is an occasion
for ladies to sing songs in lilting tunes. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The actual marriage ceremony now begins. The bridegroom prays to the
assembled priests and Brahmanas and all elders to bless him and make him fit to
go through the marriage ceremony. He then performs puja to Lord Ganesa. He
chants a mantra which says that he is marrying in order to beget virtuous
progeny.<o:p>

</span>As stated earlier, this is reminiscent of the marriage of Soma and
Sooryaa. The bridegroom requests two or four of the Brahmanas present to find a
suitable bride for him from a good family. The Brahmanas request the bride's
father to give his daughter in marriage to the bridegroom for begetting virtuous
progeny. The bride's father gives his consent by saying three times, &quot;I
shall give&quot;. All this is done through appropriate mantras. Before this the
bride's father should have performed all the preliminary rites for the bride,
such as jaatakarma, etc.<o:p>

</span>The bride's father sits facing east on a raised seat. The bride sits on
his lap. The bridegroom stands facing them. The 'Pravara' (lineage) of both the
families is then recited by the father of the bride. A sample Pravara runs thus:
'&quot;To the bridegroom named Krishna Sarma, belonging to Samaveda, who is
Mahavishnu Himself, who is the great grandson of Narayana Sarma belonging to
Bharadwaja gothra, and the grandson of Mahadeva Sarma, and the son of Viswanatha
Sarma, I give my daughter named Jayalakshmi, who is the great grand daughter of
Sundaresa Sarma belonging to Kausika gothra, the grand daughter of Ramaswami
Sarma, and the daughter of Rajagopala Sarma&quot;. The mantra further says:
&quot;I being desirous of attaining Brahmaloka, give my daughter, adorned with
gold ornaments, to you, Mahavishnu. May all the gods and goddesses and all the
beings who support the universe be the witnesses. I am giving this daughter so
that my ancestors may attain salvation. May I attain moksha by gifting my
daughter to you. I give this daughter of mine to you for begetting virtuous
progeny and for performing religious rites.&quot; He then places the hands of
the bride in the hands of the bridegroom. The bridegroom clasps the right hand
of the bride and both sit down for performing the further rituals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>For this there is a rite in the marriage ceremony of Rigvedins and
Yajurvedins. As there are various wrong notions about this rite, it is described
here along with its real significance. A miniature yoke made of wood is placed
on the head of the bride. The thirumangalyam is placed near the hole in the yoke
and water is poured drop by drop through the hole on the bride. This is based on
an old story according to which sage Atri had a daughter by name Apaalaa. She
had some skin disease because of which nobody was willing to marry her. She did
penance and prayed to Indra. Indra came and poured water on her through the hole
in the yoke of his chariot. She not only became completely free from the
disease, but also lustrous like the sun. The mantras recited in this context are
taken from Apaalaa's hymns of praise in the Rigveda. This rite is not performed
when the bridegroom is a Saamavedin. Instead, the bride is purified by the
singing of some Saamaveda chants. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The bridegroom then gives a sari (Koorapudavai) to the bride. She goes
inside, wears it and comes back. The bridegroom's sister is asked to help the
bride to wear this sari. During this interval the priests should be asked to
sing hymns from the Saamaveda if the bridegroom is a Saamavedin. In Rigvedic and
Yajurvedic marriages the priests should chant Ghanam. <o:p>

</span>The thirumangalyam (or Mangalasutra) is first taken round to get the
blessings of the elders present in the marriage hall. Then the bridegroom
invokes Maangalya Devataa<span style="mso-spacerun:

upachaaras (shodasopachaara). <o:p>

</span>The bride's father sits on the raised seat, facing east. The bride sits
on his lap. The bridegroom places the thirumangalyam around the bride's neck and
ties one knot, chanting a mantra the meaning of which is as below:-- “O
auspicious damsel, I tie this auspicious thread, which ensures long life for me,
around your neck. May you live for a hundred years”. The bride-groom’s
sister then ties two knots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>

</span>The bridegroom clasps with his right palm the right palm of the bride,
including the thumb and recites mantras which mean: &quot;I take your hand so
that we may beget virtuous progeny and live till a ripe old age. The gods Bhaga,
Aryamaa, Savita, Indra and others have given you to me to be the mistress of my
house. O Goddess Saraswati, we sing your praise in the presence of all living
beings. Please confer your blessings on us. May all the gods make you (the
bride) always favourably inclined towards me. <o:p>

</span>This is the most important item in the marriage ceremony. It is only
after this that the marriage becomes complete and legally valid. The bridegroom
holds the joined palms of the bride with his left hand and with his right hand
he lifts the right foot of the bride and moves it over seven steps, chanting
mantras for each step. The mantras uttered by the bridegroom at each step mean:
&quot;O dear damsel, by the first step may<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lord Vishnu bless us with plenty of food, by the second step with bodily
strength, by the third step success in the performance of all vows, by the
fourth step happiness, by the fifth step cattle and all other wealth, by the
sixth step may all the seasons be favourable to us, by the seventh step may Lord
Vishnu bless that we may together perform all the ordained Vedic rites
successfully. By taking seven steps with me you have become my most intimate
friend and well-wisher. I shall never swerve from this relationship. God has
united us. We shall perform all our actions together with mutual love and full
faith in each other. We shall always be of one mind. We shall perform all our
religious duties together. We are complementary to each other. May we have good
progeny and prosperity&quot;. <o:p>

</span>Now the bridegroom pours oblations of ghee into the sacred fire. The
bride sits by his side, touching him with her right hand, to indicate that the
two are performing this rite together. Mantras are chanted to propitiate the
various gods, with the following prayers: &quot;May Indra bless the bride to
become attached to her husband's house and family, to beget good children and to
be prosperous. May Agni bless her children with long life. May she have
happiness from her children. May she never have to shed tears. May she be
protected on all sides by all the gods. May Varuna guard our lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>A grinding stone is kept to the west of the homakunda. The bridegroom
holds the joined palms of the bride with his left hand and, lifting the right
foot of the bride with his right hand, places it on the grinding stone, chanting
a mantra. The gist of the mantra is this: &quot;Get up on this stone. Be firm
like this stone in carrying out your vows. Resist those who oppose you (in
carrying out your vows).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do not
succumb to them.&quot; Here the stone is a symbol of firmness. There are various
wrong notions about the significance of this rite also.<o:p>

</span>The bride's brother stands to the right of the bride, facing north. The
bride's mother stands nearby, holding a vessel containing parched rice. The
bride's brother takes a handful of grains from the vessel and places it in the
palms of the bride, which are held by the bridegroom in his folded palms. The
grains are then offered into the fire in the homakunda. While offering the
grains the bridegroom chants a mantra, the purport of which is: &quot;This lady
is offering these grains as oblation into the fire, saying, 'may my husband live
for a hundred years, may my race prosper'&quot;. Parched rise is a symbol of
prosperity. Then the bridegroom holds the right hand of the bride and goes round
the fire, chanting a mantra. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Bookman Old Style&quot;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter the groom again lifts the right foot of the bride and places
it on the grinding stone as before, chanting the same mantra as before. Then
again, going back to the homakunda, parched rice is offered as oblation as
before. This is followed by going round the fire and lifting the right foot of
the bride and placing it on the grinding stone for the third time. Parched rice
is again offered into the fire. <o:p>

</span>The bride and bridegroom go to the bridegroom's house accompanied by the
members of their families. There some mantras are to be chanted by the
bridegroom. These mantras indicate the very high place that is accorded to the
daughter-in-law in the house. The mantras, addressed to the bride, say:-
&quot;Be like an empress in this house. May you be like a queen to your
father-in-law, mother-in-law, sisters-in-law and others. By your affectionate
conduct towards all those in your husband's house, may you win them over&quot;.

house by the Vedas.<span style="mso-spacerun:

</span>After the stars rise in the horizon, the bridegroom points out these
stars to the bride, chanting some mantras. Dhruva stands for firmness. It is
prayed that in their married life this couple should be as firm as Dhruva and
they should never swerve from the path of Dharma. Arundhati is the wife of Sage
Vasishta and is the symbol of chastity. The idea is that the bride should be
chaste like Arundhati.<o:p>
