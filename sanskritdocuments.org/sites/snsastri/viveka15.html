<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4">The
mahavakya “That thou art”<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4">In the
sentence ‘tat tvam asi’ the primary meaning of the word ‘tat’ is Brahman
as qualified by the functions of creation, sustenance and dissolution of the
universe, that is, Isvara. The primary meaning of the word ‘tvam’ is the
jiva as qualified by the states of waking, dream and deep sleep. The qualities
of Isvara and jiva are totally contradictory, like those of the sun and the
glow-worm, or the king and a servant, or the ocean and a well, or the earth and
an atom. Isvara is omniscient and omnipotent while the jiva’s knowledge and
power are limited. The identity affirmed by the mahavakya cannot obviously be
between Isvara and jiva which are the primary meanings of the words. Therefore
the implied meanings of the two words have to be taken. The contradiction
between the primary meanings of the two words is due to the limiting adjuncts
which are not real. Maya is the limiting adjunct (upadhi) of Isvara, while the
upadhi of the jiva is the five sheaths. When these limiting adjuncts are
negated, there is neither Isvara nor jiva. The kingdom is the symbol of the king
and the shield is the symbol of the warrior. When these are removed there is
neither king nor warrior. The sruti negates the duality imagined in Brahman. The
negation of the limiting adjuncts is to be effected by reasoning supported by
sruti. Everything in the universe is a superimposition on Brahman by ignorance
and has no reality, like the snake superimposed on a rope. The entire universe
must therefore be rejected as unreal. Then what remains is only Brahman . Thus
both Isvara and jiva are found to be only Brahman when the unreal upadhis are
rejected. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus only the implied meanings of the terms ‘tat’ and ‘tvam are to
be taken for affirming their identity. The implied meanings of words are of
three kinds—<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">jahallakshanaa, ajahal-
lakshanaa </i>and </font><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font size="4">jahadajahallakshanaa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The literal meaning is to be
rejected and some other meaning consistent with it is to be adopted. An example
is—<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">gangaayaam ghoshah, </i>the literal
meaning of which is—a hamlet on the river Ganga. Since there cannot be a
hamlet on the river itself, it is the bank of the river that is meant. Here the
literal meaning of the word ‘Ganga’ has to be given up completely and the
implied meaning ’bank’ has to be adopted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

secondary signification)--</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"> </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Without
giving up the literal meaning of the word, what is implied by it is also adopted
to get the meaning intended to be conveyed. An example is—“The red is
running”, which is intended to convey that the red horse is running. Here the
literal meaning of the word ‘red’ is retained and the implied word
‘horse’ is added to get the correct sense of the sentence. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">jahadajahallakshanaa-</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">
(exclusive—non-exclusive secondary signification)-- Here a part of the literal
meaning is retained and the other part discarded. The sentence “This is that
Devadatta” is interpreted by using this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">lakshanaa.</i>
The meaning intended to be conveyed by this sentence is that Devadatta who is
seen at the present time in this place is the same as the person who was seen
earlier in another place. The literal meaning of the word ‘this’ is
Devadatta associated with the present time and place. The literal meaning of the
word ‘that’ is Devadatta associated with the past time and some other place.
Since this sentence purports to convey the identity of the person seen in
different places at different times, we get this meaning by discarding the
reference to the place and time conveyed by the words ‘this’ and ‘that’
and retaining the reference to Devadatta. This is also known as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">bhaagatyaaga-lakshanaa. </i>The meaning of the sentence <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tat
tvam asi </i>is obtained by using this method. Just as in the sentence “This
is that Devadatta” the identity is stated by rejecting the contradictory
qualities, so also in the sentence “That thou art” the contradictory
qualities (namely, the limiting adjuncts)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>are
rejected. Thus it follows that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">jiva
</span>and Brahman are in essence one when the limiting adjuncts, namely <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Maya</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
</i>and the five sheaths, are rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
