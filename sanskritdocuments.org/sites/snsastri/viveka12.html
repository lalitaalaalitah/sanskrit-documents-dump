sheath of the intellect<o:p>

</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font size="4">The intellect (buddhi) along with the five organs
of sense, the modifications of the mind (vrittis), and the notion of agency is
known as the sheath of the intellect (vijnaanamayakosha). Because of the
reflection of pure consciousness in it this sheath appears to have
consciousness. Like the earlier sheaths, this sheath is also a modification of
prakriti, since it is a product of the five subtle elements. It is characterized
by knowledge and action. It is the cause of the identification of the jiva with
his body and organs. It is beginningless because creation is beginningless. It
performs various actions, good and bad, prompted by its vaasanas. The states of
waking and dream and the experiences of joy, sorrow, etc., belong to it. (In
these statements this sheath is identified with the subtle body of which it
forms a part.) Because of the identification of the Atma with this sheath, the
qualities of the latter are wrongly attributed to the Atma, just as fire is said
to be long or round according to the shape of the iron rod or ball which has
been made red-hot.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font size="4">It has been said above that the sheath of the
intellect, which is the limiting adjunct of the Atma, is beginningless. The
question arises, whether it is also endless, in which case, no liberation would
be possible. The answer is that this limitation and the consequent
identification with the sheath are only due to delusion caused by ignorance. The
Atma is unattached, actionless and formless. It can have no connection with the
objects of the world, just as blueness has really no connection with the sky.
Jivahood continues only as long as there is delusion born of ignorance. When the
delusion ceases on the destruction of ignorance by knowledge, the jivahood
ceases and there is only Atma or Brahman.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font size="4">Though avidya is beginningless, it has an end. When
right knowledge arises, avidya ceases to exist. The knowledge that the jivatma
is none other than the Paramatma (Brahman) is what is called right knowledge.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font size="4">Just as water is not clear when it is associated
with mud, but becomes clear when the mud is removed, the Atma is realized in its
pure state when the taint of identification with the body-mind complex is
removed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font size="4">The sheath of the intellect cannot be the Atma
because it is subject to change, is insentient, is limited, is an object of
perception and is not constant, being dormant in deep sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
