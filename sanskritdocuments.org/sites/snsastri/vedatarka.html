        <p class="MsoBodyText3"><font face="Arial" size="4">The realization of
        Brahman results from the firm conviction arising out of deliberation on
        the upanishadic texts and their meaning, but not from other means of
        knowledge such as inference, etc. With regard, however, to the texts
        that speak of the origin, sustenance and dissolution of the universe,
        even reasoning, not opposed to these texts, is not ruled out as a means
        of reinforcing the meaning of these texts. In fact, the upanishads
        themselves accept reasoning as an aid. For instance, it is said, “The
        Self is to be heard about, to be rflected on” (Br.up.2.4.5). And also
        the text, “A man, well-informed and intelligent, can reach the country
        of the Gandharas; similarly, a man who has a teacher attains
        knowledge” (Ch.up.6.14.2), shows that the texts rely on the aid of the
        human intellect also (i.e. they give importance to reasoning).<span style="mso-spacerun:

        <p class="MsoBodyText3"><font face="Arial" size="4">It was also claimed
        that by enjoining reflection over and above hearing, the Br. up. itself
        indicates that logic also is to be accepted. Though this is so, mere
        empty logic cannot be given a place here merely because of this; for,
        logic conforming to the upanishads is alone resorted to here as a
        subsidiary means to help realization. The logic that is acceptable is of
        the following nature. Since the states of sleep and wakefulness
        contradict each other, the Self is not identified with either of them;
        since the individual soul dissociates itself from the world in the state
        of deep sleep to become one with the Self which is Existence, it must be
        the same as the transcendental Self; since the universe has originated
        from Brahman and since the principle is that cause and effect are
        non-different, the universe must be non-different from Brahman; and so
        on. It is reasoning of this kind that has been used in VivekachuuDaamaNi
        to conclude that none of the five sheaths can be the self (verse 156
        onwards).</font></p>

        <p class="MsoBodyText3"><font face="Arial" size="4">For this reason also
        one should not, on the strength of mere logic, propound something that
        has to be known only from the Vedas. Reasoning that has no foundation in
        the Veda and springs from the imagination of persons lacks
        conclusiveness. Man’s conjecture has no limits. Thus it is seen that
        an argument put forward by one learned person is proved to be
        unsustainable by another learned person. That again is proved to be
        untenable by yet another person. The result is that no argument can be
        accepted as conclusive. It is well known that even great men like Kapila
        and kanada hold divergent views. (Therefore, only conclusions firmly
        based on the scriptures and supplemented by proper reasoning can stand
        scrutiny).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></i><span style="mso-spacerun:

        authority. In the case of rites there is no question of direct
        experience, since the result is to be attained only at some future time,
        whereas in the case of knowledge of Brahman actual experience is the
        culmination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
