'indriyas'. These form part of the subtle body. The corresponding organs in the
physical or gross body are known as 'golaka'. The mind is the ruler of the ten
organs of perception and action. It is situated within the heart-lotus. It is
known as the inner organ (antahkarana). It depends on the ten organs for its
functions in relation to external objects. The mind is constituted of the three
gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas. The mind undergoes changes which are caused by
the gunas. Sattva guna produces non-attachment, forgiveness, generosity and
similar virtues in the mind. Rajas gives rise to emotions such as desire, anger,
avarice and is the cause of the person undertaking various actions. Tamas is
responsible for lethargy, confusion, drowsiness, etc. When sattva is predominant
in the mind, merit (punya) is acquired; when rajas predominates, demerit (papa)
results. When tamas is predominant, life is merely wasted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

trunk, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. These are all different from one
another. These are differences within one object, namely, the tree. Such a
difference is known as 'svagatabheda' or internal difference. The difference of
one tree from another is known as '</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

same species. The difference of a tree from a stone (or from any object other
than a tree) is called '</span>vijatiyabheda' <span style="letter-spacing:
-.5pt">or difference between objects of  different species. Since Brahman is the
only reality, and there is nothing else of the same species or of a different
species, there can be no difference of the last two kinds in Brahman. Since
Brahman is homogeneous and without parts, there can be no internal difference.
Brahman is therefore described as 'one only, without a second' (ekam eva
advitiyam). The word 'one' negates '</span>sajatiyabheda'; the word 'only'
rejects 'svagatabheda'; and the words 'without a second' negate <span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">'</span>vijatiyabheda'.
Brahman can be experienced when the mind becomes absolutely tranquil. Brahman is
self-revealing and is the witness of the cessation of all modifications of the
mind. <span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">Maya </span>is the power of Brahman and
has no existence independent of Brahman. <span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">Maya
</span>cannot be known directly, but can only be inferred from its effect, the
universe. Before the manifestation of the universe <span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">Maya

Sruti says that the created universe forms only a part of Brahman. In the <span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">Gita
Sri Krishna says to Arjuna, &quot;The universe is sustained by a part of
Me&quot;. Though Brahman is without parts, the Sruti speaks of it as having
parts, using the language familiar to us. With Brahman as the substratum, Maya
modifies itself into all the objects in the world, just like various pictures
drawn on a wall. The first modification of Maya is space. Space derives its
existence from Brahman. That is to say, space appears to exist only because of
its substratum, Brahman, which is existence itself. Space has sound as its
quality. It is Brahman or Existence which appears as </span>akasa (<span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">space),
but ordinary people and the logicians consider existence as a property of </span>akasa.
This wrong notion is due to <span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">Maya. </span>Space
has no existence apart from Brahman. Similarly, the other elements, air, fire,
water and earth too have no existence apart from Brahman. They are not real in
the absolute sense, but appear to be real because of the substratum, Brahman.
Brahman is all-pervading, but the range of <span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">Maya
is limited, that of space is more limited and that of air yet more so. <o:p>

predecessors, space, air and fire. Earth has the specific property of smell, in
