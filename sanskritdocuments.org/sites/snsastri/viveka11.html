</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">This sheath, known as the
praanamaya-kosha, is made up of the vital air (with its five subdivisions) and
the five organs of action. It permeates the sheath of food and enables it to
perform all its functions. But, as already stated in the previous article, this
sheath is also insentient and is enlivened only by the self. The vital air is
nothing but a form of wind. So it cannot be the self.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><b><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">The sheath of

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">This sheath, known as
manomaya-kosha, consists of the mind and the five organs of knowledge. It
permeates the sheaths of vital air and food. It is the cause of the sense of
‘I’ and ‘mine’. This sheath is very powerful because bondage and
liberation depend on the mind. Attachment of the mind to sense objects is the
cause of bondage and detachment towards them is the means to liberation. The
five organs of perception bring offerings to the mind in the form of experience
of sense objects. The sheath of the mind is described as the sacrificial fire,
the five organs of perception as the sacrificial priests, and the sense objects
are the oblations which are being continuously poured into the sacrificial fire.
The vasanas in the mind are the dry fuel for the fire. If there is no fuel,
there can be no lasting flame in the sacrificial altar even<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>though the oblation, clarified butter, is continuously poured
into it. Similarly if there are no vasanas, the mere presence of sense objects
will not be able to produce bondage. It is the vasanas that obstruct one’s
spiritual progress. So it has been said that the elimination of vasanas is
liberation. When the mind is functioning, as in the waking state, there is
bondage in the form of identification with the body and the sense of possession,
which are the cause of sorrow. When the mind is not functioning, as in deep
sleep, there is no identification with the body and so there is no experience of
sorrow.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">In dream there are no
objects, but various objects and experiences are created by the mind. Similarly
the objects in the waking state are also not real. They are only an expansion of
the mind.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText3" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">(Note.
In this context Mandukya Karika, ch.2, verses 6 and 7 are relevant. Verse 6 says
that what does not exist in the beginning and at the end is unreal. By this test
things experienced in the waking state as well as those in dream are equally
unreal. Verse 7 points out that the objects of the waking state are contradicted
in the dream state. For example, a man goes to bed after a full meal, but soon
dreams that he is extremely hungry. A man who dreams that he has eaten a hearty
meal, wakes up feeling very hungry. Because of these reasons, things experienced
in both the states are equally unreal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
though they are both unreal, it is admitted that there is a difference between
the two. In his Bhashya on Brahma sutra 2.2.29 Sri Sankara points out that there
is a difference between the dream state and the waking state. The difference
consists in the perceptions in dream being sublated immediately afterwards and
the other not. To a man who has woken up from sleep the objects perceived in
dream never had any existence at all, for he says “I falsely imagined that I
was in the company of great men. In fact, I never came in contact with great
men; this delusion arose because my mind was overpowered by sleep”. But an
object seen in the waking state, such as a pillar, is not thus sublated under
any condition. Moreover, dream vision is a kind of remembrance, whereas the
visions of the waking state are forms of perception. The difference between
remembrance and perception, consisting in the absence and presence of objects,
is well known).<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">In the state of dreamless
sleep nothing is experienced because the mind is dormant. This further
establishes that the mind is the creator of objects in dream and waking. Clouds
are brought together by the wind and they are also dispersed by the wind.
Similarly both bondage and liberation are brought about by the mind. The mind
creates attachment for all objects including one’s own body and binds a man.
Later the same mind creates aversion for objects by reminding him of their
harmful nature and leads the person to liberation. The mind is the cause of
bondage when it has a preponderance of rajoguna. When the mind becomes free from
rajas and tamas<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it leads to
liberation. The mind becomes capable of leading to liberation if firm
discrimination and strong dispassion are cultivated. So one who seeks liberation
should cultivate these qualities. The mind is like a ferocious tiger which roams
about n the forest of sense-objects. The wise person should restrain the mind
from roaming about in this forest. It is the mind that produces the experiences
of sense-objects and creates all kinds of distinction such as body, varna,
ashrama, causes and effects.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></span><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4">The jiva is in reality the
pure consciousness which is free from all attachment, but the mind makes him
forget his real nature and identify himself with the body, mind, senses and
vital airs. As a result he looks upon himself as an agent and an enjoyer with
the notions of ‘I’ and ‘mine’. Avidya by itself cannot cause bondage
without the association of the mind. Attachment to the body, etc., is not there
in deep sleep even though avidya is present, because the mind does not function
then. As the mind is the cause of samsaara, the enlightened persons have
declared that the mind itself is avidya. It is by the mind that all jivas are
tossed about like clouds by the wind. Therefore one who seeks liberation should
purify his mind by ridding it of desire, greed, anger, and all other such
emotions. When the mind is pure liberation becomes as clear as a fruit in the
palm of the hand. After getting rid of all attachments the seeker should resort
to sravana, manana, and nididhyaasana (hearing of the scriptures, reflection and
meditation) with faith. This will cleanse the mind of rajoguna.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The sheath of the mind cannot be the self because it has a beginning and
an end, is always undergoing changes, is of the nature of sorrow, and is an
object of knowledge. The self is always the subject and never an object.</font></p>
