    <a name="Nataraja">Nataraja</a> is the Cosmic Dancer. Nothing 
    remains static in dance, or to that matter of fact, in any 
    performing art. That dynamsm is identifiable with naTana, not 
    exactly playuacting, but &#39;doing something&#39;&nbsp; &#39;dynamism&#39; is 
    metophorically termed as naTana, or for an easy identification, 
    &#39;dance&#39; of shiva, and this dynamism is the manifestation of the 
    entire universe. </p>

  <p>

    The manifestation,&nbsp; maintenance, and dissolution of the 
    entire universe being dynamic, it is represented in shiva&#39;s 
    dsances. and he does various kinds of &#39;dances&#39; for the uplkeep of 
    karmic cycle. Iconographically, he is depicted to be performing 
    various dances at various stages of the existence of universe. 
    This is one among the twenty five types of iconographic 
    representations of shiva.</p>

  <p>

    His dance itself is the personification of his eternal dynamism of 
    the universe, and that dance, or the stage of universe is arranged 
    into five categories: (1) <span class="span1">adbhuta taanDava</span> 
    - amazing dance, amazing causation of universe; (2)
    <span class="span1">aananda taanDava</span> - blissful dance - 
    blisful existnce of universe; (3) <span class="span1">anavarata 
    taanDava</span> - incessant dance - incessant nature of universe; 
    (4) <span class="span1">samhaara taanDava</span> - elimination 
    time dance; (5) <span class="span1">pralaya taanDava</span> - 
    dissolution time dance.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

  <p>

    The fifth kind of dance is associated with <span class="span1">
    rudra</span>, the annihilator. <span class="span1">shiva</span>&#39;s 
    name is five lettered <span class="span1">panchakshari</span>. The 
    five syllables are <span class="span1">na, maH, shi, va, ya</span> 
    and recited as <span class="span1">Om namaH shivaayaH</span>, and 
    this is indicative of five capabilities for the divine functions,
    <span class="span1">pancha kriyaa shakti</span>-s namely,&nbsp;
    <span class="span1">sR^iSTi</span>- creation; <span class="span1">
    sthithi</span> - maintenance; <span class="span1">samhaara</span> 
    - destruction; <span class="span1">tirobhaava</span> - illusive; 
    and <span class="span1">anugraha</span> - blessing. The five 
    elements of creation, <span class="span1">pR^iithivi, aapa, teja, 
    vaayu, aakaasha,</span> viz. solidity, liquidity, fire, ether, 
    air, are also denoted by this five lettered name of shiva, which 
    are the essential elements for formation of any being, either 
    living or material.</p>

  <p>

    <img border="0" src="fire_anim.gif" align="right" width="204" height="127"> 
    Nataraja is encircled by the ever glowing and flaming Cosmic 
    Circle, which is termed as<span class="span1"> jwaala maala prabha 
    maNDala, where</span> <span class="span1">jwaala </span>= tongues 
    of flames ; <span class="span1">maala</span> = garland [of 
    flames]; <span class="span1">prabha</span> = glowing;
    <span class="span1">maNDala</span>= nimbus - a nimbus of a garland 
    of tongues of glowing flames - surrounding the entire cosmos.</p>

  <p>

    Nataraja is the embodiment of the resplendence of ever burning, 
    flickering, glowing Cosmic flames like a garland around the deity. 
    This whole universe is filled by him. The entire aspect is to be 
    visualised as dynamism, radiance and glow of the Cosmic Fire, 
    which is present ever and anon.</p>

  <p>

    Nataraja need not be taken iconographically as a dancing god or a 
    god who is designated for destruction. The Cosmic Being, Nataraja, 
    is garlanded by the clusters of galaxies that glow and flicker 
    like heavenly flowers. This Cosmic Entity is depicted by the arch 
    around Nataraja, and with icons of flames studded therein. This 
    glowing galactic circular arch around Nataraja is deciphered as 
    OM, where OM is the sonic source of all the uttered words, to be 
    used later by the living beings for communicating their pains and 
    pleasures.</p>

    Nataraja&#39;s head is adorned with tufts of hairlocks, in which the<img border="0" src="ganga_anim.gif" align="right" width="199" height="150"> 
    ferocious, fleeting River Ganga is locked . Though locked up, 
    Ganga is allowed an ordinary flow like any other river, thus she 
    gave pasture lands to the peasantry. Ganga in the hairlocks of 
    Nataraja represents <span class="span1">sampat samvR^iddhi</span>, 
    where <span class="span1">sampat </span>is wealth;
    <span class="span1">sam vR^ddhi</span> is abundance. Thus River 
    Ganga is an ever growing phenomena of according abundant wealth 
    and material prosperity. </p>

  <p>

    As a perennial river from the Himalaya mountains, Ganga is flowing 
    across the country, enriching the natural resources of the 
    country, even today, and hence she is revered as a goddess.</p>

  <p>

    There is a Crescent Moon in these tufts of Nataraja. This moon is 
    in the rising order to become a full moon, This
    <span class="span1">chandra rekha;</span> <span class="span1">
    chandra</span> = moon; <span class="span1">rekha</span> = 
    crescent; is there for <span class="span1">anugraha</span> i.e., 
    to bestow; to bestow the material pleasures. The Moon is also the 
    deity of Time, according as his increasing / decreasing digits. 
    Thus, Nataraja is designated as the presiding deity of Time, and 
    called <span class="span1">mahaa kaala</span> or
    <span class="span1">tri kaala</span>, where <span class="span1">
    kaala</span> is time. Because he created the immeasurable time, he 
    is regarded as a god who controls the time factor of living 
    beings, hence shiva resorts to dissolution at the end.</p>

  </p>

  <p>

    shiva has three eyes. Of which one is <span class="span1">suurya</span> 
    = Sun; the other is <span class="span1">chandra</span> = moon; 
    while the third eye is <span class="span1">j~naana netra</span> = 
    wisdom eye. This third eye is in the centre of the forehead. Here 
    is where the Hindus apply a decorative vermilion color spot,
    <span class="span1">kumkum</span> or <span class="span1">tilak</span>, 
    lest the wise eye might see unwise things in the life.</p>

  <p>

    Draw an imaginary line from here through to the centre of the 
    brain. There is pituitary in there. It does the same function as 
    that of the wise eye. The attributes of sun and moon to two eyes 
    symbolise the light and darkness, good and bad, greed and content, 
    or any pairs of opposites. But the wise eye shall pre-process this 
    objective material before passing it to the central processor, the 
    decision making <span class="span1">manas</span> = conscience. 
    While these three are just the attributes to the Cosmic Being, the 
    real living beings will also have these three eyes, physically and 
    psychologically.</p>

    <a name="Right Earring">Right Earring</a></p>

  <p>

    On the right ear lobe of Nataraja, there hangs an ear ring called
    <span class="span1">makara kuNDala</span>; <span class="span1">
    makara</span> = crocodile;<img border="0" src="makara.jpg" align="right" width="160" height="160">
    <span class="span1">kuNDala</span> = ear-knob hanging. A golden 
    ear hanging in the shape of a crocodile, usually worn by males 
    will be there on the right ear of shiva. This denotes&nbsp; 
    shiva&#39;s sagaciousness, as such he is the Supreme&nbsp;guru - in his 
    manifestation as <span class="span1">dakshniNAmUrty</span>.</p>

  <p>

    In the bygone centuries the pundits were awarded with the certain 
    ornaments to let others recognise them as pundits of some order. 
    The then universities of traditional education used to award 
    Kashmiri shawls of a particular color, say green to one level, and 
    red to higher level and gold or silver embroidered shawls to 
    highest level of pundits. There were bracelets and anklets also, 
    called <span class="span1">simhatalata-s</span> golden bracelet 
    with lion&#39;s head crafted on it. And anklets called
    <span class="span1">gaNDa penDera-s</span>. They were the 
    ornaments of that day to indicate the social status of wellread 
    pundits. The face being the index of the mind, the ear ring is the 
    subscript of that mind&#39;s IQ. These ear rings were also graded 
    according to their studded diamonds, emerald or rubies, to 
    indicate the educational grade with which they are bestowed.</p>

  <p>

    shiva is the supreme symbol in education, which is symbolised by 
    this ear-hanging on right ear.</font></p>

  <p>

    While elucidating the guru attributes of shiva, the scripts call 
    him <span class="span1">dakshniNAmUrty</span>. In sculputures and 
    images we will be<img border="0" src="dakshinamurthy.jpg" align="right" width="152" height="197"> 
    generaly seeing a picture of a young guru teaching octogenarian 
    students under a big bayan tree, <span class="span1">ashwattha 
    vR^iksha</span>, and we get a laugh about such a reversal of 
    depiction. The teacher in such pictures is shiva in his role of 
    supreme guru, called <span class="span1">dakshniNAmUrty</span>, 
    and the silver-bearded students are the wisom-hungry sages and 
    saints. Supreme intellect is always young and imparts wisdom 
    untiringly, which is to be received properly at any age.</p>

  <p>

    Apart from punditry, Nataraja&#39;s single <span class="span1">makara 
    kuNDala</span> of males on one earlobe, and an eloborate 
    earhanging worn by females on the other earlobe, indicates his 
    half-male-half-female entity. It indicates that his right half is 
    a masculine while the left is a female - symbolised as<span class="span1"> 
    artha naariishvar</span> concept.</p>

  <p style="text-align: right">

    <a href="#PageTop">Top of Page</a></p>

  <div class="emptyspace">
&nbsp;
  </div>
  <p>

    <a name="Left Earring">Left Earring</a></p>

  <p>

    &nbsp;On the left earlobe hangs an earhanging, called
    <span class="span1">taaTanka</span>, which is the jewellery of 
    females, The earhanging of ladies will not indicate scholarly 
    status, but have beauty and decorative values. Hence
    <img border="0" src="left_earhanging.jpg" align="right" width="85" height="197">
    <span class="span1">taaTanka</span> on left earlobe is symbol for 
    a divine feminine beauty. Thus the feminity of left side of 
    shiva&#39;s body is indicated, suggesting that he is both male and 
    female, <span class="span1">artha narii iishwara</span> -
    <span class="span1">artha</span> = half; <span class="span1">naari
    </span>= female; <span class="span1">iishwara</span> = lordship; 
    he is both the lord and the lady. </p>

  <p>

    This &quot;halfness &quot; is not attributable to iishwara. If done so, he 
    will become half God. As Supreme Being is not described thus, but 
    it is said that a female is his part - say the better half - is 
    contained in him. He is not some entity made up of parts, but he 
    created parts from himself. Thus, the Supreme Being who is the 
    whole macrocosmm also accommodates a feminine attribute in his 
    entity - the Supreme Nature. Modern science validates this through 
    X-Y chromosome theory.</p>

  <p>

    The femalehood is given a place of equivalence<img border="0" src="artha_nari.jpg" align="right" width="137" height="240"> 
    with the Supreme.When we say, <span class="span1">maatR^i devo 
    bhava</span>; <span class="span1">maatR^i devo bhava</span>;<span class="span1">aacharya 
    devo</span><span class="span1"> bhava</span> - it is not just 
    saluting the three, the mother, father and the tutor. These three, 
    put together, are available in Nataraja; say shiva - the father; 
    his half entity - the mother; and the guyru in his&nbsp;
    <span class="span1">dakshniNAmUrty</span> variation. He is the 
    father in his naïve being, and the tutor when he is in the role of 
    guru, or dakshiNaamuurti and he is also the mother&nbsp; called
    <span class="span1">prakriti, lalitha, paarvati </span>etc - 
    symolised just by left ear-hanging. Thus, the two kinds of ear 
    hangings of Nataraja emphasise that shiva is father-mother-guru. 
    This is his family.</p>

    <a name="Cobra">Cobra</a></p>

  <p>

    There is a cobra creeping around his neck, upper arms, or chest. 
    This snake is called <span class="span1">kuNDalini</span>. The 
    serpent represents a coiling power, <span class="span1">kuNDalini 
    shakti</span>; <span class="span1">kuNDala</span> = coiling,
    <span class="span1">shakti</span> = power; the innate power of any 
    being. Physiologically this serpent is identified with the 
    sympathetic and para-sympathetic nervous systems creeping along 
    the vertebral column, or resting in a coiled form near at coccyx. 
    The insignia of allopathic medicine may be remembered wherein two 
    serpents entwine a trident like spear. This innate power is the 
    one that keeps the system working by its coiling and uncoiling 
    powers. Yoga, a physio-psychological system has vastly enriched in 
    its tenets basing on this kuNDalini shakti, and brought into real 
    life many of the hidden practices of good and great living.</p>

  <p>

    A holy thread hangs from the left shoulder to the downside of 
    right flank, called <span class="span1">yaj~nopaviitam</span> 
    symbolising the Purity of Being. This thread is the basic 
    requirement to perform a Yajna, a Holy Vedic ritual, performed for 
    the purification of inner self as well as the society at large. 
    Any person without this thread is not eligible to perform certain 
    rituals. Thus the Supreme Being is attributed with the right to 
    perform Universal Rituals, may it be creation and dissolution or 
    maintenance of the Universe, He has the authority to perform them.
  </p>

  <p>

    This sacred thread reminds them who wear it, to live a purified 
    life and undertake a holy attitude towards his own living and that 
    of others.</p>

    <a name="Divine Drum">Divine Drum</a></p>

  <p>

    Nataraja is depicted with four arms. It is the sculptor&#39;s way of 
    showing the personification of ambidexterity. He is not a person 
    nor a<img border="0" src="drum.jpg" align="right" width="116" height="122"> 
    created being. He is no effect of any cause, but a cause in 
    himself. Thus his four arms are to be visualised for multitude of 
    works performed for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of 
    the universe. It is not like watching an octopus or a centipede, 
    but a cosmic entity who can perform omnifarious deeds.</p>

  <p>

    In the upper right hand there is a drumming instrument called
    <span class="span1">Dhakka</span> or <span class="span1">Damaru</span>. 
    It is a double sided drumming instrument which gives out sonorous 
    rhythm, too devastating to contain. Nataraja sounded it for 
    fourteen times resulting in creation of roaring and thundering 
    sonic boom in the skies, which in turn created the Universe. This 
    drum is the symbol for the entire creation and perhaps the much 
    discussed Big Bang might have emanated from this drum beat. In 
    this sonic boom, <span class="span1">dhwani</span>, there emerged 
    root sounds of aa, ii, uu etc., wherefrom the first letter
    <span class="span1">a</span> of Sanskrit is taken by mankind. Thus 
    Nataraja is called <span class="span1">naada brahma</span>. This 
    letter is common across universal languages, say Alpha of Greek or 
    A of English or Aleef of Arabic or any other first letter. It is 
    from this dhwani, the sonic boom, the Vedas etc., have emerged. 
    Thus Natataja&#39;s hand still bears that drum lest the uttered word 
    is not dead.</p>

    The left upper hand holds Eternal Fire. He is already surrounded 
    by devastating cosmic fire, then why handling this fire like a 
    torchlight... This handheld fire is the essentail principle of 
    life,<img border="0" src="fire_in_hand.gif" align="right" width="153" height="153"> 
    with which everything transforms, either biological bodies to 
    ashes, or seawater to raincloud etc. The process called Five-Fire 
    Process, <span class="span1">pancha agni vidya </span>stems from 
    this fire alone, which in a rudimentary way is this: </p>

  <p>

    When humans on earth oblate watery substances like curds, ghee, 
    milk, or at least water for gods, gods receive it and in turn 
    oblate it in the celestial fire, called <span class="span1">dyu 
    loka agni</span>, mixing with <span class="span1">soma</span>, the 
    nectarious principle. Again when gods oblate that nectarian
    <span class="span1">soma</span> into <span class="span1">parjanya 
    agni</span>, fire in raincloud, it becomes rain, and showers the 
    same in the fire of earth, <span class="span1">bhuumi agni</span>, 
    whereby earth yields food. Then the gods oblate that food in the 
    fire of males, <span class="span1">puruSha agni</span>, i.e., they 
    destine males to consume that particular food with nectarian 
    principle in it, which gets transformed as a fruitful seminal 
    fluid in males. And fianlly the same gods oblate the same fruitful 
    fluid, via their fortunate males, in the fire of females called
    <span class="span1">yoShita agni</span>, whereby that soul which 
    originally oblated liquids to gods takes birth as an offspring of 
    that couple. Thus the cycle of birth and death becomes continuous.</p>

  <p>

    This eternal fire keeps on burning from birth to death, causes 
    Five-Fire Process, and thus it keeps the Universe on its wheel, as 
    such shiva holds it, rather controls it.</p>

    The lower right hand is called <span class="span1">abhaya hasta</span>,

    The dance-gesture, <span class="span1">mudra</span> of left lower 
    hand is called <span class="span1">Dola hasta</span>, a munificent 
    hand. This gesture indicates that benefits of living are bestowed 
    as well as the benefit of dying, i.e. <span class="span1">moksha</span>, 
    final liberation,<img border="0" src="dola_hasta.jpg" align="right" width="181" height="99"> 
    from the cycle of birth and death, if the seeker is a correct 
    knower of truth. Hinduism has no fanatic beliefs in religion. 
    Hinduism itself is not an ardent religion, but it is a
    <span class="span1">dharma,</span> Way of Living. That is why a 
    correct knower of the truth is required rather than a fanatic 
    follower. Bhagavat Gita, the Divine Song, also says this. For that 
    matter, every Hindu script iterates this: &quot;just KNOW me, you are 
    absolved of the birth-death cycle.&quot; So, an honest seeker will get 
    all he wants, not material gains, but spiritual upliftment, from 
    this <span class="span1">Dola hasta</span>.</p>

    The posture of right leg is called <span class="span1">sthita 
    padam</span>, firm foot, firmly staying on its ground, meaning 
    that the Supreme Being is Omnipresent.<img border="0" src="dwarf.gif" width="203" height="159" align="right"> 
    There is a dying demon underneath this firm foot. He is a dwarf 
    demon representing <span class="span1">Rug, jwara, maraNa</span>; 
    i.e., <span class="span1">Rug= rugmata, roga</span> = disease;
    <span class="span1">jwara</span> = fever, any febrile condition ;
    <span class="span1">maraNa</span> = death, decay; which are 
    natural to the living beings, but most cruel at the same time.</p>

  <p>

    To get rid of these evils, the demon is to be suppressed by the 
    Supreme Being who created them along with the living beings. 
    Living itself is a disease.</p>

  <p>

    Notice that the demon is not dead under the thumping right foot of 
    that powerful Supreme Being. That demon is suppressed, because 
    living without these evils will tantamount living in heaven, which 
    is promised only to the correct Knower, but not to all. This may 
    be called the Spiritual Realism.</p>

    The posture of left leg is just raised from the ground, as a dance 
    posture, and this foot is termed as <span class="span1">anugarha 
    pada</span> or <span class="span1">moksha pada</span>,<img border="0" src="dancing_foot.gif" align="right" width="180" height="83"> 
    bestowing foot. In Indian culture saluting to the feet of elders 
    or teachers is a symbolic representation of utter submission to 
    elders. It is not like the kneeling posture of subjects at a 
    throne or a monarch. Nataraja&#39;s raised left foot is made available 
    to the seekers for salutation in order to obtain knowledge of the 
    Supreme Being and thereby to get moksha, he salvation.</p>

    Nataraja will be shown&nbsp; either naked, <span class="span1">
    digambara</span>, means one who has quarters as his dress, or in a 
    tiger&#39;s skin, or in an elephant&#39;s skin. This depiction is,
    <span class="span1">viirata chihna</span>, symbol of Omnipotence. 
    He has chains of small ringing bells decorated at his ankles, 
    thighs, waist, wrists etc.,&nbsp; producing lilting sounds.</p>

  <p>

    His Cosmic Dance in its totality is called <span class="span1">
    pancha kriya shakti;</span> <span class="span1">pancha</span>=five;
    <span class="span1">kriya</span>=functions;<span class="span1"> 
    shakti</span>= power; i.e. the absolute power to make the function 
    of any pentad, say the creation of five elements of nature,
    <span class="span1">pR^ithivi, aapa, teja, vaayu, aakaasha,</span> 
    viz. solidity, liquidity, fire, ether, air; or, to make the 
    functioning of five sensory organs to work; or, the power to 
    maintain <span class="span1">pancha-agni-vidya</span>... etc.</p>

  <p>

    &nbsp;Unlike dialectical materialism, spiritualism needs some spiritual 
    power as &quot; a priori &quot;, which does all the creation, maintnance and 
    dissolution of the universe. Thus, the <span class="span1">pancha 
    kriya shakti</span> is vested with Nataraja.</p>
