  <p class="tat">

    When a devotee of Krishna receives <span class="span1">shuddha sattva,</span> 'purest attribute' it is 
    transformed later into <span class="span1">rati</span> or <span class="span1">prema ankura</span>. Then it 
    ripens into <span class="span1">prema</span>, not general love but a sense of 'mineness' i.e., a feeling 
    that Krishna belongs to me, none else. On some more devotion it ripens into <span class="span1">sneha</span> 
    'divided togetherness' an unsatisfied feeling with words and play of Krishna, because he is a separate 
    entity as yet. This ripens to <span class="span1">maana</span> 'intense love' where he/she conceals his 
    own feelings, on account of real/unreal grievance, and then on he/she starts to show jealousy, anger or 
    petulance etc., towards Krishna. These <span class="span1">maana abhimaana</span> contain
    <span class="span1">maadana bhaava</span>, a maddening delight, essentially possessed by Raadha, none 
    else, not even by Krishna. [Source: The Cultural Heritage of India, Vol. IV - Religions.] This chapter 
    details that exclusive <span class="span1">maadana mahaa bhaava</span> of Raadha in her angering, 
    tongue-lashing, upbraiding etc.</p>

    &nbsp;In the meanwhile - during the time when girlfriend is telling about Raadha to Krishna. A sinner has to 
    bear a badge of infamy, may it be the black spot on moon, or this impertinent boy Krishna for his 
    non-arrival at Raadha.</p>

    &nbsp;When Krishna grappled that girl's bun for a kiss, she wanted to whisk, and in her wriggling to take an 
    upper hand over him, her braid is loosened and slithered, hence flowers too wriggly rolled down, yet she 
    is dominant and on his overside, called <span class="span1">puruSa aayata</span> While saying
    <span class="span1">madhu ripu</span> the sense of <span class="span1">maadhurya ripu</span> is what is 
    meant by Raadha: 'he is unaware of niceties in relishing love <span class="span1">maadhurya anabhij~natva</span> 
    because a rustic girl, less proficient than Raadha has overcome on him. The word <span class="span1">
    yuvatiH</span> suggests that the girl has a doership <span class="span1">strii kartR^itva - vipariita 
    surata</span> is indicated. Raadha is saying that 'this girl is more talented...' then it a subjective 
    statement of envy plus jealousy. Because she beckoned him to come to certain bower, but this girl brought 
    him round to her place and enjoying with him in a domineering position - hence she should be more 
    talented... as a second thought.</p>

  <p class="comment">

    &nbsp;In fact this girlfriend is sorry faced unable to see the plight of Raadha. But Raadha being as 
    tongue-lasher, next only to Seetha of Valmiki, in a kind of identification she lashes her tongue at this 
    girl. These messengers have a part to play when sent on delegation such delegations, unlike our present 
    day ambassadors who always parrot out 'I will ask my govt. and xerox that reply to your govt....' . In 
    Ramayana Hanuma burns Lanka after seeing Seetha. Krishna shows his Cosmic Body after the failure of peace 
    talks in Bharata.</p>

  <p class="comment">

    So also, this girl must have done something that is rendering her silent. Commentators bring another shade 
    of meaning. Though its word-to-word translation is not given, the gist is like this: 1st stanza: you are 
    worrying because you might have had an ungratified bout with him, unsayable to me. And you objectionably 
    worry for my saying about him as a 'philanderer, merciless one' because he might have 'philandered' with 
    you for he is too 'mercifully.' 2nd stanza: I myself say that he has many sweethearts, and said this even 
    previously. So you took chance to become one, though at present you are sent as my agent. 3rd and 4th 
    stanzas: I don't mind his volitions and vacillations with your like, but I have none else than him from 
    day one. So, when my heart bursts and soul merges in him, then you all put together have your butterflying 
    and philandering... don't worry, just wait for it...</p>

    In early morning when Raadha and Krishna are coming out of their love resort, Krishna is wrapped in 
    Raadha's black blanket, and Raadha's bust is wrapped with Krishna ochry silks. On seeing this, her 
    friend's circle started to laugh teasingly in order to confuse her. That being so, Krishna with coyly 
    fluttering eyes kept on his slanting glances on Raadha in a 'what-to-do-now' attitude. Hence, let that 
    lovely and smiley-faced son of Nanda be delightful to the entire world. [7-14]</p>
