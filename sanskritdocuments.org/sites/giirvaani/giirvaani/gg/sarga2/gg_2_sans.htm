<p class="sansloka">&nbsp;A¬ezkezvm!</p>

<p class="tat">&nbsp;Intolerant of Krishna’s flirtatious behaviour with other girls, 
Raadha deviates from ronde and complains all her feelings to her friend. Even in 
her complaining that Krishna is cheerfully irresponsible – blithesome Krishna, for 
his prema, love divine. <span style="color: #660033">aklesha keshava</span>, she 
extols Krishna’s enrapturing nature.</p>

<p class="tat">Steeply slithered is Raadha&#39;s privilege, for Krishna&#39;s love is equipoise 
in respect of all other milkmaids and herself, and thus some grudge overtook her 
when he is pleasure-tripping with others, hence she has gone elsewhere, somewhere 
into a bower of tendrils, that which is noisy with the humming of 
honeybee-swarms spiralling&nbsp; at its spire, and when she steeped into that bower she forlornly said this 
to her girlfriend, in solitude. [2-1]</p>

<p class="comment">She became a forlorn one as the humming noise of bees is increasing 
her passion for Krishna <span class="span1">bhramaraiH kaamoddiipita</span> hence, 
unable to endure it she has become somewhat a forlorn one, who otherwise is a resolute 
girl.</p>

<p class="comment">Again the word <span style="color: #660033">rahaH sakhiim uvaaca</span> 
is sometimes said as &#39; she told her secrets...&#39; etc. But whole world knows what 
her secret is, i.e., to have Krishna for herself... Hence, it is - said in solitude 
- what she is going to say is not to be heard by others... even if someone is going 
to eavesdrop she/he shall presume it as the humming of bees, as she is going to 
tell next <span style="color: #660033">aSTa padi</span> in a tune and wording almost 
like the buzz of bees.</p>

<p class="comment">Then, <span style="color: #660033">diinaa api</span> forlorn 
one, even so; even so she became a forlorn one by losing her pride, she got guts 
in regaining it - cf., Ramayana, 4-6-23, <span style="color: #660033">tataH saH 
raaghavaH diinaH sugriivam idam abraviit</span>... even if Rama became a forlorn

<p class="comment">In this verse it is <span style="color: #660033">vipralambha

<p class="comment">Please read the word <span style="color: #660033">mukha</span> 
as face, but not as mouth, since mouth&#39;s function is different from that of lips, 
insofar as kissing is concerned. Whenever Raadha sees a
<span style="color: #660033">Bandhuuka</span> flower, a rosy red flower, Krishna&#39;s 
delicate lower lip is coming to her mind, but unavailable is his face, as other 
round-bottomed girls are invading it. Then why not Raadha follow the suite of other 
girls? How can she do so, when others are mobbing him? Moreover she wants him, only 
for herself, without any sharing or partaking. Then the friend may question her, 
asking &#39;why you are after that boy when he is after those many?&#39; For that Raadha&#39;s 
answer is: &#39;He is fully interested in me... none else...
<span style="color: #660033">la.mbhita lobham</span>... but he acquired an interestedness, 
created by those girls, when all those girls forcibly dragged him away, so allowed

<p class="comment">The word <span style="color: #660033">tamisram</span> is not 
the darkness of night alone, but the general darkness, gloom, ignorance etc., as 
in <span style="color: #660033">tamasomaa jyotir gamayaH</span>. A single ray of 
light from his jewellery is enough to dispel any kind of darkness, then what more 
can be said of his total jewellery and about himself. Thus the ignorance of all 
the other milkmaids is dispelled, call them as sages and saints of Ramayana times, 
as you may, as a kind of deliverance.</p>

<p class="comment">On Raadha&#39;s side, she is remembering their starting time episodes. 
When they started homeward the night was falling, and the pathway was darksome. 
Krishna played her along till she came very near to him. But when she neared him 
all the darkness around them is dispelled only because of the luminosity of his 
jewellery, and she was prudish to be with him in broad daylight like resplendence. 
She ran away into darkness. But he is already there with his luminosity and it was 
inescapable for her to avoid him, in many an attempt. In the meanwhile other milkmaids 
came and carried him away, and she is disgruntled, and now she is grunting about 
it.</p>

<p class="comment">The moon moving in clouds is reminding her about the round sandal-paste 
mark on Krishna&#39;s forehead. The moon may not be moving in clouds as in
<span style="color: #660033">shaakhaa-candra nyaaya</span>, but Krishna&#39;s head is 
definitely and constantly nodding while piping his flute. Then his face is like 
a mass of clouds, and mark on forehead is brilliant than the semi-visible moon in 
clouds. Though he is boy his chest is so hardened to keep his all-loving heart in 
a strong-doored strongroom. From his childhood his chest is rubbed against busty 
bosomy breasts, either of women of Vraj or demoness Puutana from Madhura. Hence 
this boy is calculatingly entertaining unassuming milkmaids, but heedless of Raadha, 
as her claim is for ownership of the very same boy, and hence Raadha is with this 
discontentment, yet not able to forget him.</p>

<p class="comment">Here his followers are said in singular, but we usually take 
it as plural for generalisation. In singularity they are: among gods it is Sage 
Narada; among demons it is Emperor Bali; among humans it is Bhiishma pitaamah, where 
all the three symbolise &#39;surrendering, forfeiture, dedication...&#39; Narada is an out-and-out 
dedicatee of Vishnu and his incarnations, Emperor Bali is a non-naysayer, and Bhiishma 
is renowned for his forfeiture of a vast kingdom for the sake of one solemn promise. 
Of course, Raadha as an illiterate &#39;thumb-impression&#39; girl may not know all these 
things, but the poet knows, and hence he puts these expressions on her tongue, since 
she too is no less a devotee. She as a poor girl from a hamlet may not have kingdoms 
to forego like Bhiishma, spheres of worlds like Bali, and utmost scriptural knowledge 
like Narada. But she is female and female&#39;s body and soul alone are her property 
or possessions, hence she wants to surrender them in the Supreme Being.</p>

<p class="comment">The expression <span style="color: #660033">surata vitaanam</span> 
- is many kinds of unions, namely <span style="color: #660033">indraaNi bandha</span> 
etc., explained by <span style="color: #660033">vaastyaana kaama suutra</span>-s, 
possible only for yogis or experts in <span style="color: #660033">sringaara shaastra</span>. 
The girdle-chain-set is not an exaggerated expression, where that girdle ornament 
contains festoons of golden strings, ranging from a set of three to hundreds. Please 
see Seetha&#39;s Marriage, <span style="color: #660033">siitaa kalyaan</span> in Ramayana, 
where each type is detailed. And making this sort of girdle-chain to fall without 
unfastening is called <span style="color: #660033">prenkhollikita vipariita rati</span> 
- where <span style="color: #660033">vipariita rati</span> - is not a crude type, 
but again a climatic and masterly act.</p>

<p class="comment">Caveat: All this stuff, like masterly acts, climatic union etc., 
will be good for reading and listening. Better limit them up to that stage. Trying 
to implement these things, on purchasing cheap books sold on railway platforms, 
or deducing from such half-baked translations like these, would be harmful, and 
we are told that a threat of death looms on one&#39;s head, if these yogic practices 
are practiced, without proper knowledge. Just construe that Krishna is a supramundane 
bhogi and yogi, and salute him. That&#39;s all.</p>

retold by me, an ecstasied milkmaid Raadha, let this song broadly pass blessedness 
all round, to one and all, and such as I am, a well-wisher of one and all, and wishing 
now for Krishna, oh, friend, why don&#39;t you make him to take delight in me now, when 
my heart and mind are filled with love for him... [a pa 6-8]</p>

<p class="comment">Some sentences are ellipted in the above summing up for the subtext. 
This song will not heard, in general, as it is loaded with some &#39;nakedness&#39; in expression, 
and peripherally it sounbds &#39;bad&#39; and no singer can go on singing the praise of
<span style="color: #660033">alankaara</span> or <span style="color: #660033">sringaara 
shaastra</span> contained in it. Hence it is ill fated to be sung. If at all it 
is sung, it is singable in <span style="color: #660033">guNa kriya raaga, eka taala</span>, 
again both are unknown tunes and rhythms, and none sings them in the tunes suggested 
by the poet-singer-dancer Jayadeva these days.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh, friend, when he was frolicking as he likes with the flocks of 
milkmaids, I suddenly entered the ronde, then on goggling me his playful flute Mohana 
Vamshi slid from his hands, and his wiry awry eyebrows raised, and he started to 
cast sidelong glances at me, as he is abashed to be among the throngs of milkmaids, 
and then on seeing me his cheeks are muchly moist with sweat, but I saw him in woodlands 
of Brindavan, whose face is pretty and whose smile is nectarean, and to see him 
surrounded by mobs of belles of Braj, I must be delighted - Really? [2-3]</p>

<p class="comment">I am delighted, or, I am delighted also etc., words of Raadha 
are not in appreciation, but they are her snappish words with jealousy and derision.

of other girls, while I was present... and such as he was, now why doesn&#39;t he come 
now, when I long for him?&quot; - This is according to her ownership&#39;s viewpoint, as
