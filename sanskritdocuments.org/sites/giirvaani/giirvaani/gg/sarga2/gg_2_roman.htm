<p class="tat">

  &nbsp;Intolerant of Krishna’s flirtatious behaviour with other girls, 
  Raadha deviates from ronde and complains all her feelings to her 
  friend. Even in her complaining that Krishna is cheerfully 
  irresponsible – blithesome Krishna, <span class="span1">aklesha 
  keshava,</span>she extols Krishna’s enrapturing nature.</p>

<p class="tat">

  Steeply slithered is Raadha's privilege, for Krishna's love is 
  equipoise in respect of all other milkmaids and herself, and thus 
  some grudge overtook her when he is pleasure-tripping with others, 
  hence she has gone elsewhere, somewhere into a bower of tendrils, 
  that which is noisy with spiralling swarms of honeybees' humming at 
  its spire, and when she steeped into that bower she forlornly said 
  this to her girlfriend, in solitude. [2-1]</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;She became a forlorn one as the humming noise of bees is increasing 
  her passion for Krishna <span class="span1">bhramaraiH kaamoddiipita</span>hence, 
  unable to endure it she has become somewhat a forlorn one, who 
  otherwise is a resolute girl.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Again the word <span class="span1">rahaH sakhiim uvaaca</span> is 
  sometimes said as ' she told her secrets...' etc. But whole world 
  knows what her secret is, i.e., to have Krishna for herself... 
  Hence, it is - said in solitude - what she is going to say is not to 
  be heard by others... even if someone is going to eavesdrop she/he 
  shall presume it as the humming of bees, as she is going to tell 
  next <span class="span1">aSTa padi</span>in a tune and wording 
  almost like the buzz of bees.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Then, <span class="span1">diinaa api</span>forlorn one, even so; 
  even so she became a forlorn one by losing her pride, she got guts 
  in regaining it - cf., Ramayana, 4-6-23, <span class="span1">tataH 
  saH raaghavaH diinaH sugriivam idam abraviit</span>... even if Rama 
  became a forlorn one, he spoke to <span class="span1">Sugreeva</span> 
  self-confidently.</p>

  &nbsp;Here there are two concepts. One, any seen peacock is reminding her 
  of Krishna as he has peacock plumes in his crown. The other, every 
  cloud is appearing like him, as blue-black, cerulean hue is common 
  to both, and common are the colourful rainbow on a cloud and 
  rainbow-like attire on this boy. Hence she is in a fit of the blues.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Please read the word <span class="span1">mukha</span> as face, but 
  not as mouth, since mouth's function is different from that of lips, 
  insofar as kissing is concerned. Whenever Raadha sees a
  <span class="span1">Bandhuuka</span>flower, a rosy red flower, 
  Krishna's delicate lower lip is coming to her mind, but unavailable 
  is his face, as other round-bottomed girls are invading it. Then why 
  not Raadha follow the suite of other girls? How can she do so, when 
  others are mobbing him? Moreover she wants him, only for herself, 
  without any sharing or partaking. Then the friend may question her, 
  asking 'why you are after that boy when he is after those many?' For 
  that Raadha's answer is: 'He is fully interested in me... none 
  else... <span class="span1">la.mbhita lobham</span>... but he 
  acquired an interestedness, created by those girls, when all those 
  girls forcibly dragged him away, so allowed them to kiss his face... 
  hence, I extol him and his attributes, as he really belongs to 
  me...'</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;The word <span class="span1">tamisram</span>is not the darkness of 
  night alone, but the general darkness, gloom, ignorance etc., as in
  <span class="span1">tamasomaa jyotir gamayaH</span>. A single ray of 
  light from his jewellery is enough to dispel any kind of darkness, 
  then what more can be said of his total jewellery and about himself. 
  Thus the ignorance of all the other milkmaids is dispelled, call 
  them as sages and saints of Ramayana times, as you may, as a kind of 
  deliverance.</p>

<p class="comment">

  On Raadha's side, she is remembering their starting time episodes. 
  When they started homeward the night was falling, and the pathway 
  was darksome. Krishna played her along till she came very near to 
  him. But when she neared him all the darkness around them is 
  dispelled only because of the luminosity of his jewellery, and she 
  was prudish to be with him in broad daylight like resplendence. She 
  ran away into darkness. But he is already there with his luminosity 
  and it was inescapable for her to avoid him, in many an attempt. In 
  the meanwhile other milkmaids came and carried him away, and she is 
  disgruntled, and now she is grunting about it.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;The moon moving in clouds is reminding her about the round 
  sandal-paste mark on Krishna's forehead. The moon may not be moving 
  in clouds as in <span class="span1">shaakhaa-candra nyaaya</span>, 
  but Krishna's head is definitely and constantly nodding while piping 
  his flute. Then his face is like a mass of clouds, and mark on 
  forehead is brilliant than the semi-visible moon in clouds. Though 
  he is boy his chest is so hardened to keep his all-loving heart in a 
  strong-doored strongroom. From his childhood his chest is rubbed 
  against busty bosomy breasts, either of women of Vraj or demoness 
  Puutana from Madhura. Hence this boy is calculatingly entertaining 
  unassuming milkmaids, but heedless of Raadha, as her claim is for 
  ownership of the very same boy, and hence Raadha is with this 
  discontentment, yet not able to forget him.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Here his followers are said in singular, but we usually take it as 
  plural for generalisation. In singularity they are: among gods it is 
  Sage Narada; among demons it is Emperor Bali; among humans it is 
  Bhiishma pitaamah, where all the three symbolise 'surrendering, 
  forfeiture, dedication...' Narada is an out-and-out dedicatee of 
  Vishnu and his incarnations, Emperor Bali is a non-naysayer, and 
  Bhiishma is renowned for his forfeiture of a vast kingdom for the 
  sake of one solemn promise. Of course, Raadha as an illiterate 
  'thumb-impression' girl may not know all these things, but the poet 
  knows, and hence he puts these expressions on her tongue, since she 
  too is no less a devotee. She as a poor girl from a hamlet may not 
  have kingdoms to forego like Bhiishma, spheres of worlds like Bali, 
  and utmost scriptural knowledge like Narada. But she is female and 
  female's body and soul alone are her property or possessions, hence 
  she wants to surrender them in the Supreme Being.</p>

  &nbsp;The expression <span class="span1">surata vitaanam</span> - is many 
  kinds of unions, namely <span class="span1">indraaNi bandha</span>etc., 
  explained by <span class="span1">vaastyaana kaama suutra</span>-s, 
  possible only for yogis or experts in <span class="span1">sringaara 
  shaastra</span>. The girdle-chain-set is not an exaggerated 
  expression, where that girdle ornament contains festoons of golden 
  strings, ranging from a set of three to hundreds. Please see 
  Seetha's Marriage, <span class="span1">siitaa kalyaan</span> in 
  Ramayana, where each type is detailed. And making this sort of 
  girdle-chain to fall without unfastening is called
  <span class="span1">prenkhollikita vipariita rati</span>- where
  <span class="span1">vipariita rati</span>- is not a crude type, but 
  again a climatic and masterly act.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Caveat: All this stuff, like masterly acts, climatic union etc., 
  will be good for reading and listening. Better limit them up to that 
  stage. Trying to implement these things, on purchasing cheap books 
  sold on railway platforms, or deducing from such half-baked 
  translations like these, would be harmful, and we are told that a 
  threat of death looms on one's head, if these yogic practices are 
  practiced, without proper knowledge. Just construe that Krishna is a

  &quot;This song that contains the accounts of Krishna's romantic frolics,

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Some sentences are ellipted in the above summing up for the 
  subtext. This song will not heard, in general, as it is loaded with 
  some 'nakedness' in expression, and peripherally it sounbds 'bad' 
  and no singer can go on singing the praise of <span class="span1">
  alankaara</span>or <span class="span1">sringaara shaastra</span> 
  contained in it. Hence it is ill fated to be sung. If at all it is 
  sung, it is singable in <span class="span1">guNa kriya raaga, eka 
  taala</span>, again both are unknown tunes and rhythms, and none 
  sings them in the tunes suggested by the poet-singer-dancer Jayadeva 
  these days.</p>

  &quot;Oh, friend, when he was frolicking as he likes with the flocks of 
  milkmaids, I suddenly entered the ronde, then on goggling me his 
  playful flute Mohana Vamshi slid from his hands, and his wiry awry 
  eyebrows raised, and he started to cast sidelong glances at me, as 
  he is abashed to be among the throngs of milkmaids, and then on 
  seeing me his cheeks are muchly moist with sweat, but I saw him in 
  woodlands of Brindavan, whose face is pretty and whose smile is 
  nectarean, and to see him surrounded by mobs of belles of Braj, I 
  must be delighted - Really? [2-3]</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;I am delighted, or, I am delighted also etc., words of Raadha are 
  not in appreciation, but they are her snappish words with jealousy 
  and derision. In another way: <span class="span1">bR^inda</span>= 
  groups of belles; <span class="span1">utsaari</span>= to ward off, 
  in dispelling; <span class="span1">driganta viikshitam</span>= with 
  sidelong looks, he who is seeing; meaning that, &quot;when I suddenly 
  gone into ronde, he started to cast sidelong glances at other 
  milkmaids to go away, as he was abashed to be in the company of 
  other girls, while I was present... and such as he was, now why 
  doesn't he come now, when I long for him?&quot; - This is according to 
  her ownership's viewpoint, as he solely belongs to her.</p>
