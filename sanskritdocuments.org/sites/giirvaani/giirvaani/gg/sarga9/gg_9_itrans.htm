<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;This comparison has some illustration about nature, apart from just romance. Palm tree, 
  as all know, is the tallest fruiting tree, and its fruits, not dates, are therefore 
  supposed to be the loftiest among all fruits, both height wise and their content wise. 
  They fruit palm juice in a three-eye sap sockets, and that juice is poor man's much 
  liked cool drink in summer. It instantaneously reduces body heat, minus any side 
  effects, and hence, the palm fruits are praiseworthy for a cooling effect. If these are 
  left unused, for want of some toddy taper, or a climber to go to such a height, as they 
  are 'not-so-easy- to-get' variety, they become stony and fall. Even then, they will be 
  put to use by burning them in grass, for eating its kernel, which has no such medicinal 
  effects. This is in mundane variety of understanding poet's words in commonplace 
  parlance.</p>

<p class="comment">

  The other sense attached to such <span class="span1">anga pratyanga varNana </span>'limb 
  by limb poetising' - it is to be said, whenever a female deity or goddess is pictured, 
  it doesn't go without such descriptions, because a mother is identifiable by bust by the 
  offspring, which was once useful for its birth. Minus them he is nowhere. In 
  <span class="span1">Lalita 
  Sahasra naama</span>, such mother is said to have 'stony breasts...' <span class="span1">
  kaThina sthala maNDalaa... </span>meaning - let millions and millions take birth; this 
  nature somehow nourishes them, for her mamma knows no wizening effect. So, let us give 
  nature its own due.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Yet, Raadha goes on refusing Krishna... for she is an emblem of happiness for Krishna
  <span class="span1">hlaadinii shakti</span>, and a symbol of unquenchable desire, like 
  nature. Krishna will always be trying to quench it, but rarely nature gets satisfied, 
  and demands him to be always with him, instead of incarnating himself now and then, to 
  see her or her wellbeing. Krishna's appearance and disappearance in <span class="span1">
  raasa liila</span>, the ronde dance, in Brindavan symbolises with god's periodic 
  visitation to earth. When it is said, that god created whole universe, in any ism, why 
  he or his messengers chance only upon earth? Why don't they go to Mars, Moon, or to some 
  Black Hole? That too, in India he has to come personally without sending some of his 
  deputies. Because, that so-called Nature, <span class="span1">hlaadini shakti</span>, is 
  only here on this Blue Dot, however querulous she might be. So, instead of remarrying 
  that nature with that god, let us give her, her own due.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Nature's, say this earth's worrying, weeping, and wailing for the arrival of that 
  Ultimate onto her is as old as Fish Incarnation. Every time he comes here, does some 
  tricks and gets out as soon as his feats are over. But she wants him to be with her, and 
  he escapes from her on politely feigning something, and all this comes mean - you be in 
  your place, I'll be in my place, but I come to you only, only to go from your proximity, 
  as Jean-Paul Sartre prefers to say:L'existence précède et commande l'essence, Existence 
  precedes and rules essence. This is the Indian type of <span class="span1">vyaavhaarika, 
  paaramaarthika satta </span>a colleague at loggerheads, of his 'Being and Nothingness.'</p>
