  &nbsp;Poet Jayadeva wishing to portray the devine love of Raadha and Krishna in his 
  immortal song giita govindam, starts this with a benedictory verse, that 
  indicates the theme of his poetic work, as poets are required to start their 
  poetic works with ashiish, namaskriya, or vastu nirdesha.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;This is the &#39;worm&#39;s-eye-view&#39; of this poetic work, but not the invocation of 
  deity of speech / poetics. The invocation is in next verse.</p>

<p class="comment">

  A parable is said about this verse. As usual with any other poet, Jayadeva was 
  also said to be a twiddler of his thumbs, and seeing this his maternal uncle 
  daunts him for not taking up any job or profession like any other youngster. 
  Jayadeva refuses trivial jobs and declares himself as a poet of par 
  excellence, and he can portray <span class="span1">ayam</span> &#39;that&#39; god in 
  an innovative manner and in off the beaten-track. Then his maternal uncle 
  questions who is &#39;that&#39; god and what is the theme of &#39;that&#39; poetry about 
  &#39;that&#39; god. Then this poem emerged from the depths of heart of Jayadeva about
  <span class="span1">ayam</span>, that god and his sequestered deeds. At the 
  last words of this verse, that uncle sprang up to his feet in ire, and almost 
  said to have stifled Jayadeva to death, for uttering such &#39;blasphemous poetry&#39; 
  on &#39;that&#39; god.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Then Jayadeva, to stand by his own self-declaration as an eminent poet, 
  started to compose the rest of this work, and puts the next verse, an 
  invocatory poem, to stylus. Thus, though unconnected, this poem remained at 
  the head of the work as a prologue, preamble etc., in the pattern of
  <span class="span1">aashiirvaada, vastu nirdehsa, mangala aadiini...</span> 
  &#39;blessings, indicative of the topic of poetry, and for auspicious beginning of 
  the poetic works, which the poets usually employ. Here the love-game of Raadha 
  and Maadhava itself became the auspicious, blessing a priori, and content of 
  this poetic work. That way, without naming him as Krishna, Govinda, or 
  Maadhava etc., the poet puts the pronoun on the tongue of Nanda, the father of 
  Krishna, as <span class="span1">ayam, ayam bhiiruH...</span> on the lines of 
  kaalidasa, in his <span class="span1">kumaara sambhava - 5 - ayam janaaH 
  prahR^iShTa manaaH tapo dhane</span> However, the poet really starts his work 
  with the next verse.</p>

<p class="comment">

  <span class="span1">raadhe</span> said by Nanda has three shades;
  <span class="span1">anunaya vaakya</span> &#39;please Raadha, you take him home, 
  for he is still a boy...&#39; <span class="span1">kopa ukti </span>&nbsp;&#39;said in 
  anger...&#39; &#39;Raadha, don&#39;t you know that he is boyish and naively timorous... 
  when it is dusking and darkening... what is it you play in nights... you go 
  home, and while going take this fellow also to his home... no night 
  wanderings... &#39; <span class="span1">tattva ukti</span> &#39;with some subtext... 
  &#39;Raadha, <span class="span1">tvam eva</span> you alone, <span class="span1">
  gR^iham</span> &#39;house, personified by wife, you on becoming wife...&#39;
  <span class="span1">praapaya </span>&nbsp;&#39;make him prosperous...&#39; &#39;On your account 
  Krishna became a householder, hence you alone lead him forth and enrich his 
  prosperity as a his wife...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">

  Raadha did not get her cherished desire fulfilled in a trice, or at a snap of 
  finger. She had to undergo her historical ordeal, put to test by Krishna. Why 
  should she? When she is willing, when Krishna is at her side, when father 
  Nanda permitted, when her maid encourages her... is she still put to test? 
  These would be the pertinent doubts that arise, though they are not the 
  questions in reality. Yes! She is put to litmus test by this most mischievous 
  Krishna, and she had to shed her tears, sob her sobs, frown her resentments 
  etc. Where all this has happened? On each and every pathway to home, at each 
  and every tree, and in each of the bowers. Krishna seems to be there, but he 
  is actually not there, and he is supposedly unavailable, but his fluting is 
  audible very nearly. So, to depict that a true devotee has to undergo a 
  step-by-step process for the culmination of his/her ardent desire, the poet 
  indicates that there are many a pathway to tread, many are the trees of 
  wisdom, and many are the bowers to contemplate lonely and solitarily, not only 
  for Raadha but to any devotee. All these are godsend gifts of nature and 
  humans.</p>

<p class="comment">

  The clouds spreading on sky will naturally be many. Here the word
  <span class="span1">meghaiH</span> is also in plural, but the commentators 
  limit them to number nine, without the sense of innumerability, and simile 
  them with the nine states, out of the ten states of love-pangs or
  <span class="span1">manmatha avastha-s</span> -</p>

<p class="smrs">

  sleeplessness; 5] shrivelling; 6] disinterestedness in anything; 7]

  The word <span class="span1">ambaram</span> sky suggests &#39;openness, sky is the 
  limit for enjoyment... elate yourselves to sky...&#39; And the word
  <span class="span1">vana bhuva</span> &#39;woodland areas are like heavens, 
  lonely, secluded... thus a secreted heaven is said to be there on earth, on 
  the banks of River Yamuna...&#39; for Krishna is there. And <span class="span1">
  naktam</span> &#39;night time&#39; is the proper time for such activity, since it is 
  forbidden from dawn to dusk. And <span class="span1">yamunaa kuule</span> &#39;on 
  the banks of Yamuna, exciting environ of Yamuna, with breezes wafting coolness 
  of Yamuna waters and fragrances of flowers on its banks. The openness, 
  solitude, rivers, waters, flowers, fragrances, all of them made that place 
  heavenly. Above all, <span class="span1">ayam</span>, &#39;that&#39; god is here. Then 
  what more does a devotee require for his/her dedication, in order to commingle 
  in him - physically, in mortal&#39;s parlance, and psychically in a devotee&#39;s 
  experience.</p>

<p class="comment">

  The use of ultramundane word <span class="span1">maa dhava</span> Lakshmi&#39;s, 
  husband - Vishnu may be observed, even when Krishna is manifestly a mortal, 
  and available just before the eye. Though Krishna is Vishnu and though 
  Rukmini, his first consort, is Lakshmi, Krishna&#39;s longing for an ephemeral and 
  poetic embodiment called Raadha is more, and it suggests that god is inclined 
  more towards real devotees, rather than for his coequals, like Rukmini or 
  Lakshmi and the like.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Aesthetics info for Sanskrit students: The whole work revolves round the 
  following aesthetics. 1] <span class="span1">uddipanaa bhaavaaH</span> 
  excitants of mood: clouds, woodlands, night, arbours and bowers, riverside, 
  cool breezes etc; 2] <span class="span1">aalambana bhaavaaH</span> mood for 
  devotement:Raadha, Yamuna banks, arbours and bowers, solitude etc.; 3]
  <span class="span1">anu bhaava</span> indicatives of mood timorousness, 
  prudishness, coyness of all characters; 4] vybhicaara bhaavaaH deviating moods 
  ecstasy, fear, interestedness, embarrassment etc; 5] <span class="span1">
  sthaayii bhaavaaH</span> common mood longing, desperation, jealousy, 
  resentment etc., with these moods, it is <span class="span1">sambhoga 
  vipralambha sR^ingaara</span> and the metre of this verse is
  <span class="span1">shaarduula vikriiDitam</span> .</p>

<p class="comment">

  Though the moods are available in each of the foot, they may not be brought 
  here, as they do not mean anything these days. But in a prima donna-ish 
  fashion, some are said here. From <span class="span1">meghaiH</span> to
  <span class="span1">praapaya</span> it is <span class="span1">vipralmbha 
  sR^ingaara</span>; <span class="span1">iththam</span> to <span class="span1">
  kelayaH</span> it is <span class="span1">sambhoga sR^ingaara</span>;
  <span class="span1">shyaamaa tamaala, radhaamaadhavoH</span> are in
  <span class="span1">anu praasaa aalnnkaara</span>; first part of verse has
  <span class="span1">samuccaya alankaara</span> while the later part is having
  <span class="span1">ashiir alankaara</span> and on total it is said in
  <span class="span1">samshR^iSTi alankaara</span> . And the first verse itself 
  is indicative of the activities of Krishna, and his playful acts, disporting, 
  or the frolicking that is termed as <span class="span1">raasa liila, raasa 
  kriiDa, krishna liila,</span> which will be heart pleasing.</p>

  &nbsp;This invocation starts with <span class="span1">vaak devataa</span> after 
  Kalidasa&#39;s <span class="span1">vaak arthaav iva sampR^iktau</span> in his epic 
  Kumaarassambhava. In those days, poetic narration about one&#39;s own wife or 
  about her performing arts was a taboo. Jayadeva pooh-poohed this with the 
  above stanza, questioning as to how Satyabhama danced before Krishna, and how 
  Paarvati always dances with always dancing Shiva. Further, devotion does not 
  equate with solitary self-surrender, or by hermetic sainthood, or by murmuring 
  hymns singly. That is for devotees of <span class="span1">nirguNa brahma</span> 
  and this &#39; <span class="span1">bhaagavata</span> devotion&#39; culminates only 
  when <span class="span1">upacaaraa-s</span> &#39;devotional offerings&#39; are 
  offered, and the singing and dancing are the end part of any worship. Even 
  today this custom continues, but only as a lip service, <span class="span1">
  Chatram dhaarayaami, caamaram viijayaami, giita vaadya R^ityam pradashayaami</span> 
  &#39;I hold up an parasol, I fan you, I show dance, sing, play music 
  instruments... oh, god give me what I want...&#39; Instead of worshipping with a 
  dialogue, Jayadeva and Padmaavati danced. It is said the Jayadeva recognised 
  not only a dancer in his wife, but a <span class="span1">bhaagavatii 
  pratipatti</span> &#39;female devotee&#39; in her, and thus both have adored their god 
  jointly.</p>

<p class="comment">

  The analogy between Vaasudeva and Jayadeva is <span class="span1">vasubhiH 
  diipyata iti vaasudeva</span> &#39;one shines forth with his wealth...&#39; If Krishna 
  is resplendent with his charm, Jayadeva is glistening with his wordplay.
  <span class="span1">tasya apatyam vaasudeva</span> &#39;his son is Vaasudeva...&#39; 
  meaning that one who has come out of his indebtedness towards his father, 
  hence a free bird to take his own wings and to flirt as he may. Jayadeva is 
  equally free to flirt away from the orthodoxy of poetics.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;This verse will be at 4th place in North Indian versions and in South, it is 
  as above. The word used <span class="span1">mathura</span> melodious - 
  mellowly, meaning that the words used have <span class="span1">shabda gata, 
  artha gata maadhuryam</span> sound based and meaning based melody. In them 
  sound based melody occurs when harsh sounding consonants like
  <span class="span1">Tha Dha</span> are not used, while the meaning based 
  melody occurs when those words are primarily heat-pleasing, yet a little 
  thinking is necessary to derive their meanings, unlike the words of absolute 
  philosophy, which do not give any satisfaction eve after delving deep into 
  them. Again the <span class="span1">komala</span> has the two aspects of 
  meaning. In them, sound based delicacy occurs when too much of combining 
  vowels and consonants is not adopted as in <span class="span1">nistriaguNya, 
  tymbaka</span> and the like, which usage is called as <span class="span1">
  cakra bandha - padma bandha</span> way of compounding. And the word
  <span class="span1">kaanta</span> is also the same, in that the poetic work is 
  desirable for it has sound based lissomness, and meaning based litheness. The 
  usefulness of this verse is <span class="span1">hari smaraNa, vilaasa vidya 
  sikshaNa</span> meditation on Krishna, and how the coaxing and combing of 
  womenfolk will be delightfully inciting. Thus, this work&#39;s subject matter 
  contains cognizable god in Krishna, if it is mulled over by his cognitive 
  devotees <span class="span1">smaarya smaaraka bhaava; diipaka- alankaara; 
  paancaalii - riiti; kaishikii vR^itti; vR^ittam - dR^ita vilambita</span> With 
  this invocatory poem the poet is embarking on the usual prologues necessary 
  for a poetic work.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;When Vishnu incarnated himself as Vamana he seeks donation of a 
  three-foot-space from Emperor Bali, and Bali being a no naysayer, accords it. 
  Then the dwarf covers entire earth with one foot, entire heaven with the 
  second, and asks Bali where to keep the third. Bali shows his head and the boy 
  places his third foot on the head of Bali, subduing Bali to netherworlds. In 
  doing so, when that dwarf boy raises his foot to cover heavens, his toenail 
  goes straight to the presence of Brahma. Observing that toenail as his father 
  Vishnu&#39;s toenail, Brahma anoints it with sacred waters. When that dwarf-boy 
  withdraws his foot from heaven to place it on Bali&#39;s head, the sacred water on 
  toenail poured by Brahma, rushed onto earth as River Ganga. Here the poet is 
  saying that Bali is being deluded each time in each cycle of eras, as a 
  present continuous action.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Once Bala Rama laid hold of River Yamuna to gratify his desire and when she 
  did not yield he beleaguers her. This is according to mythology. According to 
  water management, he changed the course of her flow by digging a mammoth 
  tunnel with his forceful plough for irrigation purposes. Thus, Yamuna is 
  always fearful of Bala Rama, as she is unaware as to how many more tunnels he 
  is going to dig and alter her course.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;In all the incarnations Vishnu has not taken a selfsame physique excepting in 
  Krishna incarnation. Vishnu will be in his milky abode and Krishna is brought 
  up in a milky environ. Vishnu comfortably reclines on Thousand-hooded serpent, 
  while Krishna has never been in any uncomfortable position like Rama, Parashu 
  Rama, and Vishnu has three wives whereas Krishna is having eight of them, so 
  on and so forth. Hence, the poet is focussing his attention on Krishna alone.
  <span class="span1">alankaara - diipaka; cChandam - kiiti dhavala; shaarduula 
  vikriiDitam</span> is its metre. With this, the auspicious beginning of the 
  poetic work is over and he is entering into the subject matter of this work. 
  In the next verse, the poet is extolling his lead character Krishna&#39;s 
  attributes and endowments. At times some biblical usage of words is adopted, 
  as expressions like &#39;you, your, you will always be doing...&#39; are somehow 
  dissatisfactory.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;At the very start of extolling his hero of his poetic work, the poet has gone 
  straight to the bosomy busts of hero’s consort, and to hear this, it primarily 
  appears to be an erotic word, and if the hearer happens to be an Oedipus, he 
  will be excited even by his mother’s mammaries. But here Goddess Lakshmi is 
  the Supreme Mother and she has Divine mammae, and let millions and millions 
  take birth, she can feed them, indefatigably. Similar is the word used for 
  Lalita in <span class="span1">Lalita sahasra naamaavali</span> -
  <span class="span1">kaThina sthana maNDalaa</span> … as one among many of her 
  motherly attributes.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Here she is abiding in the lotus-like heart of Vishnu, say Krishna, thus 
  undifferentiated are the chests, either as that of a male or as the bust of a 
  female. She is said to be <span class="span1">shrita</span> - whorled around 
  him like a climbing plant onto a tree. So, the poet attempts to distinguish 
  which is which, and says that he is wearing a garland of basil leaves and 
  flowers, which he alone wears, hence recognise him as Krishna. Because he is 
  so tightly embraced by the personified fortune, he is not becoming a pauper 
  and he is even capable of endowing shelter under that absolute fortune to his 
  devotees, called <span class="span1">aashraya - Niiyatvam</span> . So, anyone 
  can seek for his shelter, and he is called <span class="span1">shrayaH patiH</span> 
  - Omni-shelterer, again under the aegis of Goddess Lakshmi. And
  <span class="span1">vanamaala</span> indicates hale and healthiness, thus 
  ready to spring to his feet in the period of crisis, i.e., Omnipotent. 
  Ear-knobs indicate learnedness, for they were accorded according to one’s own 
  scholarliness, called <span class="span1">makara kuNDala, candra kuNDala</span>, 
  like the present day graduate gowns and headgears. Hence, this is indicative 
  of his Omniscience.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Envisioning Krishna from top to toe indicates his supreme and auspicious 
  physique <span class="span1">divya mangala vigraha</span> - besides deified 
  fortune is in his heart. Hence he alone is adorable.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;There is another shade for ‘an ornament to Seetha…’ Rama decorates and 
  paints foliate designs on the body of Seetha, with an erasable tattooing. When 
  Seetha was ill at ease to wear sari of an anchoress, when given by Kaikeyi,

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Why his heart should bless us when he has four hands, of which one is said to 
  be a blessing hand? There will be three items of annihilation, namely disc, 
  mace, and conch in three hands and the fourth is said to be
  <span class="span1">abhaya hasta</span> blessing hand. Is it withdrawn or 
  what? Not so, that blessing hand is symbolic one when he alone functions. Here 
  his chest is now under the auspices of Lakshmi, and thus both of them are 
  blessing - a double blessing. She knows that his heart feels fondness for 
  anyone, but she is unbothered if that fondness is for some devotee. It will be 
  bothersome if this god brings in another ladylove, apart from those that are 
  already available. So, a seal is sealed, <span class="span1">mudritam</span> 
  on his heart with her vermilion mark, <span class="span1">kumkuma, tilaka</span> 
  . By her doubting, we must infer that he has &#39;such a fondness&#39; for not only 
  for Rukmini and Satyabhama and the like, but even more for Raadha.</p>

  &nbsp;The climber plants are feminine and the mango trees are masculine. According 
  to the saying <span class="span1">vanita, kavita, lata, na aashrayam vinaa 
  shobhate -</span> a maid, a poetry, or a tendril cannot possibly outshine

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;This springtime is more bothersome than the bother of separation from their 
  ladyloves, and hence time has predominance on earthlings, may it be humans or 
  others. But humans can quench their desires in drams, and when they can dream 
  about embracing their ladyloves, they can even dream about the all-embracing 
  Krishna. Here Raadha is not advised to be dreamy, but to quickly reach her 
  goal, namely Krishna. Spring is the only season for pastoral poetry and hence 
  it is extolled thus far.<span class="span1"> alankaara - kaavya linga; riiti

  as - innocent, ignorant, artless rhetorical <span class="span1">naayika</span>, 
  artless insofar as romantic advances are concerned. If this black boy and 
  white girl combination is set aside for a while, it is the twosome of 
  devotee-god, trying to achieve oneness, in which the devotee has to make 
  his/her first move to embrace the god, as in <span class="span1">markaTa 
  nyaaya</span> - mother monkey and child monkey syndrome, that contrasts with

  &nbsp;Here the word <span class="span1">raamaam</span> is generative from root
  <span class="span1">ramu - ramu kriiDaayaam</span> - one who gives and takes 
  delight in which she is delighted. This word is on the analogy of the name of 
  Rama in Ramayana. When the syllable ‘a’ is prolonged to ‘aa’ - ‘raa maa’ - it 
  becomes feminine delighter and the delighted. And <span class="span1">smita 
  caaru taraam</span> or, <span class="span1">smita caaru paraam</span> - 
  ‘beamingly smiling’ indicates her readiness for intimacy, expressed in a smile 
  itself. Hence, this piece of poem is floridly smiley. The word
  <span class="span1">vaamaam</span> - is displeased, irritated, peeved, vexed, 
  querulous girl. Even if she were to be so, he can tame her shrewdness and 
  bring her round by going after her. <span class="span1">nayaka - catura</span>

  All these acts are performed sequentially or at a time? At a time only - is 
  the answer. How can one Krishna become many at a time, is its sequel. That is 
  what <span class="span1">raasa kriida</span> or <span class="span1">raasa 
  liila</span> is, and unimaginable are his acts, deeds, or plays of passion. 
  Thus this poetry, though expressed in mundane parlance, attains a supramundane

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;With this the poet concludes this lyric. Here Krishna is <span class="span1">
  adbhuta</span>, because he is manifest separately to each of the milkmaid, in 
  a trice, though remaining himself as one entity. In this lyric the words
  <span class="span1">keli rahasyam</span> are usually translated as secrets 
  sports, or secret love-games etc., taking them to be <span class="span1">
  rahasya keli kalaapam</span>, but the word <span class="span1">rahasyam</span> 
  qualifies the word <span class="span1">keli</span> . Then they are the secrets 
  about those plays, of which the poet wishes to tell, but not how secretly the 
  plays are played, and Krishna is no covert player, either in these dance 
  dramas of Bhaagavata or in the politics of Maha Bhaarata. <span class="span1">

  Blinded by her love for Krishna, Raadha drew nigh of him, who is among 
  vivacious milkmaids with curvy eyebrows, and who are replete with rejoice 
  while in ronde dancing, but Raadha ardently hugged his chest among all of 
  them, and enthusiastically said thus, &quot;Your face is nectareous...thus your 
  singing must be nectarean...come sing now... &quot; And then, on the pretext of 
  eulogising his singing, she started to kiss him, and he who is thus kissed by 
  Raadha is all smiles for her, and he who steals hearts with his beaming 
  smiles, that Krishna may save our souls... [1-13]</p>

  &nbsp;In this lyric <span class="span1">sringaara - vipralambha; naayika 
  -pragalbha; naayaka - mugdha;</span> the manner of hugging is called
  <span class="span1">vR^iksha adhiruuDha</span> - tree-climbing embrace -
  <span class="span1">tarum iva kamitaaram cumbana aartaa adhi roDhum 
  yadabhilaSati naarii tat ca vR^ikshaadhiruuDham</span>; the kissing style is 
  called <span class="span1">namitaka</span> - where milkmaids are happy enough 
  with kissing and kisses - <span class="span1">abhiirajaaH cumbana haarya 
  cittaaH; alankaara - aashiis, aprastuta prasanga, vyaajoktiu, aakshepa, hetu;</span> 
  since Raadha advanced, some heroine&#39;s bravery is there - <span class="span1">
  naayika utsaaha ruupa viira rasa; anuvritti - aarabhaTi; riiti - paancaali; 
  giiti -artha maagadhi; gaana - sthiti laya;</span> Its metre is
  <span class="span1">shaarduula vikriiDitam</span> .</p>
