   Chapter [Sarga] 11 - s<span class="span2">aanandadaamodaram</span></p>
<p class="itrsloka">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="tat">Now Raadha approaches Krishna, somehow reconciling herself about 
 Krishna's frolicking with other maids, at the persuasion of her girlfriends. There 
 are many variations in&nbsp; of this&nbsp; chapter in other mms, and hence the verses found 
 more may be taken as regional insurgencies.<br>

<p class="tat">On coaxing Raadha for a long time and gladdening her Krishna dressed 
 up in a befitting manner to receive her, and awaited her on a couch in a bower, and 
 Raadha too, when the eye-dimming duskily late evening is gleamy, decorated herself 
 with a black smock-frock like dress and black blanket, and suchlike befitting 
 apparels required in meeting her lover, and to such a un-dispirited Raadha, some 
 milkmaid spoke in this way. [11-1]</p>

<p class="comment">Some other milkmaid encourages Raadha when her 
 dispiritedness is alleviated by Krishna, as she was so reluctant to others so far. 
 This episode is the reported speech of other milkmaids and that of the poet, in 
 explaining how a coyly girl is abashed to meet her man on the first day, and such 
 scenes are usual even to day at nuptials.</p>

<p class="comment">

&nbsp;The simile/metaphors used here are between:– waves – pearl-pendants; purls of love – purl-like motion of pendant on 
  heaving bosoms; water spills only if brook/stream is full; love spill only when it is bosom-full; stream with full immaculate 
  water – bosoms with plethoric pristine love; pot like bosoms – streams with pot and pots of water; Love-god&#39;s activity 
  is seasonal – longing for love is time oriented; and the upsurge and getting tide-ripped is common to both water and love.</p>

<p class="comment">

  When it is said <span class="span1">ananga taranga</span> it is construed that Raadha is <span class="span1">rasa tarangiNi</span> 
  a purl of essence of enjoyable, blissful love purl of Krishna, where purl is a stream of a brook etc., flowing with a swelling, 
  swirling motion and babbling sound. She too is a single stream of loveliest love essence. And when the bosoms of women 
  surge with passion, of course in with a righteous intention, then the swell of bosoms portend a definite embrace from their 
  loved men. <span class="span1">nityam naaryaaH stane kampaH priya sangama suucakaH – shakuna shaastra</span> Then Raadha 
  may say &#39;stop all this orthodox nonsense, how can I go to him when all of you are eyeing at me, am I shameless or what?&#39;
