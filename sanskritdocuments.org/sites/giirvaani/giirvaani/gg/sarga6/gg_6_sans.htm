<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 6 - Inconsiderate Krishna</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="tat">Raadha&#39;s friend returns to Krishna to inform about the ecstatic state 
of Raadha.</p>

<p class="tat">Then the girlfriend of Raadha, on coming to Raadha from Krishna, 
and on seeing Raadha who is still dawdling in the same bower, and uncompliant to 
go to Krishna immediately, that girlfriend again returned to Krishna, and started 
to tell clearly about that episode of Raadha&#39;s unyieldingness. [6-1]</p>

secret swiller of nectar from the lips of other milkmaids, in all directions... 
thus, Rādha&nbsp; is aweary in an arbour...</p>

<p class="comment">Here the poet uses a pun for the word <span class="span1">naatha 
hare</span> meaning an impetuous bull roped at nose for restraining its impetuosity.
<span class="span1">naadham = naasaa rajjum, harati = gR^ihNaati, iti naadha hari</span> 
&#39;when Rādha&nbsp; is patiently waiting in that bower, your not coming to her is 
bullish, hence you are not only a <span class="span1">gopala</span>, but also a 
horny bull...&#39; Then he may ask &#39;why she is so touchy, she could have come here...&#39; 
for this she is saying as below.</p>

falls... hence, Rādha&nbsp; is aweary in an arbour... [a pa 12-2]</p>

<p class="tat">Vividly: This song is a choreographer&#39;s&#39; delight: She walks a few 
steps, but your infidelity comes to her mind and she stops, but takes some more 
steps, your duplicity comes to her mind and she stops, yet after some more steps 
your chicanery reminds her to stop... in this back and forth dance-stepping, her 
steps stumble and she tumbles... yet she is somehow living but for thinking on you...&#39; 
from choreographers viewpoint. How she is &#39;living&#39; is said next.</p>

[a pa 12-4]</p>

<p class="tat">Vividly. She looks at her ornaments to examine whether they are befitting 
for a meeting with you. She adjusts them to look better. In doing so, she unwittingly 
adjusts head ornament as peacock feather, puts some dangling earring as your knobbly 
earrings, holds her strings of pearls or a necklace as your flute, and so on. And 
then on seeing herself like that she declares &#39;I am Krishna...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">Here the core subject of this work is posted. Raadha not only 
identifies herself with Krishna, but also declares that she is Krishna. Other non-romantic 
characters like Seetha, Savitri et al appears to not have averred like this, except 
divinity like <font color="#800000">naaraayaNi</font> -<font color="#800000"> aham

<p class="comment">It is quite common for anyone to get shivers and shudders if 
drenched in cold for a long time. Then they articulate shivers owing to their freezing 
cold. Here, the situation is reverse. The body is burning with desire, and she is 
deluged in an ocean, which is like molten lava. Then her shivers and shudders shall 
be more than ordinary cold caught person.</p>

<p class="comment">The stolidity occurred to her is the <span class="span1">jaDatva</span> 
the fifth sate in aesthetics of love <span class="span1">manmatha avastha</span> 
The a feeling called <span class="span1">haava</span> is caused and that
<span class="span1">haava</span> is called <span class="span1">kuTTamita</span> 
. The causing scene for <span class="span1">kuTTamita haava</span> to a heroine 
is as like this: <span class="span1">kesha adhara aadi grahaNe mudamaanaa api maanase

<p class="comment">A word about this treatise <span class="span1">rasaarNava sudhaakaram</span> 
This is written by <span class="span1">simhabhuupaala</span>, an erstwhile Telugu 
king. This book perhaps is ill fated to be republished and remained in the shelves 
of archives. But this is made available per kindness of <span class="span1">Gaudiya 
Grantha Mandir</span>, in bare Sanskrit text, at <span class="span1">granthamandira.org</span> 
with an assurance &#39;a separate edition with examples will be offered soon - Jan Brzezinski...&#39; 
In this book the situations to use words <span class="span1">kitava, dhuurta</span> 
are also incorporated. But they are not elaborated here. Next, this girlfriend hurries 
Krishna to reach Rādha, before it is too late.</p>

<p class="tat">Vividly: Rādha&nbsp; is asking Krishna to come to a particular place 
for their pleasure tripping. But she cannot tell it directly to Krishna as his father 
Nanda and others are there tending cattle. In the meanwhile she caught sight of 
a traveller tarrying under a banyan tree. She immediately yelled at him saying, 
&quot;Oh, traveller, why do you take respite under that banyan tree with holes in its 
trunk into which black cobras truck in and out... oh, brother, won&#39;t you see that 
house of Nanda, a happiest hospice... please go there for a boundless hospitality... 
[aside: but leave that tree at once... for it is our preset retreat, and it shall 
serve as a happy abode for Krishna, the enjoyer...&quot;] This song containing such words 
of Rādha, impregnated with inner meaning in inviting an evening time-invitee, shall 
be paramountly devotional... so sayest poet Jayadeva... [6-4]</p>
