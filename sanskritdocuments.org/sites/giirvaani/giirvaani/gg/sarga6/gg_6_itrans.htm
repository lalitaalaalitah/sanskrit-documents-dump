  Then the girlfriend of Raadha, on coming to Raadha from Krishna, and on seeing 
  Raadha who is still dawdling in the same bower, and uncompliant to go to 
  Krishna immediately, that girlfriend again returned to Krishna, and started to

<p class="comment">

  Comment: Here the poet uses a pun for the word <strong>naatha hare </strong>
  meaning an impetuous bull roped at nose for restraining its impetuosity.
  <strong>naadham = naasaa rajjum, harati = gR^ihNaati, iti naadha hari</strong> 
  'when Raadha is patiently waiting in that bower your not coming to her is 
  bullish, hence you are not only a <font color="#800000">gopala</font>, but 
  also a horny bull...' Then he may ask 'why she is so touchy, she could have 
  come here...' for this she is saying as below.</p>

  stops, but takes some more steps, your duplicity stops her, yet after some 
  more steps your chicanery reminds her to stop... in this back and forth

  Vividly. She looks at her ornaments to examine whether they are befitting for 
  a meeting with you. She adjusts them to look better. In doing so, she 
  unwittingly adjusts head ornament as peacock feather, puts some dangling 
  earring as your knobbly earrings, holds her strings of pearls or a necklace as 
  your flute, and so on. And then on seeing herself like that she declares 'I am 
  Krishna...'</p>

<p class="comment">

  Here the core subject of this work is posted. Raadha not only identifies 
  herself with Krishna, but also declares that she is Krishna. Other 
  non-romantic characters like Seetha, Savitri et al appears to not have averred 
  like this, except divinity like <font color="#800000">naaraayaNi</font> -<font color="#800000">

  Comment: The word <font color="#800000">vaasaka sajjika</font> is a name to 
  the romantic heroine waiting for her hero, and the poet uses this word for

<p class="comment">

  It is quite common for anyone to get shivers and shudders if drenched in cold 
  for a long time. Then they articulate shivers owing to their freezing cold. 
  Here, the situation is reverse. The body is burning with desire, and she is 
  deluged in an ocean, which is like molten lava. Then her shivers and shudders 
  shall be more than ordinary cold caught person.</p>

  The stolidity occurred to her is the <span class="span1">jaDatva </span>the

  A word about this treatise <span class="span1">rasaarNava sudhaakaram </span>
  This is written by Simhabhuupaala, an erstwhile Telugu king. This book perhaps 
  is ill fated to be republished and remained in the shelves of archives. But 
  this is made available per kindness of Gaudiya Grantha Mandir, in bare 
  Sanskrit text, at <span class="span1">granthamandira.org </span>with an 
  assurance 'a separate edition with examples will be offered soon - Jan 
  Brzezinski...' In this book the situations to use words <span class="span1">
  kitava, dhuurta </span>are also incorporated. But they are not elaborated 
  here. Next this girl hurries Krishna to reach Raadha, before it is too late.</p>

  Hoping that no more pedantry is required here, we go to next verse, which is a 
  benedictory conclusion unseen in many other mms. On this below mentioned verse 
  the commentator of <span class="span1">rasamanjari </span>has not commented, 
  but one commentator known as <span class="span1">kumbhakarNa </span>has

  Vividly. Raadha is asking Krishna to come to a particular place for their 
  pleasure tripping. But she cannot tell it directly to Krishna as his father 
  Nanda and others are there tending cattle. In the meanwhile she caught sight 
  of a traveller tarrying under a banyan tree. She immediately yelled at him 
  saying, &quot;Oh, traveller, why do you take respite under that banyan tree with 
  holes in its trunk into which black cobras truck in and out... oh, brother, 
  won't you see that house of Nanda, a happiest hospice... please go there for a 
  boundless hospitality... [aside: but leave that tree at once... for it is our 
  preset retreat, and it shall serve as a happy abode for Krishna, the 
  enjoyer...&quot;] containing such words of Raadha, impregnated with inner meaning 
  in inviting an evening time invitee, either a traveller or a beguiler, this 
  song shall be paramountly devotional... so sayest poet Jayadeva... [6-5]</p>
