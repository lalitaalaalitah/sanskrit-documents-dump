<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 5 - Passionate Krishna</h3>
<p class="tat">

  Raadha's friend comes back to Raadha and narrates how Krishna is lovelorn as 
  Raadha left abruptly. The poet dwells on 'anguish in separation'
  <span class="span1">vipralambha shR^ingaara</span><font color="#B3003A">
  </font>from the first chapter to tenth, and in eleventh and twelth he unifies 
  the hero and heroine of the song. That mood of anguishful separation will be 
  heightened from now on.<br>

  The stanzas at 5, 6, and 7 do not appear in Mumbai, or in northern editions. 
  As they are without eight sub-songs, this whole song is said to be an 
  interpolation, to which southern versions further interpolate three sub-songs,

<p class="comment">

  Whoever wants a final release meditates on far away place, preferably on a 
  riverbank and in a bower, preferring solitude in ascesis. This is as said in
  <span class="span1">manjuuSa: gR^ihe goSTana aaraama nadii naga sura aalaye | 
  anugrahaat guroH siddiH shiighram syaat uttarottam </span>'in a solitary 
  place, cowshed, forest, gardens, on riverbanks, seashore, in temples if hymns 
  are chanted, one can attain his moksha, with the blessings of his teacher...' 
  Here, Krishna is compared with a meditator, Raadha his goddess, her various 
  chitchatting as hymns to her, and the finality of his meditation culminates in 
  an embrace, which itself is moksha through supreme love.</p>

  Here Raadha is said to be goldenly yellow indicating the initially yellowish

  will be above clouds, and cranes will be below clouds. Here Krishna is below, 
  over whom pendants are dangling, above which Raadha is beaming forth like

  hugging, a sort of 'fear' is occurring <span class="span1">bhaya sthaayii

  coaxing and combing, kissing and scratching is started, hence she should be in

  <span class="span1">ta rasa</span>, which leads to contented smiling, which 
  gives rise even to laughter. It is <span class="span1">haasa sahita haasya 
  rasa</span>.</p>

<p class="comment">

  This verse opens with the very words and the step-by-step eightfold enjoyment, 
  as Bharata says in <span class="span1">naaTya shaastra: aaSleSa cumbana nakha 
  kshata kaama bodha shiighratva maithunam ananta mukha prabodham | priitiH tato 
  api rasa bhaavanam eva kaaryam evam nitaanta caturaaH suciram ramante ||
  </span>. Of course, there is opposition to the eightfold course of enjoyment, 
  but it is negated, taking the saying of aesthetician called Rudra
  <span class="span1">iirSyaa kula striiSu na naayakasya niH shanka keliH na 
  paraa anganaasu </span>'jealousy in a chaste woman, men's unrestrained 
  indulgence in other's women are taboos...'</p>

<p class="comment">

  All this is for licentious human couples, but not in respect of higher gods or 
  lower animals, because humans alone can enjoy aesthetic pleasure
  <span class="span1">rasa aasvaadana</span>, which facility is nonexistent in 
  others kinds of existence. And here Raadha's friend is quoting from her human 
  experience, and through Jayadeva's poetic expertise. So, nothing can be 
  ascribed to role-players like nonexistent poetic characters, or those with 
  supra existence, i.e., divine couple. This is only to remind the poetic 
  ability of Jayadeva.</p>

  &quot;O, pretty-faced Raadha, Krishna being an unique Prince Charming, will find 
  you out, while you advance to him casting your fearful glances wincingly on 
  your unenlightened path, walking gracefully on that indiscernibly darkened 
  pathway, watching your own step, and while pausing awhile at every foot of a 
  tree, either by your hesitation, or by your graceful footwork, and you with 
  passional tiderips like limbs of yours, if you somehow reach him, even if in 
  unknowable secrecy, even if it is an unknown darkness, he certainly sees you, 
  and let him achieve that consummation on your reaching him...</p>

<p class="comment">

  the philo-ing giita govindam is avowedly not taken up in this work; but it is 
  to be incorporated induced by the itching commentaries. This has two shades. 
  One belongs dancers and the other to devotees. Keeping dancers side away for a 
  while, on devotee's side it is like this. Krishna has not come to Raadha but 
  asked her friend to fetch her to him, only to examine her devotedness. That 
  being so, here it is said, 'he sees you...' taking the word
  <span class="span1">dR^ishau </span>and the root for this word is
  <span class="span1">dR^ishi </span>meaning 'discern' <span class="span1">
  vivakshita j~naana arthakatvam </span>a kind of gnosis... 'You can 
  'Gnosticise' him and he does the same, if only you come into union with him, 
  first psychically, then bodily. To achieve that you have to fearfully wince 
  you glances in searching for him in the wild darkness of unenlightened state. 
  You have to tread an unenlightened path, where unenlightened path is - 
  physically a darksome way, and in the sense 'give spiritual insight to (a 
  person)...' you have to have your own enlightenment to search for him in the 
  dark... you have watch your step otherwise you may misstep, pause it at each 
  tree of knowledge to learn more about that object you search... and then you 
  should have a graceful footwork, lest your running, rushing, and racing will 
  appear as your greediness and it would result into futility... this is as far 
  as spiritual mind is concerned - <span class="span1">ahamta </span>I-ness'. 
  Then all your bodily limbs, for whose passional tiderips sake you are staging 
  all this drama, they shall be surrendered unto him, and let them merge into 
  one colliding tiderip called universal love. Much more is there, but leave it 
  as it may. Here ends the 5th chapter in northern mms. Southerners have another 
  verse as below.</p>
