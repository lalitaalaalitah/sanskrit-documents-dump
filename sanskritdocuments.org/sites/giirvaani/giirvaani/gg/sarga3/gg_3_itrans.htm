  Even Krishna refrained from the beauties of Vraj, retaining Raadha

  worldly life, with nostalgic reminiscences of his earlier birth. 
  [3-1]</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;If one can enjoy the love of Raadha, he will be shackled to live in 
  this world under love-bondage. When a departed soul cannot find any 
  'love' in heavens or other worlds, where gods adore and admire each 
  other, and seraphically enjoy their divinity, minus any quotient of 
  living, called love, that soul retains nostalgic reminiscences of 
  this love, and takes a rebirth longing for that love.</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Here, by saying the 'prosperity' his <span class="span1">shriyaH 
  patitvam </span>'the possessor of Goddess Lakshmi' is suggested. And 
  by the word 'people' his <span class="span1">prajaa patitvam </span>
  'the mastership of living beings' in leading them in and out of 
  mortality is suggested. And with word 'house' <span class="span1">
  bhuu patitvam </span>'lordship of abodes' is suggested. There is 
  another variant as <span class="span1">mama kim gR^iheNa sukhena
  </span>'even if riches are there, what is the use with a house or 
  other comforts without Raadha...' would be its import.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Here we have to dwell a little while on <span class="span1">rasa 
  siddhaanta </span>'Treatises on Aesthetic Pleasure...' where romance 
  is but on expressible component.</p>

<p class="comment">

  A psychological theory that is a peculiarly Indian contribution is 
  that of <span class="span1">rasa</span>, which is very often though 
  wrongly, translated as sentiment. Rasa is aesthetic pleasure, which 
  is said to be akin to the sublime bliss of God. The writers of
  <span class="span1">alankaara </span>[rhetoric, poetics] follow the 
  Upanishadic view generally, and say that rasa is one and is Brahman. 
  But it can take different forms, which are usually accepted as nine, 
  corresponding to nine <span class="span1">bhaavaa-s </span>
  [emotions, sentiment]. <span class="span1">bhaavaa-s </span>are of 
  two kinds, <span class="span1">sthayii bhaava </span>'stable' 
  bhaavaa-s and <span class="span1">sancaarii bhaavaa-s </span>or 
  unstable bhaavaa-s. It is the former that can become
  <span class="span1">rasa</span>. They are <span class="span1">
  sringaara </span>love, <span class="span1">viira </span>heroism,
  <span class="span1">karuNa </span>pity, <span class="span1">adbhuta
  </span>wonder, <span class="span1">haasya </span>laughter,
  <span class="span1">bhhayaanaka </span>dread, <span class="span1">
  bhiibhatsa </span>disgust, <span class="span1">raudra </span>fury,
  <span class="span1">shaanta </span>quiet or peace. At their base lie 
  the corresponding dominant feelings of <span class="span1">rati
  </span>sexual craving, <span class="span1">utsaaha </span>energy,
  <span class="span1">shoka </span>sorrow, <span class="span1">vismaya
  </span>astonishment, <span class="span1">haasa </span>mirth,
  <span class="span1">bhaya </span>fear, <span class="span1">jugupsa
  </span>aversion, <span class="span1">krodha </span>anger,
  <span class="span1">nirveda </span>self-disparagement, which must be 
  assisted by favourable excitants <span class="span1">vi bhaava-s</span>, 
  both <span class="span1">aalambana </span>essential,
  <span class="span1">uddiipana </span>enhancing, by reinforcing 
  ensuants <span class="span1">anu bhaava</span>, namely, voluntary 
  and <span class="span1">saatvika bhaava-s</span> expressions and 
  also by certain accessories or subordinate feelings
  <span class="span1">sancaarii bhaava-s, vybhicaarii bhaavaas </span>
  which follow in the wake of the dominant sentiments and diversify 
  themselves. - The Cultural Heritage of India, Vol. III, The 
  Philosophies.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Thus the explanations expand and expand. When it is said as 'he is 
  appearing like an embodiment of romance... at 1-11, it is Krishna's 
  personification, with which all milkmaids enjoyed all the aesthetic 
  pleasures endowed by him. Some of the many ensuants of this savoury 
  called aesthetic pleasure are noted here. <span class="span1">

  enhanced by <span class="span1">saattvika bhaara </span>then it 
  shines forth as <span class="span1">shR^ingaara rasa</span>. And

  The <span class="span1">vyabhicaarii bhaavaaH </span>- a word need

  reminiscing, self-confidence, happiness, astonishment, hilarity, 
  shyness, craziness, slight fear, sadness, stolidity, sleepiness, 
  uneasiness are the feeling in pleasing romanticism.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Then the <span class="span1">shR^ingaara saattvika bhaavaaH </span>

<p class="comment">

  'As <span class="span1">shR^ingaara </span>has two aspects viz.,
  <span class="span1">samyoga </span>[union] and <span class="span1">
  vi yoga </span>[separation,] there are two stages in this
  <span class="span1">rasa, [rasa anubhuuti] </span>, which the 
  devotees enjoy. One in his company as they are in union with him, 
  while the other in his absence they suffer the misery of separation 
  and think of him all the time, so much so that they cannot see or 
  experience anything but Krishna. According to some, the stage of 
  separation is therefore superior to that of union.' - The Cultural 
  Heritage of India. Vol. III, Philosophies.</p>

<p class="comment">

  Coming to our mainstay, Krishna also has a longing feeling for his 
  devotees, personified here as Raadha, whom he once neglected. Here 
  he is in the state of <span class="span1">smaraNa avastha </span>
  'reminiscing' his wrongdoing and her resent. Doesn't matter. A 
  wrongdoer has a right to beg excuses, entwining threads and laces of 
  many stories, at anytime. Let him do so, but first let him 
  soliloquize what he has to say or feel for Raadha.</p>

  &nbsp;'I muse on that face...' finishes with a word 'bemusedly...' It is

  &nbsp;This is said to be a grand poetic construct. Unlike the doubtful 
  expression of Kalidasa as at, <span class="span1">kaH suuryaH 
  prabhavo vamshaH? </span>Jayadeva is self-assertive in asserting 
  that though he came from a small village, he will be a moon in 
  starry poetry, raising from earth to skyward like the ocean-born 
  moon. This village Bindubilva, or Kendubilva, or Kenduli is said to 
  be in Utkala area. If Utkala historically belongs to Vanga desha it 
  is in Bengal. Else, it is in Orisaa.</p>

  &quot;Those comfortable touches are still lasting, also those flirtations

  taste are still immutable from memory, and though no single sense 
  organ is dissatisfied, as each is still enjoying the good old 
  comfort, but my heart is longing for her, in spite of the fact that 
  hearts usually long after someone or something, an unavailable 
  satisfying factor... this is amazingly self-contradictory, as it 
  happens only in 'love...' [3-8]</p>

  &nbsp;If it is asked 'is it enough that the satisfaction of sensory 
  organs is simply sufficient, leaving the motor organs? For this it 
  is replied 'motor organs are subservient to sensory organs, as they 
  cannot perform actions on their own... further, the classification
