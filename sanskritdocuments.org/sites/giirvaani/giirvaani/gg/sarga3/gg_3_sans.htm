<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 3 - Winsome Krishna</h3>

<p class="tat">

  On establishing Raadha's sincere longing for Krishna in the earlier 
  chapter, now the poet commences this chapter to show how Krishna 
  feels for her, in an equal yearning.</span></p>

  Even Krishna refrained from the beauties of Vraj, retaining Raadha 
  in his heart, as though she is like his shackle-like bondage in this 
  worldly life, with nostalgic reminiscences of his earlier birth. 
  [3-1]</span></p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;If one can enjoy the love of Raadha, he will be shackled to live in 
  this world under love-bondage. When a departed soul cannot find any 
  'love' in heavens or other worlds, where gods adore and admire each 
  other, and seraphically enjoy their divinity, minus any quotient of 
  living, called love, that soul retains nostalgic reminiscences of 
  this love, and takes a rebirth longing for that love.</span></p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Here, by saying the 'prosperity' his </span><span class="span1">
  shriyaH patitvam </span></span>'the possessor of Goddess Lakshmi' is 
  suggested. And by the word 'people' his </span><span class="span1">
  prajaa patitvam </span></span>'the mastership of living beings' in 
  leading them in and out of mortality is suggested. And with word 
  'house' </span><span class="span1">bhuu patitvam </span></span>
  'lordship of abodes' is suggested. There is another variant as
  </span><span class="span1">mama kim gR^iheNa sukhena </span></span>
  'even if riches are there, what is the use with a house or other 
  comforts without Raadha...' would be its import.</span></p>

<p class="comment">

  Here we have to dwell a little while on </span><span class="span1">
  rasa siddhaanta </span></span>'Treatises on Aesthetic Pleasure...' 
  where romance is but on expressible component.</span></p>

<p class="comment">

  A psychological theory that is a peculiarly Indian contribution is 
  that of </span><span class="span1">rasa</span></span>, which is very 
  often though wrongly, translated as sentiment. Rasa is aesthetic 
  pleasure, which is said to be akin to the sublime bliss of God. The 
  writers of </span><span class="span1">alankaara </span></span>
  [rhetoric, poetics] follow the Upanishadic view generally, and say 
  that rasa is one and is Brahman. But it can take different forms, 
  which are usually accepted as nine, corresponding to nine </span>
  <span class="span1">bhaavaa-s </span></span>[emotions, sentiment].
  </span><span class="span1">bhaavaa-s </span></span>are of two kinds,
  </span><span class="span1">sthayii bhaava </span></span>'stable' 
  bhaavaa-s and </span><span class="span1">sancaarii bhaavaa-s </span>
  </span>or unstable bhaavaa-s. It is the former that can become
  </span><span class="span1">rasa</span></span>. They are </span>
  <span class="span1">sringaara </span></span>love, </span>
  <span class="span1">viira </span></span>heroism, </span>
  <span class="span1">karuNa </span></span>pity, </span>
  <span class="span1">adbhuta </span></span>wonder, </span>
  <span class="span1">haasya </span></span>laughter, </span>
  <span class="span1">bhhayaanaka </span></span>dread, </span>
  <span class="span1">bhiibhatsa </span></span>disgust, </span>
  <span class="span1">raudra </span></span>fury, </span>
  <span class="span1">shaanta </span></span>quiet or peace. At their 
  base lie the corresponding dominant feelings of </span>
  <span class="span1">rati </span></span>sexual craving, </span>
  <span class="span1">utsaaha </span></span>energy, </span>
  <span class="span1">shoka </span></span>sorrow, </span>
  <span class="span1">vismaya </span></span>astonishment, </span>
  <span class="span1">haasa </span></span>mirth, </span>
  <span class="span1">bhaya </span></span>fear, </span>
  <span class="span1">jugupsa </span></span>aversion, </span>
  <span class="span1">krodha </span></span>anger, </span>
  <span class="span1">nirveda </span></span>self-disparagement, which 
  must be assisted by favourable excitants </span><span class="span1">
  vi bhaava-s</span></span>, both </span><span class="span1">aalambana
  </span></span>essential, </span><span class="span1">uddiipana </span>
  </span>enhancing, by reinforcing ensuants </span>
  <span class="span1">anu bhaava</span></span>, namely, voluntary and
  </span><span class="span1">saatvika bhaava-s</span>expressions and 
  also by certain accessories or subordinate feelings </span>
  <span class="span1">sancaarii bhaava-s, vybhicaarii bhaavaas </span>
  </span>which follow in the wake of the dominant sentiments and 
  diversify themselves. - The Cultural Heritage of India, Vol. III, 
  The Philosophies.</span></p>

<p class="comment">

  Thus the explanations expand and expand. When it is said as 'he is 
  appearing like an embodiment of romance... at 1-11, it is Krishna's 
  personification, with which all milkmaids enjoyed all the aesthetic 
  pleasures endowed by him. Some of the many ensuants of this savoury 
  called aesthetic pleasure are noted here. </span>

  a word need be said about this word. The usage of this word is now

<p class="comment">

  'As </span><span class="span1">shR^ingaara </span></span>has two 
  aspects viz., </span><span class="span1">samyoga </span></span>
  [union] and </span><span class="span1">vi yoga </span></span>
  [separation,] there are two stages in this </span>
  <span class="span1">rasa, [rasa anubhuuti] </span></span>, which the 
  devotees enjoy. One in his company as they are in union with him, 
  while the other in his absence they suffer the misery of separation 
  and think of him all the time, so much so that they cannot see or 
  experience anything but Krishna. According to some, the stage of 
  separation is therefore superior to that of union.' - The Cultural 
  Heritage of India. Vol. III, Philosophies.</span></p>

<p class="comment">

  Coming to our mainstay, Krishna also has a longing feeling for his 
  devotees, personified here as Raadha, whom he once neglected. Here 
  he is in the state of </span><span class="span1">smaraNa avastha
  </span></span>'reminiscing' his wrongdoing and her resent. Doesn't 
  matter. A wrongdoer has a right to beg excuses, entwining threads 
  and laces of many stories, at anytime. Let him do so, but first let 
  him soliloquize what he has to say or feel for Raadha.</span></p>

  &nbsp;'I muse on that face...' finishes with a word 'bemusedly...' It is 
  his bounden duty to incite her, not to a resentment or anger, but to 
  a full-fledged choleric state. Otherwise he will not have a chance 
  to beg pardon. A lotus sways many times when jolted by a honeybee, 
  and in doing so its petals widen and contract. Here the bee 
  agitating Raadha is the buzzing thought of Krishna, knitted eyebrows 
  are knitting/opening petals, and reddish lotus like face of

  taste are still immutable from memory, and though no single sense 
  organ is dissatisfied, as each is still enjoying the good old

  &nbsp;If it is asked 'is it enough that the satisfaction of sensory

  cannot perform actions on their own... further, the classification 
  of motor organs is varied and numerous... hence, leave them as they 
  are...'</span></p>

  kshemam dadatu=</span>impunity, let give.</p>

<p class="tat">

  He whose neck is slanted transversely, whose head is nodding tossing 
  his headgear, while that Krishna started to sound off his transverse 
  flute, Mohana Vamshi, in a higher octave, and then his highly 
  infatuating looks that have sprouted in the moon like face of 
  Raadha, enjoying the luscious and nectarean essence of such a face 
  for a long-time, are now not aiming at those thousands of milkmaids, 
  who have come again to listen his fluting, as those looks are 
  searching for Raadha... let those gracing ripples like sidelong 
  glances endow us impunity in all our actions... [3-9]</span></p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;This verse will not be found in northern mms, hence the problem 
  with the construct of </span><span class="span1">na sa.mlakshitaaH
  </span></span>may not be observed. This is available in the 
  publication of Gurudev Ranade Institute of Philo and Mysticism, 
  Benguluru. There seems to be a riddle in that, and if any scholars 
  can inform the correct construction, this will be amended.</span></p>
