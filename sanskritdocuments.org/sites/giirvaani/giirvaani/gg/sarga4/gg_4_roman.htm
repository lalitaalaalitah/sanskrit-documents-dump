  Raadha's friend is now approaching him, who has came to another 
  bower and staying at it indolently, for he could not find Raadha 
  even after a through search, hence he is perplexed as he is 
  overwhelmed by his love for Raadha, and to such a Krishna, she says 
  the following details.</p>

  her realm of imagination you are unseen... and seen are the arrowy 
  beams of moon, and envenomed sandal-scent of breeze, thus she 
  desperately and despondently reckons both the moon and sandal-scent 
  as the agents of that Love-god, thus she loathes and reviles all of 
  them, but for you... thus, now she is lovelorn, and unbefitting is

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;This famous song contains two tones, one that of a tongue-lashing 
  of a friend, with somewhat harsh words of milkmaid,
  <span class="span1">niSTura vaakya, nindaa vaacka </span>which is 
  limitable only to text. Its construal is: <span class="span1">
  candanam kaamam adhikam iirayati; tava bhaavanayaa, tava 
  saakshaatkaareNa, tayi liinaa...</span> etc. Moreover, the other 
  tone is the entreaty of a devotee, with <span class="span1">stuti 
  vaakya, praardhanaa vaakya</span><strong> </strong>devotional 
  eulogy, extolling, praise song, which is tunefully adopted by 
  singers with most piteous requisition to comeback to Raadha. The 
  reprise in this song is only for words <span class="span1">saa 
  virahe tava diinaa... saa tava virahe diinaa...</span><strong>
  </strong>'she is lovelorn, without you...' but many take some more 
  lines, unnecessarily.</p>

  &quot;She that Raadha is making a coat of mail with the sprays of wide 
  and wet lotus petals, in the innermost recesses of her heart, 
  against the incessantly darting arrows of Love-god targeting her 
  it... methinks... maybe to safeguard you who are snugly settled in

  &quot;Hè, Krishna, you know how delicate is Raadha's heart, and targeting 
  it Love-god is incessantly flinging fiery flowery arrows, but 
  uncaring for herself she is bravely preparing a lotus-petal shield, 
  like that of a leathern or metallic shield used by brave warriors, 
  only to protect you, as she ensconced you in the innermost recesses 
  of her heart... and those petals are wide enough to cover you, and 
  wet enough, for they are wet with water and with her love as well, 
  to give enough resistance to you from their heat... hence, she is 
  lovelorn, and unbefitting is your leaving her in the lurch... [a pa

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;This girl Raadha has a sense of delicacy. Usually devotees arrange 
  a small golden or silver throne to gods in their worship rooms, and 
  place an idol on it, and run the rote of what they have learnt. 
  Here, she is making a flowery bed to give painless seating, and a 
  seat collapsible even as a bed, if he wants to repose. Stones 
  replaced the thrones of gods in temples, as we see <strong>har 
  kankar me shankar... </strong>god in every granite rock.</p>

  Then she sobs clinging to that painting; (aside: where a wail is the 
  ultimate weapon of a woman;) and then she strays from there 
  thinking, 'if I go away from this place, this beguiler surely 
  follows me, then I can chide him to accept...'</p>

<p class="tat">

  Then she simmers down her simmering mind meditating on you 
  concluding, 'yes, he's with me... he'll be with me... why should I 
  worry...' hence, Krishna, leave her not in the lurch, as she is 
  lovelorn... [a pa 8-6]</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;The words - snaps, sneers, sinks, sobs, and strays etc., are not 
  just a cluster of words jumbled by the poet. Each has its own 
  significance and some of them are compiled here, as said by ancient 
  commentators. For the wail-weapon of woman: <span class="span1">
  bharata muni </span>says; <span class="span1">rudita mudita maatram 
  yoSitaam vigraheSu... </span>'when a women start their siren like 
  wailing, men are supposed to yield...' hence, siren has this meaning 
  too - 4 a - a dangerously fascinating woman; a temptress; b - a 
  tempting pursuit etc., and hence, wailing is the congenital weapon 
  of a woman - <span class="span1">Natura dat unicuique quod sibi 
  conveniens est. </span>Nature gives to each what is appropriate. So 
  that is that.</p>

<p class="comment">

  What a deer can do when triangularly caught between wildfire, tiger 
  and a hunter with a snare? So also, Raadha is unhappy, caught 
  between wildfire like bodily heat, deathlike, tigerish Love-god, and 
  human-netlike misapprehensive friends. The first foot details
  <span class="span1">udvega avastha </span>- ecstatic state - A 
  trance induced by intense religious devotion; does not show reduced 
  bodily functions that are typical of other trances. Other foots 
  detail the <span class="span1">vyaadi avastha </span>- where
  <span class="span1">vyaadhi</span> is not necessarily a bedridden 
  condition, but an uneasy predicament, as yoga says. Its condition is 
  like this: <span class="span1">abhiiSTa sangama abhaavaat vyaadiH 
  santaapa lakshaNaH | atra santaapa nishshsvau shiita vastu niSevaNam 
  | na uttaram bhaaSate prasne na iikshate ca shruNoti ca || </span>
  roughly: because of the lack of desired object, a sort of uneasiness 
  occurs; anguishing, sighing, devouring cool items, non-replying 
  questions of dear ones, or even not looking at them eye to eye... 
  are its states. This poet Jayadeva is an expert in using the name of 
  the metre of his poem, as an item of portrayal in his versification. 
  This verse is said in <span class="span1">shaarduula vikriiDitam</span>, 
  which he incorporated in last foot. This is not for 'just punning' 
  the verse, but to use those objects in that name of metre, as 
  objects of poetic thought.</p>

  &quot;hè, Krishna, Raadha is now in a kind of morbid lovesickness. She 
  frissons, sighs, raves, shivers, droops, swings up, goes into 
  delirium with rolling eyes with half-shut eyelids. Next, she gets 
  up, stumbles and swoons. For this kind of sickness, you alone are 
  the godlike doctor. As such, if you come to give a potion of 
  medicine, called your love-grace, she definitely survives. 
  Otherwise, she has to breath her last...' [4-5]</p>

<p class="comment">

  &nbsp;Unseen Indra hurls his Thunderbolt from a distant place and it 
  pains the target, only when it meets its target. Nevertheless, this 
  fellow is here before her eyes, and he has not hurled any bolt or 
  dart at Raadha, but hurt her with his charm. Hence, he alone should 
  ease it; otherwise, he will be more horrible and ungodly in his 
  demeanour.</p>
