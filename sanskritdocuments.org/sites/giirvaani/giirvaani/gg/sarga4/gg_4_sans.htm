<p class="comment">This famous song contains two tones, one that of a tongue-lashing 
of a friend, with somewhat harsh words of milkmaid, <span class="span1">niSTura 
vaakya, nindaa vaacka </span>which is limitable only to text. Its construal is:
<span class="span1">candanam kaamam adhikam iirayati; tava bhaavanayaa, tava saakshaatkaareNa, 
tayi liinaa...</span> etc. Moreover, the other tone is the entreaty of a devotee, 
with <span class="span1">stuti vaakya, praardhanaa vaakya </span>devotional eulogy, 
extolling, praise song, which is tunefully adopted by singers with most piteous 
requisition to comeback to Raadha. The reprise in this song is only for words

<p class="tat">&quot;hè, Krishna, you know how delicate is Raadha&#39;s heart, and targeting 
it Love-god is incessantly flinging fiery flowery arrows, but uncaring for herself 
she is bravely preparing a lotus-petal shield, like that of a leathern or metallic 
shield used by brave warriors, only to protect you, as she ensconced you in the 
innermost recesses of her heart... and those petals are wide enough to cover you, 
and wet enough, for they are wet with water and with her love as well, to give enough 
resistance to you from their heat... hence, she is lovelorn, and unbefitting is 
your leaving her in the lurch... [a pa 8-2]</p>

<p class="comment">This girl Raadha has a sense of delicacy. Usually devotees arrange 
a small golden or silver throne to gods in their worship rooms, and place an idol 
on it, and run the rote of what they have learnt. Here, she is making a flowery 
bed to give painless seating, and a seat collapsible even as a bed, if he wants 
to repose. Stones replaced the thrones of gods in temples, as we see

<p class="itrsloka">Or</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;hè, Krishna, she knows that you are highly inaccessible to anyone, 
and such as you are, she wants to possess you for herself, only for herself, thus 
she personifies you in that musk painting in her imagination and engrossed in her 
meditation on you through that painting, in doing so she snaps at you saying, &#39;you 
beguiler, now you&#39;re here... what happened all the time... go, go away to those 
doltish girls, for they alone match you...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">And then sneers at that unmoving painting to say, &#39;oh, still you&#39;re 
loitering here without making a move... that&#39;s why I call you a beguiler... but, 
now I beguiled you to win you...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">Then sinks down saying, &#39;ah, poor me, I can&#39;t make you happy with 
my clasps and clings for you&#39;re in a picture... alas...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">Then she sobs clinging to that painting; (aside: where a wail is 
the ultimate weapon of a woman;) and then she strays from there thinking, &#39;if I 
go away from this place, this beguiler surely follows me, then I can chide him to 
accept...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">Then she simmers down her simmering mind meditating on you concluding, 
&#39;yes, he&#39;s with me... he&#39;ll be with me... why should I worry...&#39; hence, 
o, Krishna, 
leave her not in the lurch, as she is lovelorn... [a pa 8-6]</p>

<p class="comment">The words - snaps, sneers, sinks, sobs, and strays etc., are 
not just a cluster of words jumbled by the poet. Each has its own significance and 
some of them are compiled here, as said by ancient commentators. For the wail-weapon 
of woman: <span class="span1">bharata muni </span>says; <span class="span1">rudita 
mudita maatram yoSitaam vigraheSu... </span>&#39;when women start their siren like 
wailing, men are supposed to yield...&#39; hence, in Oxford, siren has this meaning too - 4 a - 
a dangerously fascinating woman; a temptress; b - a tempting pursuit etc., and hence, 
wailing is the congenital weapon of a woman - <span class="span1">Natura dat unicuique 
quod sibi conveniens est. </span>Nature gives to each what is appropriate. So that 
is that.</p>

<p class="comment">What a deer can do when triangularly caught between wildfire, 
tiger and a hunter with a snare? So also, Raadha is unhappy, caught between wildfire 
like bodily heat, deathlike, tigerish Love-god, and human-netlike misapprehensive 
friends. The first foot details <span class="span1">udvega avastha </span>- ecstatic 
state - A trance induced by intense religious devotion; does not show reduced bodily 
functions that are typical of other trances. Other foots detail the
<span class="span1">vyaadi avastha </span>- where <span class="span1">vyaadhi</span> 
is not necessarily a bedridden condition, but an uneasy predicament, as yoga says. 
Its condition is like this: <span class="span1">abhiiSTa sangama abhaavaat vyaadiH 
santaapa lakshaNaH | atra santaapa nishshsvau shiita vastu niSevaNam | na uttaram 
bhaaSate prasne na iikshate ca shruNoti ca || </span>roughly: because of the lack 
of desired object, a sort of uneasiness occurs; anguishing, sighing, devouring cool 
items, non-replying questions of dear ones, or even not looking at them eye to eye... 
are its states. This poet Jayadeva is an expert in using the name of the metre of 
his poem, as an item of portrayal in his versification. This verse is said in
<span class="span1">shaarduula vikriiDitam</span>, which he incorporated in last 
foot. This is not for &#39;just punning&#39; the verse, but to use those objects in that 
name of metre, as objects of poetic thought.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;hè, Krishna, Raadha is now in a kind of morbid lovesickness. She 
frissons, sighs, raves, shivers, droops, swings up, goes into delirium with rolling 
eyes with half-shut eyelids. Next, she gets up, stumbles and swoons. For this kind 
of sickness, you alone are the godlike doctor. As such, if you come to give a potion 
of medicine, called your love-grace, she definitely survives. Otherwise, she has 
to breath her last...&#39; [4-5]</p>

<p class="comment">It will be painful to the casually peripheral readers to read 
the gist, if all the trash of <span class="span1">naayakii bhaava-s, lakshaNa diipikaa-s

words, minus their function, is re-rolled here.</p>

<p class="comment">Unseen Indra hurls his Thunderbolt from a distant place and it 
pains the target, only when it meets its target. Nevertheless, this fellow is here 
before her eyes, and he has not hurled any bolt or dart at Raadha, but hurt her 
with his charm. Hence, he alone should ease it; otherwise, he will be more horrible 
and ungodly in his demeanour.</p>

shine, clusters of lotuses and the like? However, it is surprising that though she 
is enervated and emaciated, she is contemplating on you, on you alone, staying in 
a lonely place, asserting that you alone are the supreme cooling agent than others,
