<span class="span1">raghuvamsham</span> has a place next only to
<span class="span1">vAlmIki rAmAyaNa</span> in Sanskrit literature. It is “<font color="#800000">an 
expression in a delightful form and melodious language of the best thoughts and 
noblest emotions which the spectacle of life awakens in the finest souls</font>...” 
so say Jagannatha Pandit and Vidyaanatha. It has a special merit of “<span class="span1">subordinating 
form to matter, his poems set the sentimental chords into vibrations</span>...” 
so says <span class="span1">Krishnarao Mahadeva Joglekar</span>, who translated 
this poem into English as early as in 1916, a publication of Nirnaya-Sagara Press.</p>

<p class="tat">

What Sir William Jones said about Kalidasa&#39;s works and Sanskrit, in general, while 
translating Sacontala, that position still obtains in the respect of those works. 
He said:&nbsp; - <span class="span2">A modern epigram was lately repeated to me, which does so much 
honour to the author of Sacontalá, that I cannot forbear exhibiting a literal version 
of it: &quot;Poetry was the sportful daughter of Válmic, and, having been educated by 
Vyása, she chose Cálidás for her bridegroom after the manner of Viderbha: she was 
the mother of Amara, Sundar, Sancha, Dhanic; but now, old and decrepit, her beauty 
faded, and her unadorned feet flipping as she walks, in whose cottage does she disdain 
to take shelter?</span></p>

<p class="tat">

<span class="span1">raghuvamsham</span> has many commentaries, but one generally 
accessible and understandable is that of <font color="#800080">mahaamahopaadhyaaya 
mallinaatha suuri</font>. Another work of Vallabhaacaarya is said to be very nice, 
but presently it is unavailable in India, yet available in Netherlands at a cost 
of many Euros.</p>

<p class="tat">

The translation of Gopal Raghunath Nandargikar [1897] is the trend-setting work, 
published in Year: 1897. But, at a time when we took up the present translation, 
this work of nandArgIkar was available out side India, say in 2 Microfilm copies 
in USA. One at Columbia Univ. and another In District of Columbia, Arlington 
Library. Later, Digital Library of India has uploaded the tiff files of this 
work and it is available with their Bangalore server.</p>

<p class="tat">

Another work of 1902 surfaced recently. This is the poetic work of P. De Lacy 
Johnston, M.A., Oxon. ; M.R.A.S. ; OF H.M. Bengal Civil Service (Retd); sometime 
Boden Sanskrit Scholor in the University of Oxford; 1902; title: The Story of 
Raghu&#39;s Line by Kalidasa; Published by Adine House, London, 1902; whereever 
possible the foots from this poem are posted after verses in this work.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">

The next in line is that of <span class="span1">Krishnarao Mahadeva Joglekar </span>[1916], 
Nirnayasagar Edn. This book too is out of 
print and we are hanging around a much dilapitated copy of it. And though the way 
of Joglekar&#39;s translation, words used etc., is obsolete to present day 
readers, 
this book is the mainstay for us, and source book is source book. The 
chapterwise notes and commentary sections of this work of Joglekar are also made 
available in pdf files, along with each sarga of our work, for interested readers.</p>

<p class="tat">

&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">

<span class="span1">cavaet: </span>Wherever possible Joglekar&#39;s words, paragraphs, notes,
<span class="span1">tAtparya</span>-s etc are 
<span class="span1">lift-irrigated</span> out of love for his way of 
epression, though his English, at times, is an overhead-transmission for present day 
readers.</p>

<p class="tat">

&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">

We are attempting <span class="span1">raghuvamsham</span> in the series of word 
for word translations, after Valmiki Ramayana, Ritu samhaaram, Gita Govindam, only 
to tell apart the words used by the poet and their meanings.&nbsp; Since this work 
of ours is not the grand finale to the purport of this poem, please treat this as 
a guidebook to masterwork, since it is a fanciful and humble attempt to say what 
the poet had said. kAlidAsa himself said this poem with a similar fancifulness
<font color="#800080">- caapalaaya</font>... Let us become students first, to become 
pundits at a later time.</p>

<p class="tat">

&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">

It is a nuisance to attempt translating kAlidAsa, nothing ends anywhere, no amount 
of typing gets &#39;his&#39; verbal picture satisfactorily, more so, wading through his 
poetics will be bogging us down continuously. Hence, there are not many translations, 
other than small works like meghadUtam etc, for fear of failure in communication. 
Yet, here is an attempt...</p>
