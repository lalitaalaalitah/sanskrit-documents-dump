<h2 class="style11">shrI - in shrI-sUktam</h2>
<h3><span class="style12">shrI </span>- what is it? What does this prefix mean?</h3>



<p class="tat">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">The syllable <span class="span1">shrI</span>

originates in <span class="span1">shrI-sUktam</span> of Rig-Veda.<img alt="shrI-devi" src="../images/gl.jpg" width="219" height="253" style="float: right"></p>

<p class="tat">This <span class="span1">shrI</span> is not only the material 
prosperity but both <span class=
"span2">aihika-AmuShmika</span> prosperities - as contained in
<span class="span1">shrI sUktam</span> of Rig-Veda. But, over a time this label 
has come to mean goddess lakshmi, the consort of
<span class="span2">nArAyaNa</span>, who in turn is the anthropomorphized 
goddess presiding over every kind of prosperity, as has been adumbrated in 
canons like, <span class="span2">saubhgya lakshmi upaniShad, lakshmi tantra</span> 
etc.</p>

<p class="tat"><span class="span1">shrI</span> as contained in Rig-Veda <span class="span1">
shrI sUktam</span> is primarily meant to mean - a non-deficient, non-exiguous, 
non-sparse - a want-less-syndrome; but not overabundance, hoarding, or amassing 
syndrome; a completeness, plenitude; <span class=
"span1">pashu</span> <span class="span1">sampada</span> - plenitude of cattle; <span class="span1">
dhAnya</span> <span class=
"span1">sampada</span> - of grain and cereals; <span class=
"span1">vidyA sampada</span> - of education; <span class=
"span1">santAna sampada</span> - of progeny; <span class=
"span1">vAk siddhi</span>= of speech; <span class="span1">vAk shuddhi</span> - 
expression; health, vigour, vitality - and what not. Ultimately - <span class="span1">
bhogam, bhAgyam</span> - living a self-sufficient life till its finish, of 
course, through all these want-less-syndromes.</p>

<p class="tat">To arrive at the concept of the syllable
<span class="span1">shrI</span>, it is necessary to scribble the meanings of <span class="span1">
shrI sUktam</span> on the above lines, because its etymological formation and 
derivation - the formation of a word and the development of its meaning - occurs 
in 3rd hymn of that <span class="span1">sUktam</span>.</p>
<p class="tat">To jot down the meaning of this <span class=
"span1">sUktam,</span> another deterrent is the word <span class=
"span1">jAta-veda</span>, who in this <span class=
"span1">sUktam</span> is continuously propitiated to fetchthat plenitude. <span class="span1">
jAta-veda</span>, the Ritual-Fire, is a lesser god in hierarchy of gods, when 
compared to the consort of all-powerful <span class="span2">nArAyaNa</span>, and 
how can he fetch a superior god/goddess to the fire-oblator - will be the 
ensuing question. Then, will it be worthwhile to go on pouring costly cow-ghee 
into fire, wishing unknown prosperity or plenitude, or goddess lakshmi herself - 
will be another question.</p>

<p class="tat">It is not so; Fire-god is the endower of
<span class="span1">shrI</span> - plenitude, whereby the usher of goddess 
lakshmi - <span class="span1">shriyam icChet hutAshanAt</span> - acquire 
prosperity through Fire-god:</p>
<p class="itrsloka"><span class="span1">Arogyam bhAkrAdicChet 
shriyamicCheddhutAshanAt<br>
j~nAnam maheshvarAdicChet mokshamicChejjanArdanAt ||</span></p>
<p class="tat">This one syllable - <span class="span1">eka akshara shabdam - 
shrI</span>, nominating Fire-god, has become the
<span class="span1">bIjAksharam</span> in <span class="span1">shrI sUktam</span>. 
Hence <span class="span1">shrI bIjam</span> is

<span class="span1">sarva Ashraya</span>, whereby <span class=
"span1">jAta-veda</span> is inseparable from <span class=
"span1">shrI</span> - plenitude, and if the ritual fire is regularly glowing, 
there the prosperity will be regular. Hence the fire-oblator used to worship 
ritual fire wishing to get
<span class="span1">vAk, j~nAna, aishvrya, shakti</span> - speech, knowledge, 
prosperity, vitality etc - through which he used to live long. As such, that 
Fire-god is addressed for that plenitude that which is indistinguishable from 
Fire-god in feminine / neuter terms throughout this <span class="span1">sUkta</span>, 
which need not be confounded with goddess lakshmi proper.</p>
<p class="tat">And this <span class="span1">shrI</span> is affectionately called <span class="span1">
shrI-devi</span> who is a little different from mahalakshmi; and the prefix <span class=
"span1">shrI</span> / <span class="span1">shrImti</span> denotes certain aura of 
wellbeing around the addressed celebrity, later came to mean India Mr / Mrs. 
Please see hymn 3 for its details.</p>

unction [from Latin unctio, from ung(u)ere unct- anoint]</span> which has the

<p class="prati">2 a] soothing words or thought. 4 a] a fervent or sympathetic
