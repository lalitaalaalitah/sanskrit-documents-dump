     Poet Jayadeva wishing to portray the divine love of Rādha and Krishna in his immortal song <span class="span1">giita govindam</span> starts this with a benedictory verse that indicates the theme of his poetic work,

  <p class="comment">
     This is the &#39;worm&#39;s eye view&#39; of this poetic work, but not the invocation of deity of speech / poetics. The invocation is in next verse.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     A parable is said about this verse. As usual with any other poet, Jayadeva was also said to be a twiddler of his thumbs, and seeing this maternal uncle daunts him for not taking up any job or profession like any other 
     youngster. Jayadeva refuses trivial jobs and declares himself as a poet of par excellence, and he can portray <span class="span1">ayam</span> &#39;that&#39; god in an innovative manner and in off the beaten track. Then his 
     maternal uncle questions who ‘that’ god is, and the theme of &#39;that&#39; poetry, about &#39;that&#39; god. Then this poem emerged from the depths of heart of Jayadeva about <span class="span1">ayam</span>, ‘that god’ and his sequestered 
     deeds. At the last words of this verse, that uncle sprang up to his feet in ire, and almost said to have stifled Jayadeva to death, for uttering such &#39;blasphemous poetry&#39; on &#39;that&#39; god.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     Then Jayadeva, to stand by his own self declaration as an eminent poet, started to compose the rest of this work, and put the next verse, an invocatory poem, to stylus. Thus, though unconnected, this poem remained at 
     the head of the work as a prologue, preamble etc., in the pattern of <span class="span1">aashiirvaada, vastu nirdehsa, mangala aadiini</span> &#39;a sort of blessings, indicative of the topic of poetry, and for auspicious 
     beginning of the poetic works’ etc which the poets usually employ. Here the love game of Rādha and Mādhava itself became the auspicious, blessing a priori, and content of this poetic work. That way, without naming him 
     as Krishna, Govinda, or Mādhava etc., the poet puts the pronoun on the tongue of Nanda, the father of Krishna, as <span class="span1">ayam, ayam bhiiruH...</span> on the lines of <span class="span1">kaalidasa</span>, 
     who did the same in his <span class="span1">kumaara sambhavam 5 ayam janaaH prahR^iShTa manaaH tapo dhane</span> However, the poet really starts his work with the next verse.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     <span class="span1">raadhe</span> said by Nanda has three shades; <span class="span1">anunaya vaakya</span> &#39;Rādha, please take him home, for he is still a boy...’ <span class="span1">kopa ukti</span> ‘said in anger...&#39; 
     &#39;Rādha, don&#39;t you know that he is boyish and naively timorous... when it is dusking and darkening... what is it you play in nights... you go home, and while going take this fellow also to his home... no night wanderings... 
     &#39;; <span class="span1">tattva ukti</span> &#39;with some subtext... &#39;Rādha, <span class="span1">tvam eva</span> you alone are his, <span class="span1">gR^iham</span> &#39;house, personified by wife you on becoming wife...&#39;
     <span class="span1">praapaya</span> &#39;make him prosperous...&#39; &#39;On your account Krishna became a householder; hence you alone lead him forth and enrich his prosperity as his wife...&#39;</p>

  <p class="comment">
     Rādha did not get her cherished desire fulfilled in a trice, or at a snap of finger. She had to undergo her historical ordeal, put to test by Krishna. Why should she? When she is willing, when Krishna is at her side, 
     when father Nanda permitted, when her maid encourages her... is she still put to test? These would be the pertinent doubts that arise, though they are not the questions in reality. Yes! She is put to litmus test by 
     this most mischievous Krishna, and she had to shed her tears, sob her sobs, frown her resentments etc. Where all this has happened? On each and every pathway to home, at each and every tree, and in each of the bowers. 
     Krishna seems to be there, but actually he is not there; though he is supposedly unavailable, but his fluting is audible very nearly. So, to depict that a true devotee has to undergo a step by step process for the culmination 
     of his/her ardent desire, the poet indicates that there are many a pathway to tread, many are the trees of wisdom, and many are the bowers to contemplate lonely and solitarily, not only for Rādha but to any devotee. 
     All these are godsend gifts of nature and humans.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     The clouds spreading on sky will naturally be many. Here the word <span class="span1">meghaiH</span> is also in plural, but the commentators limit them to number nine, without the sense of innumerability, and simile 
     them with the nine states, out of the ten states of love pangs or <span class="span1">manmatha avastha s:</span></p>

  <p class="itrsloka">

     <span class="span1">1] eyeing; 2] heart loosing; 3] endeavour; 4] sleeplessness; 5] shrivelling; 6] disinterestedness in anything; 7] shamelessness; 8] maddening; 9] swooning; 10] trying to end oneself.</span> The 
     word <span class="span1">ambaram</span> sky suggests &#39;openness, sky is the limit for enjoyment; elate yourselves to sky...&#39; And the word <span class="span1">vana bhuva</span> &#39;woodland areas are like heavens, lonely, 
     secluded... thus a secreted heaven is said to be there on earth, on the banks of River Yamuna...&#39; because Krishna is present there. And <span class="span1">naktam</span> &#39;night time&#39; is the proper time for such activity, 
     since it is forbidden from dawn to dusk. And <span class="span1">yamunaa kuule</span> &#39;on the banks of Yamuna, exciting environ of Yamuna, with breezes wafting coolness of Yamuna waters and fragrances of flowers on 
     to its banks. The openness, solitude, rivers, waters, flowers, fragrances, all of them made that place heavenly. Above all, <span class="span1">ayam</span>, &#39;that&#39; god is here. Then what more does a devotee require 
     for his/her dedication, in order to commingle in him physically, in mortal&#39;s parlance, and psychically in a devotee&#39;s experience.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     On the use of ultramundane word <span class="span1">maa dhava</span> lakSmii&#39;s, husband Vishnu may be observed, even when Krishna is manifestly a mortal, and available just before the eye. Though Krishna is Vishnu and 
     though Rukmini, his first consort, is lakSmii, Krishna&#39;s longing for an ephemeral and poetic embodiment called Rādha is more, and it suggests that god is inclined more towards real devotees, rather than for his coequals, 
     like Rukmini or lakSmii and the like.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     Aesthetics info for Sanskrit students: The whole work revolves round the following aesthetics. 1] <span class="span1">uddipanaa bhaavaaH</span> excitants of mood: clouds, woodlands, night, arbours and bowers, riverside, 
     cool breezes etc; 2] <span class="span1">aalambana bhaavaaH</span> mood for devotement: Rādha, Yamuna banks, arbours and bowers, solitude etc.; 3] <span class="span1">anu bhaava</span> indicatives of mood timorousness, 
     prudishness, coyness of all characters; 4] <span class="span1">vybhicaara bhaavaaH</span> deviating moods ecstasy, fear, interestedness, embarrassment etc; 5] <span class="span1">sthaayii bhaavaaH</span> common mood 
     longing, desperation, jealousy, resentment etc., with these moods, it is <span class="span1">sambhoga vipralambha sR^ingaara</span> and the metre of this verse is <span class="span1">shaarduula vikriiDitam.</span></p>

  <p class="comment">
     Though the moods are available in each foot of whole poem, they may not be brought in here, as they do not mean anything these days. But in a prima donna ish fashion, some are said here. From <span class="span1">meghaiH</span> 
     to <span class="span1">praapaya</span> it is <span class="span1">vipralmbha sR^ingaara</span>; <span class="span1">iththam</span> to <span class="span1">kelayaH</span> it is <span class="span1">sambhoga sR^ingaara</span>;
     <span class="span1">shyaamaa tamaala, radhaamaadhavoH</span> are in <span class="span1">anu praasaa aalnnkaara</span>; first part of verse has <span class="span1">samuccaya alankaara</span> while the later part is having
     <span class="span1">ashiir alankaara</span> and on total it is said in <span class="span1">samshR^iSTi alankaara.</span> And the first verse itself is indicative of the activities of Krishna, and his playful acts, disporting, 
     or the frolicking that is termed as <span class="span1">raasa liila, raasa kriiDa, krishna liila,</span> which will be heart pleasing.</p>

     This invocation starts with <span class="span1">vaak devataa</span> after Kalidasa&#39;s <span class="span1">vaak arthaav iva sampR^iktau</span> in epic <span class="span1">kumaarassambhavam</span>. In those days, poetic 
     narration about one&#39;s own wife or about her performing arts was a taboo. Jayadeva pooh poohed this with the above stanza, questioning as to how Satyabhama danced before Krishna, and how Paarvati always dances with always 
     dancing Shiva. Further, devotion does not equate with solitary self surrender, or by hermetic sainthood, or by murmuring hymns singly. That is for devotees of <span class="span1">nirguNa brahma</span> and this &#39;
     <span class="span1">bhaagavata</span> devotion&#39; culminates only when <span class="span1">upacaaraa s</span> &#39;devotional offerings&#39; are offered, and the singing and dancing are the end part of any worship. Even today 
     this custom continues, but only as a lip service, <span class="span1">Chatram dhaarayaami, caamaram viijayaami, giita vaadya nR^ityam pradashayaami</span> &#39;I hold up an parasol, I fan you, I show dance, sing, play music 
     instruments... oh, god give me what I want...&#39; Instead of worshipping with a dialogue, Jayadeva and Padmaavati danced. It is said the Jayadeva recognised not only a dancer in his wife, but a <span class="span1">bhaagavatii 
     pratipatti</span> &#39;female devotee&#39; in her, and thus both have adored their god jointly.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     The analogy between Vaasudeva and Jayadeva is <span class="span1">vasubhiH diipyata iti vaasudeva</span> &#39;one shines forth with his wealth...&#39; If Krishna is resplendent with his charm, Jayadeva is glistening with his 
     wordplay. <span class="span1">tasya apatyam vaasudeva</span> &#39;his son is Vaasudeva...&#39; meaning that one who has come out of his indebtedness towards his father, hence a free bird to take his own wings and to flirt as 
     he may. Jayadeva is equally free to flirt away from the orthodoxy of poetics.</p>

&nbsp;This verse will be at 4th place in North Indian versions and in South, it is as above. The word used <span class="span1">mathura</span> melodious mellowly, meaning that the words used have <span class="span1">shabda 
     gata, artha gata, maadhuryam</span> sound based and meaning based melody. In them sound based melody occurs when harsh sounding consonants like <span class="span1">Tha Dha</span> are not used, while the meaning based 
     melody occurs when those words are primarily heart pleasing, yet a little thinking is necessary to derive their meanings, unlike the words of absolute philosophy, which do not give any satisfaction eve after delving 
     deep into them. Again the <span class="span1">komala</span> has the two aspects of meaning. In them, sound based delicacy occurs when too much of combining vowels and consonants is not adopted as in
     <span class="span1">nistriaguNya, tymbaka</span> and the like, which usage is called as <span class="span1">cakra bandha padma bandha</span> way of compounding. And the word <span class="span1">kaanta</span> is also 
     the same, in that the poetic work is desirable for it has sound based lissomness, and meaning based litheness. The usefulness of this verse is <span class="span1">hari smaraNa, vilaasa vidya sikShaNa</span> meditation 
     on Krishna, and how the coaxing and combing of womenfolk will be delightfully inciting. Thus, this work&#39;s subject matter contains cognizable god in Krishna, if it is mulled over by his cognitive devotees
     <span class="span1">smaarya smaaraka bhaava; diipaka alankaara; paancaalii riiti; kaishikii vR^itti; vR^ittam dR^ita vilambita</span> With this invocatory poem the poet is embarking on the usual prologues necessary 
     for a poetic work.</p>

&nbsp;The second meaning is not a ridicule thrown at other poets, but it is like &#39;throwing hat in the ring...&#39; and avowed declaration that he alone is good at poetry. It was a practice to say one or two verses in praise

  <p class="comment">
&nbsp;Krishna, earth, and wild boar are black; while boar&#39;s fang and crescentic moon like fang are white. While the earth is spinning on the tip of fang, its blackness is appearing as the deer mark in the moon. The earth 
     is, in a way, a blemish to god for he created it, but it separated itself from him, and its inmates always do certain deeds that bring more blemishes to him.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     The gods do not come into physical contact with earth and earthlings. If gods have an errand on earth they have to transmogrify their forms to dwell on earth. If any earthling goes into the realm of gods, it is a blemish 
     on the gods who entertained them. Here, blemish or otherwise Hari is bearing earth on his fang.</p>

     The <span class="span1">petalum</span> in Late Latin means ‘metal plate’. It is usual for a honeybee to sting and lacerate delicate lotuses for nectar. But lotus lacerating thick skinned honeybee is unusual. Though 
     the palms of god are like delicate petals of lotus, they have very sharp and slashing tips of fingernails, like the claws of lion, only to bisect thick skinned vice, called monstrosity. Hence those tips of fingernails

  <p class="comment">
     When Vishnu took incarnation of dwarf boy he seeks donation of a three foot space from Emperor Bali, and Bali being a no naysayer, accords it. Then the dwarf covers entire earth with one foot, entire heaven with the 
     second, and asks Bali where to keep the third. Bali shows his head and the boy places his third foot on the head of Bali, subduing Bali to netherworlds. In doing so, when that dwarf boy raises his foot to cover heavens, 
     his toe goes straight to the presence of Brahma. Observing that toe as his father Vishnu&#39;s toe, Brahma anoints it with sacred waters. When that dwarf boy withdraws his foot from heaven to place it on Bali&#39;s head, then 
     the sacred water poured on that toenail by Brahma, rushed onto earth as River <span class="span1">Ganga</span>. Here the poet is saying that Bali is being deluded each time in each cycle of eras, as a present continuous 
     action.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     At the very start of extolling his hero of his poetic work, the poet has gone straight to the bosomy busts of hero’s consort, and to hear this, it primarily appears to be an erotic word, and if the hearer happens to 
     be an Oedipus, he will be excited even by his mother’s mammaries. But here Goddess lakSmii is the Supreme Mother and she has Divine mammae, and let millions and millions take birth, she can feed them, indefatigably. 
     Similar is the word used for <span class="span1">lalita</span> in <span class="span1">lalita sahasra naamaavali kaThina sthana maNDalaa</span>… as one among many of her motherly attributes.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     Here lakSmii, the personified fortune, is abiding in the lotus like heart of Vishnu, say Krishna, thus undifferentiated are the chests, either as that of a male or as the bust of a female. She is said to be
     <span class="span1">shrita</span> whorled around him like a climbing plant onto a tree. So, the poet attempts to distinguish which is which, and says that he is wearing a garland of basil leaves and flowers, which he 
     alone wears, hence recognise him as Krishna. Because he is so tightly embraced by the personified fortune, he never becomes a pauper and he ever endows shelter under that absolute fortune to his devotees, called
     <span class="span1">aashraya Niiyatvam.</span> So, anyone can seek for his shelter, as such he is called <span class="span1">shrayaH patiH</span> Omni shelterer, of course, under the aegis of Goddess 
     lakSmii. Without 
     her he is nothing. And <span class="span1">vanamaala</span> indicates hale and healthiness, thus ready to spring to his feet in the period of crisis, i.e., Omnipotent. Ear knobs indicate learnedness, for they were accorded 
     according to one’s own scholarliness, called <span class="span1">makara kuNDala, candra kuNDala,</span> like the present day graduate / post graduate gowns and headgears. Hence, this is indicative of his Omniscience.</p>

  <p class="comment">

&nbsp; There is another shade for ‘an ornament to Seetha&#39;. Rama decorates and paints foliate designs on the body of Seetha, with an erasable tattooing. Thus, it means that no less than Rama made decorations on Seetha. Secondly, 
     when Seetha was ill at ease to wear sari of an anchoress, when given by Kaikeyi while going to forests, Rama demonstrates the folding, tying, and wearing of that dress. Thus by these two, the hero is qualified not only 
     as a romantic hero, but a knower of all arts <span class="span1">sarva kalaa vishaarada.</span> As a brave and bold enemy subjugator, Rama is depicted as releaser from mortality, by releasing demon Dushana from mortality

  <p class="comment">
     That vermilion mark on his chest appears as a seal lakSmii has put, because there is no too generous accord of fortune. It is sealed in certain cases. If this god is going on according, where is an end for it?</p>

  <p class="comment">
     Why his heart should bless us when he has four hands, of which one is said to be a blessing hand? There will be three items of annihilation, namely disc, mace, and conch in his three hands and the fourth one is said 
     to be <span class="span1">abhaya hasta, a</span> blessing hand. Is it withdrawn now or what? Not so, that blessing hand is symbolic one when he alone functions. Here his chest is now under the auspices of 
     lakSmii, and 
     thus both of them are blessing a heartily double blessing.</p>

  <p class="comment">
     As a consort she knows that his heart feels fondness for anyone, but she is unbothered if that fondness is for some devotee. It will be bothersome if this god brings in another ladylove, apart from the host that is 
     already available. So, a seal is sealed, <span class="span1">mudritam</span> on his heart with her vermilion mark, <span class="span1">kumkuma, tilaka,</span> as a signal to prospective ladyloves, of course, in vain<span class="span1">.</span> 
     By her doubting, we must infer that he has &#39;such a fondness&#39; for not only for Rukmini and Satyabhama and the like, but even more for Rādha.</p>

     This springtime is more bothersome than the bother of separation from their ladyloves, and hence time has predominance on earthlings, may it be humans or others. But humans can quench their desires in dreams, and when 
     they can dream about embracing their ladyloves, they can even dream about the all embracing Krishna. Here Rādha is not advised to be dreamy, but to quickly reach her goal, namely Krishna. Spring is the only season for 
     pastoral poetry and hence it is extolled thus far. <span class="span1">alankaara kaavya linga; riiti gauDi; shringaara vipralambha; metre shaarduula vikrriDitam.</span></p>

     Many take the word <span class="span1">niila kalevara</span> as an absolute black colour of body, while it is sky blue black, on par with ‘sky blue pink’ n. &amp; adj. n. an imaginary colour, or somewhat semi sapphirine

&nbsp;The damsel is hugging even before the hero tries to embrace her; hence, she is in eagerness as her <span class="span1">naayika lakShaNa</span> is <span class="span1">mugdha</span>, a meekish heroine. Some scholars 
     translate this word <span class="span1">mugdha</span> as a foolish girl. This translates as innocent, ignorant, artless rhetorical <span class="span1">naayika</span>, artless insofar as romantic advances are concerned. 
     If this black boy and white girl combination is set aside for a while, it is the twosome of devotee god, trying to achieve oneness, in which the devotee has to make his/her first move to embrace the god, as in
     <span class="span1">markaTa nyaaya</span> mother monkey and child monkey syndrome, that contrasts with <span class="span1">maarjaala nyaaya</span> cat kitten syndrome. Swelling bosoms suggests swelling milky devotion,

     This song, which endows gloriousness to the devotees of Krishna, if sung or danced to its tunes, and which contains the arcaneness about the exquisite plays of passion of Krishna in equally arcanus Brindavana, is articulated 
     by Jayadeva, thus let it radiate prosperities to one and all… [a pa 4-8]</p>

  <p class="comment">
&nbsp;With this the poet concludes this lyric. Here Krishna himself is an <span class="span1">adbhutam</span>, because he is manifest separately to each of the milkmaid in a trice, though remaining himself as one entity. 
     In this lyric the words <span class="span1">keli rahasyam</span> are usually translated as secrets sports, or secret love games etc., taking them to be <span class="span1">rahasya keli kalaapam ,</span> but the word
     <span class="span1">rahasyam</span> qualifies the word <span class="span1">keli</span>. Then they are the secrets about those plays, of which the poet wishes to tell, but not how secretly the plays are played, and Krishna 
     is no covert player, either in these dance dramas of Bhaagavata or in the politics of Maha Bhaarata. <span class="span1">chandas laya</span>.</p>

     The word <span class="span1">kuhu, kuhuuH</span> also means no moon night, without a streak of moon. The cooing of Kokila s is a bother to estranged couple, yet they are singing in fifth octave <span class="span1">pancama

     can be tolerated. The sounds of black koels are almost like no moon day that intimidates the moon. But the singing of koels is more painful, and all this culminates into spring fever, a restless or lethargic feeling 
     sometimes associated with spring.</p>
