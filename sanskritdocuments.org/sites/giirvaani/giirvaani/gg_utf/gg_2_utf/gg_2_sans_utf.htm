<p class="tat">Steeply slithered is Rādha&#39;s privilege, for Krishna&#39;s love is equipoise 
in respect of all other milkmaids and herself, thus some grudge overtook her when 
he is pleasure-tripping with others, hence she has gone elsewhere, somewhere into 
a bower of tendrils noisy with the humming of swarms of honeybees spiralling at 
its spire, and when she steeped into that bower she forlornly said this to her girlfriend, 
in solitude. <span class="span1">[2-1]</span></p>

<p class="comment">She became a forlorn one as the humming noise of bees is increasing 
her passion for Krishna, <span class="span1">bhramaraiH kaamoddiipita;</span> hence, 
unable to endure it she has become somewhat a forlorn one, who otherwise is a resolute 
girl.</p>

<p class="comment">Again the word <span class="span1">rahaH sakhiim uvaaca</span> 
is sometimes said as &#39; she told her secrets...&#39; etc. But whole world knows what 
her secret is, i.e., to have Krishna for herself... Hence, it is - said in solitude 
- what she is going to say is not to be heard by others... even if someone is going 
to eavesdrop she/he shall presume it as the humming of bees, as she is going to 
tell next <span class="span1">aSTa padi</span> in a tune and wording almost like 
the buzz of bees.</p>

<p class="comment">Then, <span class="span1">diinaa api</span> forlorn one, even 
so; even so she became a forlorn one by losing her pride, she got guts in regaining 
it - cf., Rāmayana, 4-6-23, <span class="span1">tataH saH raaghavaH diinaH sugriivam 
idam abraviit</span>... even if Rama became a forlorn one, he spoke to
<span class="span1">sugriiva</span> self-confidently.</p>

<p class="comment">In this verse it is <span class="span1">vipralambha sringaara</span>,

<p class="comment">Please read the word <span class="span1">mukha</span> as face, 
but not as mouth, since mouth&#39;s function is different from that of lips, insofar 
as kissing is concerned. Whenever Rādha sees a <span class="span1">Bandhuuka</span> 
flower, a rosy red flower, Krishna&#39;s delicate lower lip is coming to her mind, but 
unavailable is his face, as other round-bottomed girls are invading it. Then why 
not Rādha follow the suite of other girls? How can she do so, when others are mobbing 
him? Moreover she wants him, only for herself, without any sharing or partaking. 
Then the friend may question her, asking &#39;why you are after that boy when he is 
after those many?&#39; For that Rādha&#39;s answer is: &#39;He is fully interested in me... 
none else... <span class="span1">la.mbhita lobham</span>... but he acquired an interestedness, 
created by those girls, when all those girls forcibly dragged him away, so allowed

<p class="comment">The word <span class="span1">tamisram</span> is not the darkness

<span class="span1">tamasomaa jyotir gamayaH</span>. A single ray of light from 
his jewellery is enough to dispel any kind of darkness, then what more can be said 
of his total jewellery and about himself. Thus the ignorance of all the other milkmaids 
is dispelled, call them as sages and saints of Ramayana times, as you may, as a 
kind of deliverance.</p>

<p class="comment">On Rādha&#39;s side, she is remembering their starting time episodes. 
When they started homeward the night was falling, and the pathway was darksome. 
Krishna played her along till she came very near to him. But when she neared him 
all the darkness around them is dispelled only because of the luminosity of his 
jewellery, and she was prudish to be with him in broad daylight like resplendence. 
She ran away into darkness. But he is already there with his luminosity and it was 
inescapable for her to avoid him, in many an attempt. In the meanwhile other milkmaids 
came and carried him away, and she is disgruntled, and now she is grunting about 
it.</p>

<p class="comment">The moon moving in clouds is reminding her about the round sandal-paste 
mark on Krishna&#39;s forehead. The moon may not be moving in clouds as in
<span class="span1">shaakhaa-candra nyaaya</span>, but Krishna&#39;s head is definitely 
and constantly nodding while piping his flute. Then his face is like a mass of clouds, 
and sandal mark on forehead is brilliant than the semi-visible moon in clouds. Though 
he is boy his chest is so hardened to keep his all-loving heart in a strong-doored 
strongroom. From his childhood his chest is rubbed against busty bosomy breasts, 
either of women of <span class="span1">vraj,</span> or of demoness
<span class="span1">puutana</span> from <span class="span1">madhura</span>. Hence 
this boy is calculatingly entertaining unassuming milkmaids, but heedless of Rādha, 
as her claim is for ownership of the very same boy, and hence Rādha is with this 
discontentment, yet not able to forget him.</p>

<p class="comment">Here his followers are said in singular, but we usually take 
it as plural for generalisation. In singularity they are: among gods it is Sage
<span class="span1">naarada</span>; among demons it is Emperor Bali; among humans 
it is <span class="span1">Bhiishma pitaamah</span>, where all the three symbolise 
&#39;surrendering, forfeiture, dedication...&#39; <span class="span1">naarada</span> is 
an out-and-out dedicatee of Vishnu and his incarnations, Emperor Bali is a non-naysayer, 
and <span class="span1">Bhiishma</span> is renowned for his forfeiture of a vast 
kingdom for the sake of one solemn promise. Of course, Rādha as an illiterate &#39;thumb-impression&#39; 
girl may not know all these things, but the poet knows, and hence he puts these 
expressions on her tongue, since she too is no less a devotee. She as a poor girl 
from a hamlet may not have kingdoms to forgo like <span class="span1">Bhiishma</span>, 
forgo spheres of worlds like Bali, and utmost scriptural knowledge like
<span class="span1">Narada,</span> But she is female and female&#39;s body and soul<span class="span1">alone</span> 
are her property or possessions, which she wants to surrender unto Supreme Being.</p>

<p class="comment">The expression <span class="span1">surata vitaanam</span> - is 
many kinds of unions, namely <span class="span1">indraaNi bandha</span> etc., explained 
by <span class="span1">vaastyaana kaama suutra</span>-s, possible only for yogis 
or experts in <span class="span1">sringaara shaastra</span>. The girdle-chain-set 
is not an exaggerated expression, where that girdle ornament contains festoons of 
golden strings, ranging from a set of three to hundreds. Please see Seetha&#39;s Marriage,
<span class="span1">siitaa kalyaan</span> in Ramayana, where each type is detailed. 
And making this sort of girdle-chain to fall without unfastening is called
<span class="span1">prenkhollikita vipariita rati</span> - where
<span class="span1">vipariita rati</span> - is not a crude type, but again a climatic 
and masterly act.</p>

<p class="comment"><span class="span1">Caveat:</span> All this stuff, like masterly 
acts, climatic union etc., will be good for reading and listening. Better limit 
them up to that stage. Trying to implement these things, on purchasing cheap books 
sold on railway platforms, or deducing from such half-baked translations like these, 
would be harmful, and we are told that a threat of death looms on one&#39;s head, if 
these yogic practices are practiced, without proper knowledge. Just construe that 
Krishna is a supramundane <span class="span1">bhogi</span> and yogi, and salute 
him. One cannot be a yogi unless he is a <span class="span1">bhogi</span>. That&#39;s 
all.</p>

<p class="comment">Some sentences are ellipted in the above song for summing up 
for the subtext. This song will not heard, in general, as it is loaded with some 
&#39;nakedness&#39; in expression, and peripherally it sounds &#39;bad&#39; and no singer can go 
on singing for the sake the praise of <span class="span1">alankaara</span> or
<span class="span1">sringaara shaastra</span> contained in it. Hence it is ill fated 
to be sung. If at all it is sung, it is singable in <span class="span1">guNa kriya 
raaga, eka taala</span>, again both are unknown tunes and rhythms in these days, 
and none sings them in the tunes suggested by the poet-singer-dancer Jayadeva these 
days.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh, god-loving people, he whose smiles imply something is seeing 
milkmaids who are with thrilling and throbbing, by which their hair buns are loosened 
and braids slipping repeatedly; they are raising up their arms as though to tie 
up their plaits, in doing so they are artfully showing are their armpits and bosoms 
repeatedly, in doing so, their see-sawing curvaceous eyebrows also confirm their 
desire for him, and he on seeing these wilful acts of simple-minded beauties of 
Brindavan, he got rid of his longings, for he satisfied them to their content, and 
stayed there thinking for along time, such as he is, he that ever-new Krishna shall 
deprive us of all of our despairs... <span class="span1">[2-5]</span></p>

he is becoming, new, newer etc., only by these simple-minded acts of milkmaids.
