INTRODUCTION.
This is a short and sweet stotram consisting of nine verses arranged
in the Pancha chamara meter.
They constitute a prayer to Hanuman to help one to destroy the six
internal enemies that form an obstruction on the road to spirutual progress.
They seek his help to place one's mind at the feet of Lord Rama. Thus
chanting of these verses will help to calm the mind which is a
prerequisite for efficacious prayer or meditation.
Indian mythology offers some unique characters the like of whom are
not available in mythologies of other countries. To name some, they
are Sage Vyasa, Naradha and Hanuman. We will briefly talk about
Hanuman here.

REFERENCES TO HANUMAN IN PURANAS/EPICS.
Hanuman is loved and venerated by all.
He is known for his erudition, bravery, valour and above all
his great self effacing humility. His life story appears in chapters
35 and 36 of the Uttara Kanda of Shrimad Valmiki Ramayana.  Sage
Agastya narrated it  to Shri Rama.
Hanuman is also referred to in Siva Purana, Brahma Purana, Bhagavata
Purana, Bhavishya Purana and Mahabharata. According to Bhagavata
Purana, Hanuman stayed behind after Rama left Ayodhya and remained in
Kimpurusha Varsha where he is still living listening to Ramayana
being sung by the denizens of the place and himself joining them in
the singing. 
किंपुरुषे वर्षे भगवन्तमादिपुरुषं
लक्ष्मणाग्रजं सीताभिरामं रामं तच्चरणसंनिकर्षाभिरतः
परमभागवतो- हनुमान् सह किंपुरुषैः
अविरतभक्तिरुपासते । आर्ष्टिषेणेन सह गन्दर्वैरनुगीयमानं
परमकल्याणीं भर्तृभगवत्कथां समुपश‍ृणोति  स्वयं चेदं गायति ॥(5-19-1,2)\
Full account of Hanuman is given in Parasara Samhita also. The
samhitas are that portion of the vedas that contain the prayers,
mantras set to appropriate chandas (meter) and rituals to propitiate
the God. They are given out by sages who got them as revelations by
divine grace. The author of this samhita is not the Parasara who was
sage Vyasa's father, but his the third generation disciple
(Vyasa->Paila->Baskala->Parasara) who learnt Rig veda. The samhita
contains in detail the story of Hanuman - the god. According to it,
Anjaneya is the ninth incarnation of Hanuman. It contains a
sahasranama. Interestingly, one of the 108 names of Hanuman is
ॐ भविष्यछ्चतुराननाय नमः ।. That is, he will succeed present
Brahma as Lord of creation in the next yuga. According to the samhita
this boon was granted to Hanuman by Brahma Himself  when he visited
Brahmaloka. There is no hint of this in Valmiki Ramayana.
Hanuman was born with an aspect of Lord Siva. This is stated
specifically in Ananda Ramayana. Vrishakapi is the name of one of the
eleven Rudras according to the Vishnu Purana. This name appears in
one of the Sivasahasranamams.  Brahma Purana  refers to Hanuman by
this name. The third Yajus in the seventh Anuvaka of Shri Rudram
reads:नमो दूताय च प्रहिताय च । dUta
is a messenger who is an expert in conveying information and
also gathering information. Prahitha is one deputed by his master on
a specific occassion for a specific duty. The commentators state that
god Agni is meant here as he is said to be the messenger of the
gods.He is also the prahitha or special agent of the yajaman or
performer of a sacrifice to carry the oblations to the god specified.
Thus the Lord Himself acts as a messenger to His devotees and
protects them in that capacity. We may say that it was the Lord as
Krishna who acted as a messenger to the Pandavas. Similarly, we may
say that it was the Lord who as Hanuman acted as a messenger and
conveyed Rama's message to Ravana and also gathered information about
Lanka that will be useful to Rama in case He had to engage in a fight
with Ravana. Lord Siva incarnated as Hanuman to demonstrate to the
world the value of bhakti and the characteristics of a true devotee.
He is also known as Vayuputra, the son of Vayu deva or the wind
god.The great philosopher Madhvacharya explained that Vayu, in this
context refers, not to the Vayu deva but to Mukhyaprana - the first
of Lord Vishnu's creation - who is also known as Hiranyagarbha. He
represents not the individual (व्यष्टि) prana but the total
(समष्टि ) prana or the aggregate of all the individual
pranas.Thus the devas depend on Him for their survival. So He is more
powerful than all the devas and omniscient too (सर्वज्ञः). That
is why he was able to perform deeds that could not be performed by
anyone else. Jambavan when he was encouraging Hanuman to cross the
ocean said that Hanuman was a great scholar and had no equal in
strength, wisdom and courage. Rama himself admited that what Hanuman
had done was impossible even to be imagined by others.(Yuddha
Kanda.1.2)
कृतं हनुमता कार्यं सुमहद् भुवि दुर्लभम् ।
मनसाऽपि यदन्येन न शक्यं धरणीतले ॥
Madhvacharya has quoted extensively from Rig Veda, Skanda Purana and
Vayu Purana to prove that Mukyaprana took three incarnations. They
are Hanuman, Bhimasena and Madhvacharya himself. Hanuman is described
in the Rigveda
as हनु शब्दो ज्ञानवाचि हनुमान् मतिशब्दितः । (i.e) the word
Hanuman means one who has perfect knowledge. He is
also known as intelligent.
Hanuman learnt all the scriptures from the Sun god himself. The Sun
god is always on the move and because of this Hanuman had to learn
while on the move. He had to keep flying in front of his guru, the
Sun god and also facing him, since he cannot be showing his back to
his guru while listening to the guru! He learnt all the vedas and the
six vedangas in a very short time. Hanuman wanted to offer his
teacher the gurudakShina which is to be given at the end of learning.
Initially the Sun god did not want any thing as dakShina. But when
Hanuman insisted, the Sun said that his son Sugriva was living on
earth with his brother Vali and was not having good relationship with
him. Vali was much more powerful than Sugriva. In view of this the
Sun god wanted Hanuman to be with his son Sugriva and be of help to
him. Accordingly Hanuman stayed with Sugriva all the time as his
friend, philosopher and guide.
Hanuman is reputed to have mastered vyakarana - the science of
grammar. He is therefore called nava vyakarana pandita (master of the
nine sytems of grammar). Rama pointed this out to LakShmana when they
meet Hanuman for thr first time in Kishkinda forests.
Hanuman met them taking the form of a celibate
(brahmachari) and engaged LakShmana in a conversation in a bid to
find out their identity as Sugriva was afraid that they might have
been sent by Vali to kill him. Rama did not speak a word himself,
but was just listening to the conversation. He concluded that Hanuman
was no ordinary person as none but an erudite person could speak in
that polished manner. He points out these characteristics in
Hanuman's speech that made him to arrive at this conclusion to
LakShmana. Rama , in his admiration, said: (Valmiki
Ramayana.Kishkindha Kanda.3-28 to 33).
नानृग्वेदविनीतस्य नायजुर्वेदधारिणः ।
नासामवेदविदुषः शक्यमेवं विभाषितुम् ॥ २८।
नूनं व्याकरणं कृत्स्नमनेन बहुधा श्रुतम् ।
बहु व्याहरतानेन न किञ्चिदपशब्दितम् ॥ २९।
न मुखे नेत्रयोश्चापि ललाटे च भ्रुवोः तथा ।
अन्येष्वपि च सर्वेषु दोषः संविदितः क्वचित् ॥ ३०।
अविस्तरमसन्दिग्धमविलम्बितमव्ययम् ।
उरःस्थं कण्ठगं वाक्यं वर्तते मध्यमस्वरम् ॥ ३१।
संस्कारमसम्पन्नामद्भ्तामविलम्बिताम् ।
उच्चारयति कल्याणीं वाचं हृदयकर्षिणीम् ॥ ३२।
अनया चित्रया वाचा त्रिस्थानव्यञ्जनस्थया ।
कस्य नाराध्यते चित्तमुद्यतासेररेरपि ॥ ३३।
   Rough translations of these verses are given below.
To speak in the way he (Hanuman) has done is not possible for one who
has not studied Rig veda ,Yajurveda and also Sama
veda with meaning. Surely he had studied the entire range of grammar
thoroughly, as
is clear from the fact that nothing has been wrongly worded by him
even though he spoke a great deal. No fault of expression was noticed
anywhere in his face, or eyes, or forehead or
eyebrows or in anyone of his limbs.The speech emanating from his
bosom and articulated by his throat is marked by abscence of
prolixity, is unambiguous and unfaltering. It does not make a grating
impression on one's ears, uttered as it were in a modulated tone. He
utters a wholesome, distinct and remarkable speech that is
gramatically correct, fluent and delightful to the mind. Whose mind
will not be rendeed favourable by this wonderful speech which has its
seat in the three articulating organs (the bosom, throat and head)?.
The mind even of an enemy with his sword uplifted will be made
friendly thereby.
Please note that this encomium is paid by Rama who himself is reputed
to be an eloquent speaker and had studied all the shastras like
Hanuman. This is stated in the very beginning of Ramayana by sage
Narada to Valmiki. In Narada's words:  Rama is  वाग्मी or eloquent
and: वेदवेदान्त तत्त्वज्ञः knows the truth of the vedas and the
six sciences (grammar etc.) auxiliary to them and
सर्वशास्त्रार्थतत्त्वज्ञः स्मृतिमान् प्रतिमानवान्: knows the
real meaning of all the scriptures, has a sharp memory and is
possessed of quick wit. Sage Agastya also mentioned this fact to Rama
when he was narrating the life of Hanuman. The sage said:  
सर्वासु विद्यासु तपोविधाने प्रस्पर्धतेऽयं हि गुरुं सुराणाम् ।
सोऽयं नवव्याकरणार्थवेत्ता ब्रह्मा भविष्यत्यपि ते प्रसादात् ॥

Sita also paid compliments to Hanuman's qualities of speaking. This
was when he conveyed to her Rama's victory in the battle with Ravana.
She said: ( Valmiki Ramayana. Yuddha kanda. 113 - 26). 
अतिलक्षण-सम्पन्नं माधुर्यगुण-भूषणम् ।
बुद्ध्या-ह्यष्टाङ्गया युक्तं त्वमेवार्हसि भाषितुम् ॥
᳚You alone are competent to speak words that are endowed with the
mark of quality, sweet in expression, adorned with virtues, alert in
mind that is characterised by (the well known) eight excellences.᳚
Buddhi is the awakened, alert mind. The ashtanga, the eight qualities
of Buddhi, a sound and ripe intellect are given in the following
verse of the Nitisara Kamandaka quoted by the commentators.
शुश्रूषा श्रवणं चैव ग्रहणं धारणं तथा ।
ऊहोऽपोहोऽर्थविज्ञानं तत्त्वज्ञानं च धीगुणाः ॥
They are: (1) keenness to hear discourses especially on spiritual
topics, (2) readiness to hear such topics, (3) receptivity, (4)
retentive power, (5) reasoning for and, (6) against a proposition,
(7) the faculty of comprehension and (8) realisation of the truth.

No wonder, then, that Rama being a shrewd person observed Hanuman's
bearing combined with his gift of powers of communication and concluded
that he was suited to be an ideal messenger. Rama stated this after
listening to
Hanuman's introductory talk in Kishkinda (referred to above). Rama
said (Valmiki Ramayana. Kishkinda Kanda. 3 - 34, 35) 
एवं विधो यस्य दूतो न भवेत् पार्थिवस्य तु ।
सिद्ध्यन्ति हि कथं तस्य कार्याणां गतयोऽनघ ॥ ३४।
एवङ्गुणगणैर्युक्ता यस्य स्युः कार्यसाधकाः ।
तस्य सिद्ध्यन्ति सर्वेर्था दूतवाक्यप्रचोदिताः ॥ ३५।
How can the progress of undertakings of a king in whose service no
such envoy exists actually meet with success? By the very pleading of
an envoy, all the objects of  a sovereign in whose service there
happen to be agents adorned with such virtues are surely
accomplished. Manu prescribes certain qualifications that a king
should look for in a messenger. He says:
दूतं चैव प्रकुर्वीत सर्वशास्त्रविशारदम् ।
इङ्गिताकारचेष्टज्ञं शुचिं दक्षं कुलोद्गतम् ॥

अनुरक्तः शुचिऱ्दक्षः स्मृतिमान्देशकालवित् ।
वपुष्मान्वीतभीर्वाग्मी दूतो राज्ञः प्रशस्यते ॥

Roughly translated, these verses say that the king should select one
who is expert in scriptures, who could read the intention from
gestures, physical appearances and features, who is a man of
character, clever and belonging to a high family. He should love his
king, be pious, dexterous, intelligent, should feel easy at any
place, time or circumstance, handsome and strongly built, fearless
and a good orator. We find that Hanuman possessed all these
qualifications and  was fit to be a messenger. Rama had studied the
qualities of Hanuman and had no difficulty in chosing him to be his
messenger.

Rama, though he claimed himself to be Dasaratha's son, and tried to
act like a mortal could not conceal his real identity from the eyes
of the devotee Hanuman. So, Hanuman did not waste even a second, but
surrended at Rama's feet. Prahlada classifies devotion into nine
kinds. He said this in his reply to his father Hiranyakasipu when he
was asked to say what according to him was the best he learnt at the gurukula.

श्रवणं कीर्तनं विष्णोः स्मरणं पादसेवनम् ।
अर्चनं वन्दनं दास्यं सख्यं आत्मनिवेदनम् ॥

इति पुंसार्पिता विष्णौ भक्तिश्चेन्नवलक्षणा ।
क्रियते भगवत्यद्धा तन्मन्येऽधीतमुत्तमम् ॥
(Shri Bhagavata. 7-5-23 and 24).
The nine types of devotion that Prahlada talks about are:(1) to hear
the names, glories and stories of the Lord, (2) to chant them, (3) to
remember Him (as well as His names and stories, (4) to wait upon Him,
(5) to offer worship, (6) to offer salutations to Him, (7) to
dedicate one's actions to Him, (8) to cultivate friendship with Him
and (9) to offer one's body and belongings to Him.
Hanuman's devotion comes under the seventh category (viz.) the dasya
bhakti (i.e.)
devotedness to the Lord with a sense of service. He proudly proclaimed
himself to be the servant of Rama in Lanka when he was surrounded by
the solders of Ravana in the Ashoka Vana. दासोऽहं कोसलेन्द्रस्य
रामस्याक्लिष्टकर्मणः ।  (Valmiki Ramayana. Sundara Kanda - 42-34)

Also his is a solitary example of this type of devotion. This is
stated in the following popular verse.
श्रीविष्णोः श्रवणे परीक्षिदभवद् वैयासिकिः कीर्तने
प्रह्लादःस्मरणे तदङ्घ्रिभजने लक्ष्मीः पृथुः पूजने ।
अक्रूरस्त्वभिवन्दने कपिपतिर्दास्येऽथ सख्येऽर्जुनः
सर्वस्वात्मनिवेदने बलिरभूत् कृष्णाप्तिरेषां परम् ॥

A devotee practising this type of devotion is inspired with a sense
of service to the Lord and feels that the Lord is his master and he
is His servant. He does not nourish any kind of ego but surrenders
himself, body and soul to the Lord. The master can expect any kind of
work from him. In the case of Hanuman, his devotion was so intense
that it transcended the boundaries of this particular type and
spanned the full extent of types 8 and 9 also: that is, he was
considered a friend by Rama and he also surrendered himself totally
to Rama. He tried to be in Rama's company as much as possible so that
he could enjoy His glories from close quarters. Also since proximity
creates affection, by being close to Rama, he could receive Rama's
love. He is the one chosen by the Lord to obtain His love as
mentioned by the Katha Upanishad that states (2-23)  यमेवैष
वृणुते तेन लभ्यः ।᳚  He is attained only by the one whom He
chooses᳚. This also brings to our mind the verse in
Varadarajapanchasat by the great poet Shri Vedanta Desika. He says:
सौशील्यभावितधिया भवता कथञ्चित्
       संछादितानपि गुणान् वरद त्वदीयान् ।
प्रत्यक्षयन्त्यविकलं तव सन्निकृष्टाः
       पत्युस्त्विषामिव पयोदवृतान् मयूखान् ॥ २७॥
One peculiarity of the types 4, 7,8 and 9 of devotions is that it
involves acceptance by the other party, namely the Lord also. One
cannot claim himself to be the Lord's friend or servant unless the
Lord also accepts the offer of friendship or service. Did Rama accept
Hanuman's services? We find that Rama unhesitatingly acknowledged his
services. He told the sage Agastya that but for Hanuman he could not
have had the news about Sita languishing in Lanka, win the war with
Ravana, regain Sita, Laksmana and others. (Valmiki Ramayana. Uttara
Kanda. 35-9 and 10)
एतस्य बाहुवीर्येण लङ्का सीता च लक्ष्मणः ।
प्राप्ता मया जयश्चैव राज्यं मित्राणि बान्धवाः ॥ ९॥

हनुमान् यदि मे न स्याद् वानराधिपतेः सखा ।
प्रवृत्तिमपि को वेत्तुं जानक्याः शक्तिमान् भवेत् ॥ १०॥

   This is evident from the following incident  narrated in Uttara
Kanda. After Rama's coronation, all those who all those who helped
him were given presents and given leave to depart.  Rama sends back
other friends, including monkeys, bears and ogres. At that time
Hanuman said 
स्नेहो मे परमो  राजंस्त्वयि तिष्ठतु नित्यदा ।
भक्तिश्च नियता वीर भावो नान्यत्र गच्छतु ॥ १६॥

याव्द्रामकथा वीर चरिष्यति महीतले ।
तावच्छरीरे वत्सन्तु प्राणा मम न संशयः ॥ १७॥

Hanuman pleaded saying ᳚may my supreme affection for you stand for
ever. May my devotion to you be constant. Let not my love be diverted
to anyone else. May life continue in my body as long as your story
remains current on this earth. On hearing this, Rama was moved and
said
एकैकस्योपकारस्य प्राणान् दास्यामि ते कपे ।
शेषस्येहोपकाराणां भवाम ऋणिनो वयम् ॥ २३।
मदङ्गे जीर्णतां यातु यत् त्वयोपकृतं कपे ।
नरः प्रत्युपकाराणामापत्स्वायति पात्रताम् ॥ २४।
In reply Rama  said ᳚you have done me numerous services. For anyone
of them my life is an adequate return. If my life is pledged in
return for one of your services then I shall be in debt in respect of
others. I shall be indebted to you in a manner that I can never think
of repaying you. Let there be no occassion for me to repay your
services; for one deserves to be requitted for services rendered onle
when one is in trouble.᳚ Can there be a better way of acknowledging
the services rendered by Hanuman?
Incidentally the above request by Hanuman whose whole being was
imbued with the spirit of service to the Lord shows that such a
devotee will not accept any of the many types of liberation. He is
content with the thought that Lord to whom services has been offered
by him had accepted his services.This was said by Lord Kapila in His
advice to His mother Devahuti.
सालोक्यसार्ष्टिसामीप्यसारूप्यैकत्यमप्युत ।
दीयमानं न गृह्णन्ति विना मत्सेवनं जनाः ॥(Shri Bhagavata.
3-30-13).
Hanuman had other endearing qualities too. Sita found in him the
following qualities:energy, firmness, renown, dexterity, competence,
modesty, prudence and intelligence. Rama had given a beautiful pearl
necklace  (given to him by the wind-god) to Sita. She, in turn, with
the consent of Rama gave it to Hanuman with whom she was very pleased
and found the above said qualities in him.
तेजो धृतिर्यशो दाक्ष्यं सामर्त्यं विनयो नयः ।
पौरुषं विक्रमो बुद्धिर्यस्मिन्नेतानि नित्यदा ॥
(Valmiki Ramayana.Yuddha Kanda.128-82.)
That is why it is said that one who worships Hanuman will inherit
these qualities. This is mentioned in this following popular verse.
बुद्धिर्बलं यशो धैर्यं निर्भयत्वमरोगता ।
अजाड्यं वाक्पटुत्वं च हनुमत्स्मरणाद् भवेत् ॥

Hanuman is renowned for his great strength.  In North India he is
known as Bajrang Bali. This is a dialectical variation of the word
वज्राङ्ग बली  (vajranga balee) implying he has a body strong as
Indra's Vajrayuda. But he was equally known for his humility because
of which he preferred to call himself as the servant of
Rama.(दासोऽओहं कोशलेन्द्रस्य रामस्य ). With the combination
of these qualities and gift of supernatural powers got even when he
was a child he could easily accomplish great feats like crossing the
ocean, bringing the mountain etc.. which no mortal can even think of.
The great poet Kalidasa, known for his similies,  describes Hanuman's
crossing of the ocean with an apt simile thus.मारुतिः सागरं
तीर्णः संसारमिव निर्ममः । Hanuman crossed the ocean like one
having no attachments goes across the ocean of samsara. Hanuman
himself talked of his ability to perform superhuman acts to Rama when
he said ᳚whenever Hanuman takes a pledge fate itself is nullified and
death turns into life᳚.हनुमति कृतप्रतिज़्ञे दैवमदैवं
यमोऽप्यर्यमः ।(Hanumannataka.XIII-16) This is not an idle boast
but the result of his immense faith that with Rama's blessings he
could accomplish anything.
It was said earlier that Hanuman was blessed with long life by Rama.
So, though he served Rama in the Treta Yuga he continued to live and
was present during the Lord's descent as Krishna in the next Dwapara
Yuga. He had a meeting with the Pandava prince Bhima. This is
mentioned in the Aranya Parva of Mahabharata. Initially Bhima could
not make out who the monkey was. But later on when Hanuman disclosed
his identity, Bhima was overjoyed and saluted him. He sought
Hanuman's blessings. Hanuman  was only too happy to bless him. He
said he could not take up arms and fight in the ensuing KurukShetra
war: but he would be seated in the banner of Arjuna and discourage
his enemies by his loud roars. This is referred to in the Bhagavat
Gita (Ch1-20) wherein  Arjuna is called  कपिध्वजः -one with
the mark of monkey in his flag. 
अथ व्यवस्थितान्दृष्ट्वा धार्तराष्ट्रान् कपिध्वजः ।
प्रवृत्ते शस्त्रसम्पाते धनुरुद्यम्य पाण्डवः ॥
As a result, he had the great fortune to listen to the song celestial
- Bhagavat Gita- first hand as it flowed out of the sacred lips of
the Lord.  The Muktikopanishad says that he had earlier learnt the
upanishads from Rama in Ayodhya.  According to
a popular verse Gita is the milk drawn from the upanishads - the cow.
Krishna milked the cow using Arjuna as the calf.
सर्वोपनिषदो गावो दोग्धा गोपालनन्दनः ।
पार्थो वत्सः सुधीर्भोक्ता दुग्धं गीतामृतं महत् ॥
Hanuman,  having studied the upanishads at the feet of the Lord
already, listened to the teaching of Gita from the Lord (as Krishna)
with rapt attention and
could understand the purport of Gita without difficulty.
The saint composer Thyagaraja says in his song Gitartamu that the
true meaning of Gita was grasped only by Hanuman the savant.

HANUMAN AS GURU. The Ramayana of Valmiki is known as Itihasa or a
historical narrative. But, for a devout Hindu, it is not merely a
narrative but a book of great spiritual significance. It was the
supreme Being who incarnated as Rama to carry out certain specific
tasks. This is mentioned in the following popular verse:
वेदवेद्ये परेपुंसि जाते दशरतात्मजे ।
वेदः प्राचेदसादसीत् साक्षात् रामामायणात्मना ॥
When the Supreme Being, who is to be known (only)
on the authority of vedas, was born as the son of Dasaratha, the
vedas became Ramayana through (the agency of) the sage Valmiki. This
implies that the Ramayana is vedas in the form of the story of Rama.
That is why the great book has been rendered in many Indian
Languages. Many commentaries have been written on it and will
continue to be written in future also. The ardent devotees of Rama
have the habit of regularly reading one or more chapters of the text
daily. They believe that the holy book has the power to ward off or
alleviate the evil effects of past karma. Great acharyas have dived
deep into the sacred text and coaxed rare interpretations that are a
great treat to chew and digest. They substantiate their
interpretations with quotations from  vedas, upanishads and works of
saints and philosophers.  A phrase from a popular
verse describes this phenomenon  by comparing Ramayana to the ocean.
   समुद्रमिव रत्नाढ्यम् । The ocean  is believed to be the repository
of precious stones. So it is known as रत्नाकरः.
   A casual vistor to tha sea may take a stroll along
the beach and come across some shells cast by the waves. A novice
diver will be able to dive to a short depth only and may chance upon
one or few diamonds of little value. The more experienced diver can
plunge to greater depth, stay for a longer time and find many more
valuable diamonds. But the case of an experienced one is very
different. He has studied the characteristics of the ocean in his
area. He is equipped with special equipments and will be able to go
down to greater depths, stay for as long as is required. He can make
a thorough search of the dark recesses that could not have been
accessed by the lesser divers and gather very rare gems. Similar is
the case with Ramayana. It has, just like other spiritual
texts the capacity to divulge newer and rare meanings pari passu
with one's scholarship, faith and devotion.
No wonder then then a devotee uses Ramayana
to aid on the spiritual path.
A guru is a must for one who wants to proceed on the spiritual path.
One has to seek a guru to know the truth about God. Krishna says this
in Gita.(4-34).
तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया ।
उपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्वदर्शिनः ॥
The Munadakopanishad also says that one should approach a guru and
gain knowledge from him only.
तद्विज्ञानार्थं स गुरुमेवाभिगच्छेत्
समित्पाणिः श्रोतियं ब्रह्मनिष्ठम् ॥(1-2-12).
A discussion on the need for a guru and his qualifications are
available in Gurvashtakam with meaning in this site. As said earlier
Rama is the Supreme Being who incarnated as Dasaratha's son. He may
be worshipped either in Hisसगुण  aspect; that is as the Lord
with attributes or in Hisनिर्गुणम्  aspect. In the निर्गुणम् aspect
the supreme Being is spoken of in the upanishads as being
without form and beyond sense perception.
अशब्दमस्पर्शमरूपमव्ययं तथारसं नित्यमगन्धवच्च यत् ।
अनाद्यनन्तं महतः परं ध्रुवं निचाय्य  तन्मृत्युमुखात्
प्रमुच्यते ॥ (Kathopanishad.(1-3-15). Conceiving of such a Being
which is not accessible to one's senses and then worshipping Him is
obviously a very difficult job. This is beyond the reach of most
people and not an attractive proposition too. In view of this, our
scriptures allow us to worship God in a form that appeals to us.
Thus, one may worship the Lord as Rama, Krishna, Ganapathi, Devi
etc., in a picture or icon or any other suitable medium. Krishna, in
Gita, says (7-21) that He accepts such a worship done with faith.
यो यो यां यां तनुं भक्तः श्रद्धयाऽर्चितुमिच्छति ।
तस्य तस्याचलां श्रद्धां तामेव विदधाम्यहम् ॥
Such devotees who worship the Lord with form also make progress. The
Lord endows them with necessary wisdom by which they can reach Him
as their own Self.
तेषां सततयुक्तानां भजतां प्रीतिपूर्वकम् ।
ददामि बुद्धियोगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते ॥ (10-10).
     The saint composer Thyagaraja was a great devotee of Rama and
worshipped Rama in an icon, but  had described Rama in both forms in
his songs. The saint Sadasiva Brahmendra had said in one of his songs
begining खेलति मम हृदये that Rama is the supreme being
whose nature is  existance, knowledge and bliss that shines in his
heart.
शान्तिविदेह-सुतसहचारी दहरायोध्या-नगरविहारी ।
परमहंससांराज्योद्धारी सत्यज्ञानानन्दशरीरी ।
He took on a human form for a specific purpose. People use a tame
elephant to train a newly captured elephant. In the same way the Lord put on a
human form to teach righteous conduct to other men. Shri Bhagavatam
says this:(5-19-5) that is - the descent of the Lord in a human form
is to teach mankind the ways of the great and not merely to
exterminate the demon race.मर्त्यावतारस्त्विह मर्त्यशिक्षणं
रक्षोवधायैव न केवलं विभोः ।  Rama set an example to all by
strict adherence to the scriptural injunctions.  Hanuman had known
Rama and served him  devoutedly. As a result he had received Rama's
blessings in abundance. He also has all the qualifications prescribed
for a guru in our scriptures.
   According to one interpretation of Ramayana, Sita represents the
individual soul or Jivatma. It is living happily with Rama who
represents the supreme being or paramatma. Unfortunately, in a moment
of weakness, its attention is diverted from the paramatma, who
represents bliss, towards the wordly attractions outside.   That
these external attractions are illusory and not real is shown by the
golden deer. There is no such thing as a golden deer. The moment the
jivatma's attention is diverted and is separated from the Lord, it
falls a prey to the senses, as denoted by the ten headed Ravana. The
sense organs are ten. As the jivatma is held a prisoner in the
control of the sense organs, it repents its folly and pines for
reunion with the Lord. As the longing becomes intense with the
passage of time, the kindly Lord, who is never away from the jivatma,
senses the desparate situation. He sends a guru ( represented by
Hanuman) to meet the jiva. The guru offers consolation. He gives the
news about the Lord, instils the hope that the day of deliverance is
not far away and so there is no need for despair. The overly
perturbed jiva, thus gets encouragement, continues its prayers  and
looks forward to redemption.  Sure enough, the Lord comes and redeems
the jiva who once again joins Him. This is the story behind Ramayana.
Sage Narada includes Hanuman's name along with the names of renowned
sages like Sanatkumara, Vyasa and Sukadeva as great teachers of
devotion in his aphorisms on bhakti.(No:83 of Narada Bhakti Sutra.)
Even in worldly matters we find that when we want to approach a
highly placed dignitary, like a minister, for a favour we have to
observe the required protocol and go through the ᳚proper channel.᳚
The proper channel for approaching the Lord is via devotees. The Lord
appeared as Kapila to teach His mother Devahuti the way to
liberation. During the course of the teaching Kapila says more than
once that He is the Lord Himself. But nevertheless, He advises her to
have recourse to saints who have great devotion to Him. He Himself
did not directly grant her salvation. Similarly we find in Bhagavatam
that the Lord appeared as Rishabadeva and ruled the earth for a long
time. He decided to renounce and hand over the rule to His son.
Before departure He called His sons and advised them that the human
birth is very valuable and is not meant to be frittered away in
pursuit of petty sense pleasures that are enjoyed even by lowly
animals. Instead life should be used to work for attaining the
greatest good, that is liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
To do this one has to seek the help of sadhus. As in the case of
Kapila, He also hints that He is the Lord Himself, but advises His
sons to come through the proper channel.  Thus it is most proper that
one resorts to Hanuman for getting Rama's grace as is being done in
the following verses. Incidentally, we are told in the
Mundakopanishad (3-2-10) that one can get mundane prosperity by
approaching and worshipping a realised person.
आत्मज्ञं अर्चयेत् भूतिकामः । It is not wrong to ask for wealth
from Him as one requires money for having a comfortable life. And
money is definitely required for leading a religious life by performing
the religious rites  as ordined
by the scriptures. In Gita, Krishna says that he considers the one
who prays to Him for prosprity as His devotee. He welcomes such a
devotee also and fulfils his desires.
Let us move on to the stotram proper.  Rough translations
of the verses are given.

        नमोऽस्तु ते हनुमते दयावते मनोगते
        सुवर्णपर्वताकृते नभस्स्वतः सुताय ते ।
        न चाञ्जनेय ते समो जगत्त्रये महामते
        पराक्रमे वचःक्रमे समस्तसिद्धिसङ्क्रमे ॥ १॥

Salutations to you, merciful Hanuman, son of wind god! You are fast
like mind and shining like mount Meru. You have no equal in all the
worlds in valour or the art of speaking or  acquisition of
supernatural powers. You possess immense wisdom. (नभस्वत्
= the wind). मतिः is synonymous with बुद्धिः and means
intellect. So महामतिः is same as महाबुद्धिः । Shri
Sankaracharya defines महाबुद्धिः occuring as one of the
names (No.173) of Lord Vishnu in Vishnusahasranama to mean
बुद्धिमतामपि बुद्धिमत्त्वात् महाबुद्धिः  best amongst jnanis or
realised persons. We may, without hesitation, accept this meaning and
say that Hanuman is a great jnani and so most suited to be taken as a
guru.  

        रविं ग्रसिष्णुरुत्पतन् फलेच्छया शिशुर्भवान्
        रवेर्गृहीतवानहो समस्तवेदशास्त्र्कम् ।
        भवन्मनोज्ञभाषणं बभूव कर्णभूषणं
        रघूत्तमस्य मानसाम्बुजस्य पूर्णतोषणम् ॥ २॥

When you were a child, you once wanted to eat a fruit. You saw the
sun and (taking him to be a fruit) you jumped towards it and were
about to seize it. What a wonder! from the same sun you learnt all
the vedas and scriptures. Your endearing way of talking became an
ornament to the ears of Rama, the best of Raghus and immensely
delighted his heart.

        धरात्मजापतिं भवान् विभावयन् जगत्पतिं
        जगाम रामदासतां समस्तलोकविश्रुताम् ।
        विलङ्घ्य वारिधिं जवात् विलोक्य दीनजानकीं
        दशाननस्य मानसं ददाह लङ्कया समम् ॥ ३॥

You could find out that Rama was none other than the Lord of the
universe Himself. You became renowned as Rama's servant. You jumped
across the ocean quickly, met the hapless Janaki. You burnt Lanka
along with heart of Ravana.

        विलोक्य मातरं कृशां दशाननस्य तद्वने
        भवानभाषत प्रियं मनोहरं च संस्कृतम् ।
        समस्तदुष्टरक्षसां विनाशकालसूचनं
        चकार रावणाग्रतः नयेन वा भयेन वा ॥ ४॥

You met the Mother Sita in the (Ashoka) garden of Ravana. You talked
to her in a pleasing manner in beautiful Sanskrit. You also met
Ravana and indicated to him, through gentle persuation and also by
serious threat, that the time of the destruction of his entire
retinue is not for away.
Note. When Hanuman Sita in the  garden of Ravana (Ashoka) she was
surrounded by Ravana's servants. He was waiting for a suitable
opportunity to talk to her. At that time he was deliberating how to
talk to her and in what language. He felt that if he talked in chaste
Sanskrit spoken by learned brahmins she may imagine that Hanuman was
only Ravana in disguise and may be frightened. So he decided to talk
to her in the colloquial Sanskrit as used by the common people.
   वाचं चोदाहरिष्यामि मानुषीमिह संस्कृताम् ।
यदि वाचं प्रदास्यामि द्विजातिरिव संस्कृताम् ।
रावणं मन्यमाना मां सीता भीता भविष्यति ॥
(Sundara kanda. 30-17 and 18). This is referred to here.\

        महाबलो महाचलं समुह्य चौषधिप्रभं
        भवान् ररक्ष लक्ष्मणं भयावहे  महावहे ।
        महोपकारिणं तदा भवन्तमात्मबान्धवं
        समस्तलोकबान्धवोऽप्यमन्यत स्वयं विभुः ॥ ५॥

You possessed immense strength. You carried the huge mountain that
was shining brightly with medicinal plants and revived LakShmana (who
fell down unconscious) in the fearful battle. The Lord Rama, though
He is the intimate relative of all beings, considered you, who thus
rendered an invaluable help, a close relative.

        भवांश्च यत्र यत्र तत् श‍ृणोति रामकीर्तनं
        करोति तत्र तत्र भोः सभाष्पमस्तकाञ्जलिम् ।
        प्रदेहि मेऽञ्जनासुत त्वदीयभक्तिवैभवं
        विदेहि मे निरञ्जनं च रामदासदासताम् ॥ ६॥

Oh Anjaneya, wherever you hear the glories of Rama being sung, you
are present there with tears flowing from your eyes and hands raised
over your head in salute. Please grant me the grandeur of your
devotion and the untainted status of being servant to you - the servant
of Rama.

Note. It was said earlier that Hanuman's devotion was pure and
unalloyed. The devotee prays for such a sincere devotion here:  
because very often people pray to God for getting relief from some
suffering or for gain. In such cases one uses God as a means to
attain some material gain. This is an inferior type of devotion.
Also, please note the prayer here is for being a servant of servant
of God. In Bhagavatam, Krishna said to His devotee Uddhava that He
follows a sincere devotee. Thus by following such a devotee one is
sure to find Him. This is like saying that by locating a calf one
finds the cow which is inextricably tied by bonds of love to the calf.
The devotee Kulashekara prays for similar boon from Krishna in
Mukundamala. He wants the Lord to grant him the status of the servant
of the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the
servant of the servant of the Lord.
मज्जन्मनः फलमिदं मधुकैटभारे! मत्प्रार्थनीयमदनुग्रह एष Eव ।
त्वत्भृत्यभृत्य-परिचारक-भृत्यभृत्यभृत्यस्य भृत्य इति मां स्मर लोकनाथ!॥
One commentator had given an interesting explanation for Kulasekhara
wishing to be a devotee's devotee than just being a devotee. He says
that any one who is heriditarily rich is entitled to greater honour
than one who suddenly finds himself rich due to a windfall. In the
same way devotion secured by inheritance and that had percolated down
several layers of devotees is refined and has got an unique flavour
not to be seen in the devotion obtained by one's own effort.  

        अगण्यपुण्यवान् भवान् अनन्यधन्यजीवनः
        विमुच्य मौक्तिकस्रजं ददौ धरात्मजा मुदा ।
        भवन्तमालिलिङ्ग यद् रघूत्तमः स्वयं वदन्
        इदं हि मे हनुमतः प्रदेयसर्वमित्यहो ॥ ७॥

You are of inconceivable merit and greatly blessed unlike any one
else. Sita herself took out her pearl necklace from her neck and gave
it to you. Also Rama Himself embraced you exclaiming ᳚This is the
only thing I can give to Hanuman.᳚
धरा = earth. So, धरात्मजा  = daughter.of earth, meaning Sita.

        विदेहराजनन्दिनीमनोहरे वरे परे
        विदेहमुक्तिदायके विधेहि मे मनो हरे ।
        क्षणं क्षणं निरीक्षणं भवेद् यथा मयि प्रभोः
        तथा  निवेदयस्व मद्दशां दशाननान्तके ॥ ८॥

O Hanuma! please place my mind on Shri Rama, the beloved consort of
Sita. He confers liberation after the fall of the body. Please bring
my plight to His notice so that He may cast His glances at me very
often.
Note. What happens when one is caught in the range of His glance? One
of His names (No:393 in Vishnusahasranama)
is शुभेक्षणः । ᳚one with auspicious looks᳚. Shri Sankaracharya in his commentary explains
the significance of the name as follows.
 ईक्षणं दर्शनं यस्य शुभं शुभकरं,
मुमुक्षूणां मोक्षदं, भोगार्थीनां भोगदं,
सर्वसन्देहविच्छेदकारणं, पापिनां
पावनं, हृदग्रन्देर्विच्छेदकरं, सर्वकर्माणां क्षपणं,
अविद्यायाश्च निवर्तकं स शुभेक्षणः । ``भिद्यते
हृदयग्रन्तिः'' इत्यादि श्रुतेः ॥  His auspicious looks grants
liberation (mokSha) to those who seek liberation, grants pleasures to
those who seek pleasures, destroys the sins of the sinners, removes
all doubts, removes the knot of ignorance that ties up the mind  and
destroys all remnants of karma and also ignorance. What more can one
desire from Him? A similar idea is expressed in a highly poetic form
by the well known acharya Shri Vedanta Desika in his Shreestuti. This
poem is in praise of Shree (LakShmi) Devi.

आर्तत्राणव्रतिभिरमृतासार नीलाम्बुवाहैः
अम्भोजानामुषसि मिषतामन्तरङ्गैरपाङ्गैः ।
यस्यां यस्यां दिशि विहरते देवि दृष्टिस्त्वदीया
तस्यां तस्यां अहमहमिकां तन्वते सम्पदोघाः ॥ १५॥
The poet says that Her eyes are like freshly blown lotuses. They are
verily the dark clouds that pour rains of nectar that yield mokSha or
immortality. In whichever direction Her glances travel, to the end of
that direction, all good things are showered. In fact there seems to
be a competition amongst the good things to flood the devotee with
prosperity and relieve him of his material wants.

        इदं च पञ्चचामरं गृहाण दासकल्पितं
        समीरणात्मसम्भव प्रमोदमानचेतसा ।
        रिपून् षडान्तरान् विनाशयाशु दुर्दमान्
        पुनर्भवाख्यकर्दमात् विमुच्य पाहि पाहि माम् ॥ ९॥

O Hanuman! please deign to accept this hymn composed by your servant
with pleasure. Please destroy the six (internal) enemies that are
hard to be won over by me. Please extricate me from the mire known as
rebirth. Please save me, save me!
Note. षड् = six. अन्तरान् = internal. रिपून् = enemies.
The six internal enemies are mentioned in our scriptures are: कामः
क्रोधस्तथा लोभो मदमोहौ च मत्सरः । These are said to be
internal because they perturb the mind and are thus form obstacles
one faces in his spiritual path. They are difficult to conquer.
Krishna warns Arjuna to be careful and avoid falling a prey to them.
For example He said 
त्रिविधं नरकस्येदं द्वरं नाशनमात्मनः ।
कामः क्रोधस्तथा लोभस्तस्मादेतत्त्रयं त्यजेत् ॥
Here He calls lust, anger and greed as the three gateways to
hell.मदः   pride, arrogance.मोहः  = delusion, confusion.
मात्सर्यम् = envy, jealousy.
