<h2 itemprop="headline">उपोद्घात</h2> 
<h2 itemprop="headline">Prelude to Indra Sahasranama of Kavyakantha Ganapai Muni</h2>

Essential features of Deva - Indra as seen in Rigveda Mantras are very well woven together in the garland of thousand names - Indrasahasranama by Ganapati Muni.  He says in concluding verse about his work as ``these names are Vedic, so the scholars who know the Vedic terminology should understand etymological meaning of the words properly in accordance with the Vedic perspective''.

All that is said in Veda is the result of intuitive experience of Vedic Rishis - the Mystic poets.  I have attempted here to give a brief note on Vedic concept of Devas which would help an aspirant to understand the intention of Ganapati Muni who followed the path of Vedic Rishis.  It is essential to know the spiritual import of Veda and intricate characteristics of Devas invoked in Veda Mantras along with the performance of internal and external Yajnas to understand Indra Sahasranama.

Veda Mantras are the spontaneous expressions emerged from the Rishis who could visualize the knowledge stationed in the highest plane with their intuitive power developed from deep meditation (tapas).  The study of Veda in the light of Shri Aurobindo's ideas of symbolic language would give us tangible answers to the questions like Who are the Vedic Gods (devas) and the direct connection of these devas in our life.

Mantras tell us that the Devas are special powers in creation.  The word ``divine'' has its origin in Sanskrit word ``div''- ``Deva'' which has the connotation as
 देवो दानाद्वा । दीपनाद्वा । द्योतनाद्वा । द्युस्थाने भवतीति वा ।  (nirukta  7.15) -
``to give (bestow felicities)'', ``to shine (luminous)'' with Light and Knowledge, ``resides in higher world''.  This also means to make someone or something shine.  Deva is the all pervasive cosmic energy, the powers of the Supreme Godhead.

Rigveda (1.164.46) proclaims that ``There is only one God-head -  एकं सत्  ekam sat, but the wise people praise Him in different names - ekam sat viprA bahudhA vadanti - as Mitra, VaruNa, Agni, GarutmAn, Yama, MAtarishvA.'' Shri Aurobindo adds his observation to the above Mantra as: `` The Rigveda itself, indeed, asserts that the Gods are only different names and expressions of one Universal Being who in His own reality transcends the universe; but from the language of the hymns we are compelled to perceive in the Gods not only the different names but also different forms, powers and personalities of the one Deva.''

MaharShi YAska's Nirukta which dates back prior to the Second Millennium B.C.  also gives a detailed note about the appearance of different Gods in the Veda Mantras and their alliance with the God Supreme in Daivata prakaraNa (7.4).
महाभाग्याद्देवतायाः एक आत्मा बहुधा स्तूयते । एकस्यात्मनोऽन्ये देवाः प्रत्यङ्गानि भवन्ति । अपि च सत्त्वानां प्रकृतिभूमभिरृषयः स्तुवन्तीत्याहुः । प्रकृतिसार्वनाम्याच्च । इतरेतर जन्मानो भवन्ति । इतरेतर प्रकृतयः । कर्मजन्मानः । आत्मजन्मानः । आत्मैवैषां रथो भवति आत्माश्वः । आत्मायुधम् । आत्मेषवः । आत्मा सर्वे देवस्य ॥ नि. ७.४

``Gods are praised in different ways even though they have only one soul owing to their abundant felicities.  For one soul, other Gods become different organs (pratyangas).  Further, taking the Satva of Parameshvara, the Supreme Godhead, they indulge in creation and assume different functions.  They are praised in different names by Rishis.  The Soul is ratha, ashva, Ayudha, ishus and the AtmA - Soul of all the Gods.''

Shri Aurobindo observes that ``...  the separate functions of Gods emerged by means (out of) of their activities, their epithets, the psychological (तासां माहाभाग्यादेकैकस्य अपि बहूनि नामधेयानि भवन्ति । अपि वा कर्मपृथत्वात् - निरुक्त ७.५) sense of the legends connected with them.... ''. (From The Secret of the Veda. The Psychological Theory by Shri Aurobindo).  Many Mantras reveal how all Devas are different powers and personalities of the Supreme.  They take birth in us when invoked and give/increase their powers as per our aspirations.  Devas are called twice - born (dvijanma) since they take birth in the Universe and in every aspirant.  Indra is seen in the Mantras as the great bird (Suparna -garuda) without any abode.  This epithet indicates very significant power and activity (work) of Indra.  He is recognized as the ``divine mind and action'' of the Supreme by Shri Aurobindo.

The psychological aspects of Devas are clearly seen in many Mantras.  Shri Aurobindo says that he got the first clue for finding the psychological aspect of the God - Agni from the frequently used epithet of Agni as ``purohita''.  The word ``purohita'' in its separated form पुरः  + हितः  - ``placed (nihita) in front'' gives the symbolic meaning of the Divine Will or Force in all the human activities.

An aspirant invokes the cosmic powers in an inward journey on the spiritual path i.e., journey towards self-realization.  The Devas would bestow their felicities on an aspirant to divinize his life.  Divinizing means achieving all - sided perfection by spiritualizing our every day life.  Spirituality is different from religious beliefs and practices.  It is the understanding and consciously recognizing the Supreme Spirit which pervades the entire cosmos including all human activities.

The vedic sages recognized different types of powers pulsating around and within all the aspects of manifestations and had realized the conscious supra - physical beings behind all the cosmic powers - Devas.  They were aware that the minds of the individual human beings are not isolated.  They are all the projections of the cosmic mind.  They knew that they can increase their physical/ spiritual/ psychological powers by invoking the Supreme Power as well as the different Gods who are like His limbs to energize every aspect of human efforts.

Devas are invoked in Mantras to eradicate difficulties both in worldly life and spiritual life.  They regarded worldly life as important as the spiritual pursuit and aspired to lead happy and long life.  Invoked Devas to get health, power and prosperity.  Indra is seen in the Mantras as the Lord of the Divine Mind and Action who gives knowledge and increases the life force.  He is praised as the lord of abundant wealth and also the Deva who gives generously to aspirants.

<h2 itemprop="headline">Indra as the Lord of the Divine Mind and Action</h2>
Many Mantras tell us that Indra is the Lord of the heavens, mighty Power of the Gods, presiding over the Divine Mind, who descends with his lightning, abundant showers - the life - giving rains.  There is a common belief that Indra, the king of the Gods is ruling over the heavens, stands above the region of the clouds, deals with his famous weapon vajrAyudha, gives a death - blow to the demon called VritrAsura and releases the waters.  Traditionally, naturalistic interpretation of Vritra says that he represents the dark clouds which hoard the waters and the Indra gives the blow by his thunderbolt and causes the release of the waters.  We can find a reference of symbolic meaning of Vritra in MahAbhArata in ashvamedha-parva, (11-7-20) where MaharShi VedavyAsa tells YudhiShThira a secret that he had learnt from the Rishis in the forest.

इदं धर्म्यं रहस्यं च शक्रेनोऽक्तं महर्षिषु । ऋषिभिश्च मम प्रोक्तं तन्निबोध जनाधिप ॥

ततो वृत्रं शरीरस्थं जधान भरतर्षभ । शतक्रतुरदृश्येन वज्रेनेतीह नः श्रुतम् ॥ (अश्वमेधपर्व ११।७।२०) ``Listen , O Monarch of the Bharatas (Bharata clan), This secret dharma (truth) was told by Indra himself to the ancient Rishis.  They told me that ``we have learnt that Indra (then) did slay Vritra who dwells in the body, with his invincible thunderbolt - vajra.'' Here, the famous story of Vritra and Indra of PuraNas, is explained in spiritual perspective as the enemy within a human body (sharIrastham).

Vritra is seen in the Rigveda Mantras as the symbol of negative forces which bring obstructions not only in the spiritual sAdhanA of an aspirant but in all the works dedicated to the upliftment of people.  The killing of Vritra by Indra symbolizes the divine help rendered to overcome the obstructions caused by the negative forces in the developmental activities of one and all.

The doors of the ``secret cover'' of the spiritual knowledge hidden in the Veda Mantras, open up through the symbols.  This has great significance to the inner world.  It would enhance the psychological faculties which in turn lead an aspirant towards the intuitive power.  Indra is the Lord of the Divine Mind and Action.  Indra battles the evil forces on behalf of the seekers of knowledge.

इन्द्रो॑ दी॒र्घाय॒ चक्ष॑स॒ आ सूर्यं॑ रोहयद्दि॒वि । वि गोभि॒रद्रि॑मैरयत् ॥ ऋ. १.७.३
External meaning: ``Indra has fixed (raised) the Sun in the Heavens for the eternal view.  He, the Sun, inspired to show his light to the entire world being on the top of the mountain''.  The meaning of the second line of this Mantra in surface level: ``Indra smashed the hill (adrim) by the cows (gobhiH)''.  This does not give any coherent meaning.
Spiritual interpretation: Here, the pattern of symbols under which the spiritual meaning of the Veda Mantras are hidden has to be studied.  YAska''s Nirukta gives the meaning of ``gauH'' as ``Aditya'' and it also gives the meaning as ``the rays of the Sun .....  and all the rays are called gauH'' (सर्वेऽपि रश्मयो गाव उच्यन्ते । आदित्योऽपि गौरुच्यते, उतादः परुषे गवि पर्ववती भास्पतीत्यौपमन्यवः॥ नि. २.६).    It can be noted here that a commonly used word, ``goShThI `' which means ``the assembly of the learned people'' has the component of ``gauH - knowledge''.

Hence in the second line of the Mantra quoted above, the word ``gauH'' symbolizes, the ray of Light and the knowledge - jnAna.  The Mountain symbolizes ajnAna, the ignorance and the verb vi+ airayat means smashed.  Now, the coherent meaning emerges as: ``Indra smashed ignorance of an aspirant by bestowing the knowledge upon him''...  or as `` Indra destroyed the forces of ignorance using the Rays of spiritual Light.''

SHri Kapali Shastri, direct disciple of Shri Aurobindo, sums up his observation on this Mantra as ``the Supreme Sun, destroyed the ignorance of an aspirant which is symbolized by the word ``adri'' - the inanimate dark world (within oneself)'' by his rays of spiritual knowledge.

The role of Indra is evident as the Lord of the Divine Mind who helps the seekers by giving them the knowledge/guidance and helps them to develop the mental abilities and inspires them for proper actions.  The actions of the Divine Mind, Indra, can be broadly classified into three categories.  The first task is to manifest knowledge in seekers in several steps.

गाय॑न्ति त्वा गाय॒त्रिणोऽर्च॑न्त्य॒र्कम॒र्किणः॑ ।
ब्र॒ह्माण॑स्त्वा शतक्रत॒ उद्वं॒शमि॑व येमिरे ॥ ऋ. १.१०.१
O Shatakratu, Indra of thousand activities, the singers are lauding you and worshiping with Mantras.  The Seers of the Mantra rise and attain thee holding (like the) bamboo (ladder which helps to climb).

यत्सानोः॒ सानु॒मारु॑ह॒द्भूर्यस्प॑ष्ट॒ कर्त्व॑म् ।
तदिन्द्रो॒ अर्थं॑ चेतति यू॒थेन॑ वृ॒ष्णिरे॑जति ॥ ऋ. १.१०.२
When a seeker climbs from one peak to an other peak, he sees the task yet to be accomplished.  Then, Indra awakens in him (seeker) the object of the ascent.  Indra himself appears with the company of Gods for the aid (to guide) of the seeker.

The second task is the preparation and building up of subtle bodies which can absorb/sustain the knowledge.
सु॒रू॒प॒कृ॒त्नुमू॒तये॑ सु॒दुघा॑मिव गो॒दुहे॑ । जु॒हू॒मसि॒ द्यवि॑द्यवि ॥ ऋ. १.४.१
Indra is praised as the ``fashioner of perfect forms - surUpakritnumUtaye''.
``Rishis invoke Indra, to prepare the subtle body''.  The physical body is made of material, vital (prANa) and mental energies.  In its ordinary condition it is like an unbaked pot which will break if knowledge of great intensity enters it.  Hence, Indra has to create new forms or subtle bodies which can receive the knowledge and make use of it for further internal growth.  He prepares subtle body of the seekers to be able to receive vision and awakens the excellent knowledge in it.

के॒तुं कृ॒ण्वन्न॑के॒तवे॒ पेशो॑ मर्या अपे॒शसे॑ । समु॒षद्भि॑रजायथाः ॥ ऋ. १.६.३
``Gives knowledge to one who does not have it''.  Indra gives an appropriate form - peSha, which can sustain this knowledge.

The third task of Indra is to offer protection for seekers from the hostile forces called Vritra, Vala etc., who bring the obstructions in the worldly and spiritual paths of the seekers.  They are the forces of falsehood which conceal Truth or divide the Truth and they apply force to stop the flow of consciousness.  They operate in cosmic level and in the inner life of every individual.  Indra's victory over such hostile forces are hailed in many Mantras.  Rishis invoke Indra to help them overcome such obstacles caused by hostile forces by bestowing his strength on them.
Indra's role as the power of the divine Mind:  

इन्द्रा या॑हि धि॒येषि॒तो विप्र॑जूतः सु॒ताव॑तः । उप॒ ब्रह्मा॑णि वा॒घतः॑ ॥ ऋ. १.३.५ ``Impelled by thought, driven forward by the illumined thinker, Come O' Indra to my thoughts, I am ready with the soma-juice (delight) and eager to express it in speech (Mantras)''.

Interpretation of a Mantra (1-53-4) in spiritual perspective found in Shri Kapali Shastri's SiddhAnjana can be observed here.
ए॒भिर्द्युभिः॑ सु॒मना॑ ए॒भिरिन्दु॑भिर्निरुन्धा॒नो अम॑तिं॒ गोभि॑र॒श्विना॑ ।
इन्द्रे॑ण॒ दस्युं॑ द॒रय॑न्त॒ इन्दु॑भिर्यु॒तद्वे॑षसः॒ समि॒षा र॑भेमहि ॥ १.५३.४
``O Indra, propitiated by these bright oblations, these Soma libations, dispel our ignorance (अम॑तिं॒) with Rays - Knowledge and Life-force (with cows and horses-गोभि॑र॒श्विना॑).  And with the aid of Indra pleased with Soma - libation, we shall afflict the Robber and be relieved from enemies, be impelled together ahead.''

One can see in the above Mantra as to how the spiritual meaning as Light and Knowledge for the word ``gauH'' are more appropriate to get the cohesive meaning.  When Indra is prayed to remove ignorance - अम॑तिं॒ by cows and horses - गोभि॑र॒श्विना॑, it does not give any cohesive meaning if it is taken in the outer meaning.  One has to remove the veil of the symbols to get the inner meaning as the Knowledge and the Life-force (गोभि॑र॒श्विना॑).

Indra is seen in many Mantras as though appearing in front of Rishis/aspirants and actually helping them to win over hostile forces both in war and in spiritual pursuit.  Indra is praised as great hero.  His attribute as ``Garuda'' gives a clue about the actual appearance of Indra in front of Rishis; perhaps in a chariot that looked like Garuda.  This resembles the depiction of Garuda as the chariot of Vishnu.

त्वं पिप्रुं॒ मृग॑यं शूशु॒वांस॑मृ॒जिश्व॑ने वैदथि॒नाय॑ रन्धीः ।
प॒ञ्चा॒शत्कृ॒ष्णा नि व॑पः स॒हस्रात्कं॒ न पुरो॑ जरि॒मा वि द॑र्दः ॥ ऋ. ४.१६.१३
``For the sake of Rijishvan, son of Vidathin, you have slain Pipru and the mighty Mrigaya.  You have slain the fifty thousand KriShhNAs.  You have demolished the cities (of Shambara), just as old age (destroys) the body `'.

अवा॑चचक्षं प॒दम॑स्य स॒स्वरु॒ग्रं नि॑धा॒तुरन्वा॑यमि॒च्छन् ।
अपृ॑च्छम॒न्याँ उ॒त ते म॑ आहु॒रिन्द्रं॒ नरो॑ बुबुधा॒ना अ॑शेम ॥ ऋ. ५.३०.२
Here, the Seer of the Mantra, Rishi Babhru tells the aspirants, that `` I have seen the firm and secret abode of Indra.  The wise persons told me that we, the leaders, shall attain (understand) Indra being awakened (by him).  `'

Ganapati Muni recognises, Kundalini shakti as an aspect of the power of Indra.  He was blessed with the Mantra shakti by his practice of Vedic life and tapas by which he could heal the wounds.  It is recorded in his biography that a broken bone of his son in a bus accident healed quickly when he invoked Indra (meditated upon) this Mantra (8.1.12).

य ऋ॒ते चि॑दभि॒श्रिषः॑ पु॒रा ज॒त्रुभ्य॑ आ॒तृदः॑ ।
संधा॑ता सं॒धिं म॒घवा॑ पुरू॒वसु॒रिष्क॑र्ता॒ विह्रु॑तं॒ पुनः॑ ॥ ऋ. ८.१.१२
``The magnificent Indra restores again the bleeding from broken neck by joining the broken neck with the body to original condition even in the absence of healing materials''.

Devas in Veda Mantras appear tangible to aspirants and enigmatic at the same time.  A Mantra in 6th Mandala (6.47.18) says, ``To every form, Indra has remained the counter-form, that is his form for us to face and see.  By his maya powers, he moves on endowed with many forms, with his thousand steeds''.

Many events in the life of Ganapati Muni tell us that it is possible to get into the power of Indra by invoking and meditating upon his divine activities both worldly and spiritual.  Meditating upon thousand names in Indra Sahasranama of Ganapati Muni would help aspirants to achieve all round perfection in whatever work undertaken as well as in spiritual pursuits.

There are 10552 Mantras in Rigveda.  We may see the invoking of Indra in 1028 Mantras of Rigveda as a main deity as well as with other Devas mostly with Agni who is the Will power of Paramatma.

English translations of all the Mantras quoted here are rendered by Shri Kapali Shastri and Prof.  R.L.Kashyap.  There are many more aspects of Indra and his association with Soma.  A detailed note is available in ``Symbolism of Rigveda'', authored by me.

I conclude my humble attempt of very brief introduction to enigmatic Indra with a Mantra wherein he is addressed as Bliss (मृळ).

Indra is invoked to get all that is needed for happy worldly life and to achieve spiritual knowledge.
इन्द्र॑ मृ॒ळ मह्यं॑ जी॒वातु॑मिच्छ चो॒दय॒ धिय॒मय॑सो॒ न धारा॑म् ।
यत्किं चा॒हं त्वा॒युरि॒दं वदा॑मि॒ तज्जु॑षस्व कृ॒धि मा॑ दे॒वव॑न्तम् ॥ ऋ. ६.४७.१०
``O Indra, Mrila (blissful) make me happy, inspire me for getting things required for living, my intellect and speech.  Be happy with the offering of whatever little I speak for you and make me the possessor of Deva - the divine powers''.  Here, the import is on acquiring the power and qualities of Deva.  It is clearly seen when the Rishi says: `` Make me devavantam .. कृ॒धि मा॑ दे॒वव॑न्तम्  .''
<h2 itemprop="headline">Acknowledgement by Translator</h2>
Indra Sahasranama contains one thousand names of Indra that are woven together in one hundred slokas by Ganapati Muni.  All the words that are either synonyms or epithets of Indra are taken directly from Rigveda Mantras.  I have been studying and contemplating on the divine powers and personalities of Devas who are invoked in Rigveda since three decades.  However, it was a very challenging task to find corresponding words in English for thousand names of Indra spread in hundreds of Rigveda Mantras in different Mandalas that are ascribed to Indra.  I have pondered over the import of each word by virtually going through a large number of Mantras in which these synonyms and epithets of Deva - Indra are found.  I am greatly benefited by the spiritual interpretation given by my Guru, Prof. R. L. Kashyap for all the Mandalas of Rigveda (published by Sakshi Trust, Bangalore).  I offer my deepest reverence to him.
Finally I bow down with humility to the power of Indra which pushed me ahead in this endeavor.  I am only instrumental in his divine plan.  In this translation, I hope that English readers would get a glimpse of spiritual and psychological import of Veda Mantras visualized by great sages.

<h2 itemprop="headline">इन्द्रसहस्रनामस्तोत्रं सार्थम्</h2>
<h2 itemprop="headline">१ प्रथमं नामशतकम्</h2>
              इन्द्रोदेवतमोऽनीलः सुपर्णः पूर्णबन्धुरः ।
              विश्वस्य दमिता विश्वश्येशानो विश्वचर्षणिः ॥ १॥
1.  Indra is the highest deva among all devas.  He is the great bird (Suparna -garuda ) without any abode/ moves swiftly like mind.  He who has fully loaded chariot; tames all opponents.  He is the ruler of the universe.  He sees all.

Additional information: Indra is the great bird (Suparna -garuda) without any abode.  This epithet indicates very significant power and activity (work) of Indra.  He is recognized as the `divine mind' of the Supreme by Shri Aurobindo who has shown how all Devas are different powers and personalities of the Supreme.  They take birth in us when invoked and give their powers as per our aspirations.  When looked at spiritual interpretation; Indra being the divine mind moves swiftly like Garuda with strong wings.  He does not need any particular abode/His power is in everything.


              विश्वानि चक्रिर्विश्वस्मादुत्तरो विश्वभूर्बृहन् ।
              चेकितानो वर्तमानः स्वधयाऽचक्रया परः ॥ २॥
2.  Indra is capable of all (good) actions, he is above all, the Supreme, leader and creator of the universe.  Mighty Indra fills the universe with his rays (Sun, universal knowledge), moves by his own will/ Inherent Power (swadha) without any vehicle which needs wheels to move.


              विश्वानरो विश्वरूपो विश्वायुर्विश्वतस्पृथुः ।
              विश्वकर्मा विश्वदेवो व्ह्श्वतो धीरनिष्कृतः ॥ ३॥
3.  Indra is the creator of the universe, has universal form, universal life, widely extended in the entire universe with universal activity.  He is the universal deity, universal thought (divine mind) and stands above any reproach.


              त्रिषुजातस्तिग्मश‍ृङ्गो देवो ब्रध्नोऽरुषश्चरन् ।
              रुचानः परमो विद्वान् अरुचो रोचयन्नजः ॥ ४॥
4.Indra Deva who knows all the three worlds is perceived as sharp - horned bull on the move (always moving).  Most powerful, great Indra is shining with wisdom, he is self luminous and gives light (knowledge) to light - less (place/people).

Additional information:  
Here, light may be taken as the Sun - light and also as knowledge (spiritual wisdom).  Indra is known in Veda mantras as a bestower of knowledge by eradicating the negative forces operating in the mind of the aspirants.  Indra destroys vritra who is recognized as a negative force who blocks the light/knowledge and waters which are recognized as dynamic forces.
Rigveda Mantra 1.7.3.  says that Indra placed (raised) the Sun in dyu - loka for eternal vision.
Surface meaning of the second line of Rigveda Mantra 1.7.3.  says, `Indra smashed the hill (adrim) by cows (goobhih).'

Spiritual meaning:  
Indra destroyed the ignorance (adrim) of aspirants by (bestowing) knowledge (goobhih).
Vritra is seen clearly in Mahabharata (Ashvamedha parva 11.7.20) as the powerful negative force.  Indra destroys him with his special weapon Vajra.  Vajra is interpreted there as the discriminating power which can destroy the negative thoughts/instincts. (Shri Kapali Shastri)


              ज्येष्ठो जनानां वॄषभो ज्योतिर्ज्येष्ठं सहोमहि ।
              अभिक्रतूनां दमिता धर्ता विश्वस्य कर्मणः ॥ ५॥
5.  Indra is Jyeshtha (eldest/earliest form) Deva (divine mind of Supreme), he is the most powerful bull among mortals, gives supreme light.  Great Indra who has superb strength destroys those who work against cosmic order and sustains universal activity.


              धर्ता धनानं धातॄणां धाता धिरो धियेषितः ।
              यज्ञस्य साधनो यज्ञो यज्ञवाहा अपामजः ॥ ६॥
6.  Indra is the possessor/sustainer of wealth, supporter of supporters (of yajna), brave, driven by thought (mind).  He accomplishes and upholds the yajna.  He (himself) is the yajna.  He releases the water blocked by Vritra (negative forces).
Refer: Mantra 3.32.12 - Yajna becomes your protector in the killing of Ahi by vajra.


              यज्ञं जुषाणो यजतो युक्तग्राव्णोऽवितेषिरः ।
              सुवज्ज्रश्च्यवनो योद्धा यशसो यज्ञियो यहुः ॥ ७॥
7.  Indra desires (needs) yajna.  He is the master of yajna.  He is endowed with swift movements.  Protects the soma presser in sacrifices.  He has well designed Vajra (weapon / discriminatory power) The great warrior casts down the foe.  Glorious Indra is the son of power (Sahasa - Agni).
